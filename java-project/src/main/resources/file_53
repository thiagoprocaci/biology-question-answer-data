The effects of this persistent sodium current brings the resting membrane potential near the threshold. Furthermore, neurons do indeed fire and reach depolarization state due to these fluctuations in membrane potential, but those action potentials will not always cause a depolarization of the post-synaptic neurons, since those neurons have inputs of convergence from inhibitory neurons that produce inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. There is no moment or situations where all of your neurons are quiet.\nFurther information about persistent sodium current can be read in French et al.,1990., \"A Voltage-dependent Persistent Sodium Current in Mammalian Hippocampal Neurons\"., J.

Except for its associative learning capabilities prefrontal cortex is thought to have neuronal connections with many part of other brain structures and it must first gather information and integrate the information before deciding what to do. In your question the reward is the glass of water, the emotional response you would get to drink that cold water would aid to the decision making, and the motoric movement is initiated by the subsequent firing of neurons when you see the glass of water and when you recall/remember the feeling to drink it. Prefrontal cortex is therefore activated and can thereafter send action potentials to motor cortex and then to your peripheral nervous system and muscles, so you can pick up the glass of water.<\/p>\n\n<p>More about this here: <a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0959438800001926/1-s2.0-S0959438800001926-main.pdf?_tid=83268f2a-eed1-11e4-ae1f-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1430354614_ddc06d6aeae4543af28ebe02e29486cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0959438800001926/1-s2.0-S0959438800001926-main.pdf?_tid=83268f2a-eed1-11e4-ae1f-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1430354614_ddc06d6aeae4543af28ebe02e29486cc<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":31881,"question_id":31836,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31836/before-i-move-my-arm-the-brain-sends-signals-what-causes-the-brain-to-send-sig","last_activity_date":1430358553,"creation_date":1430265096,"answer_count":2,"title":"Before I move my arm the brain sends signals - what causes the brain to send signals?","body":"<ol>\n<li><p>Please tell me what causes the brain to send signals, how does the brain send signals?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>can you tell me what happens between the point when you make an intention to pick up a glass of water, and before the brains sends signals to the body which excites the muscles. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So what happens at the moment when you make the intention to pick up a glass of water but before the brains sends signals after you reach to pick up a glass of water.<\/p>\n","question_id":31836,"tags":["brain","muscles","central-nervous-system"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":1,"closed_reason":"too broad","is_answered":false,"view_count":291,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1430341992},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uSQnt.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15569,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15569/aleko-gharibashvili","reputation":6,"display_name":"Aleko Gharibashvili"},"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"DrRandy"},"score":0,"post_id":31870,"edited":false,"creation_date":1430312655,"comment_id":53729,"body":"I&#39;m not sure I understand your question.

There are absolutely differences between the metastasis and the primary tumor. One result of this is that people very rarely die of primary tumors, but rather from the metastases of those tumors.

After cells have metastasized they will be separate from the original primary tumor, and contain unique genomes.

They can also use their smelling to determine the direction where a certain smell comes from. This is achieved by the timing in which the senses arrive in different parts of the sharks nose. See references 1 and 2 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>While sharks have eyes which are similar to that of vertebrates, they have an additional reflective tissue called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapetum_lucidum\">tapetum lucidum<\/a>\" behind their retina, which reflects the light back and therefore raises the sensitivity of the eye. It seems that a lot of shark species are either colorblind (because they only have rod cells but no cones) or they had only one kind of cone cells which allows them only to see one color. For sharks it is obviously more important to detect objects than to see colors. See references 3 and 4 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sense of hearing of sharks is also highly sensitive and is able to detect sounds from far away. See also references 5 and 6 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most interesting sense of sharks is their electrosensory organ. This is also called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullae_of_Lorenzini\">Ampullae of Lorenzini<\/a> which is a number of sensory cells along the head and which are able to detect the weak electric fields that exist around living animals. This sense only works on a very short distance. See references 7 and 8 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally sharks have the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_line\">lateral lines<\/a> (which are present in most fish), which is an organ which detects movements and vibrations in the water around the shark. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_line\">Wikipedia<\/a> page for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>And for the sake of completeness (already quite nicely answered by @Susan in the comments), sharks do get cancer. All cures which are made from shark and claim to be able to treat cancer are pseudoscientific nonsense. This also endangers many shark species as they get radically overfished.

The short answer is, both. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Organ level embryogenesis:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The placenta connects the fetus to the uterine wall, and is the organ by means of which the nutritive, respiratory, and excretory functions of the fetus are carried on. It is composed of both fetal and maternal portions. The placenta can be traced right from the moment when the blastocyst is implanted into the uterine wall, though it takes a good portion of 12 weeks to develop.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NXHhY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After this adhesion, the invasion process starts, during which the cytotrophoblast cells from the trophoblast layer migrate deeper into the decidual layer. The formed vacuoles of the embryo become confluent to the uterus with the formation of the lacunar space 13 days after fertilization. The lacunar space will develop into the intervillous space for blood circulation a few weeks later. The placental progenitor stem cell is the cytotrophoblast cell. These cells are responsible for the cellular growth of the placenta, and they have the ability to proliferate and differentiate throughout gestation. The proliferating cytotrophoblast cells provide, after differentiation, the villous syncytiotrophoblasts as the outer cellular layer of the placenta.  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I took the above paragraph from here (<a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/780615_2).You\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/780615_2).You<\/a> can read more about it here (<a href=\"https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Placenta_Development\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Placenta_Development<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n<p>But for a serious scholarly study, you might be better off using textbooks.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic basis of placental development:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As for the second part of your question, that is the genetic basis of development for a placenta, allow me to lift a paragraph from a book. You must remember that the embryo as it were, is not a distinct entity genetically, in that it contains half of the genes of the mother, and half of the genes from the father. And this is where biology becomes more complex, beautiful and truly mind boggling. It involves intricate interactions between evolution, organogenesis and developmental biology.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These results [in mice] led to an extraordinary conclusion. Paternal genes, inherited from the father, are responsible for making the placenta \u2013 maternal genes, inherited from the mother, are responsible for making the greater part of the embryo, especially its head and brain\u2026 <\/p>\n  \n  <p>David Haig had begun to reinterpret the mammalian placenta, not as a maternal organ designed to give sustenance to the foetus, but more as a foetal organ designed to parasitise the maternal blood supply and brook no opposition in the process. He noted that the placenta literally bores its way into the mother\u2019s vessels, forcing them to dilate, and then proceeds to produce hormones which raise the mother\u2019s blood pressure and blood sugar. The mother responds by raising her insulin levels to combat this invasion, yet, if for some reason the foetal hormone is missing, the mother does not need to raise her insulin levels and a normal pregnancy ensues. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>In other words, although mother and foetus have a common purpose, they argue fiercely about the details of how much of the mother\u2019s resources the foetus may have - exactly as they will later during weaning. But the foetus is built partly with maternal genes, so it would not be surprising  if these genes found themselves with, as it were, a conflict of interest. The father\u2019s genes in the foetus have no such worries. They do not have the mother\u2019s interest at heart, except insofar as she provides a home for them. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>The father\u2019s genes do not trust the mother\u2019s genes to make a sufficiently invasive placenta; so they do the job themselves\u2026. Modern evolutionary theorists, led by David Haig, now think of the placenta as more like a parasitic takeover of the mother\u2019s body by paternal genes in the foetus. The placenta tries, against maternal resistance, to control her blood-sugar levels and blood pressure to the benefit of the foetus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from: Matt Ridley, Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters, Fourth Estate, 2000 <\/p>\n\n<p>For a more scientific explanation, I'd suggest reading the following papers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wang, Xu, et al. \"Paternally expressed genes predominate in the placenta.\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 110.26 (2013): 10705-10710.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hemberger, Myriam, and James C.

The main problem between humans and the apes we are most closely related to is that we have 46 chromosomes, while the apes all have 48.

A good example for this are crosses between donkey and horses (donkeys have 64 chromosomes, horses 62) to get <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule\">mules<\/a> (male donkey crossed with a female horse) or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny\">hinnys<\/a> (male horse crossed with a female donkey) which subsequently have 63 chromosomes and are infertile.

I am almost sure something similar would happen with this kind of vesicles as well. At least afaik. the immune system checks not just the presence of these antigens, but their composition as well. So if a RBC is under stress, then it changes the antigen composition on its surface and the leukocytes destroy it if necessary.

I added a paragraph break; the second paragraph seems most relevant to me:<p><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Obesity is a major epidemic, but its causes are still unclear. In this\n  article, we investigate the relation between the intake of\n  high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and the development of obesity. We\n  analyzed food consumption patterns by using US Department of\n  Agriculture food consumption tables from 1967 to 2000. The consumption\n  of HFCS increased > 1000% between 1970 and 1990, far exceeding the\n  changes in intake of any other food or food group. HFCS now represents\n   40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in soft drinks in the United States. Our most\n  conservative estimate of the consumption of HFCS indicates a daily\n  average of 132 kcal for all Americans aged > or = 2 y, and the top 20%\n  of consumers of caloric sweeteners ingest 316 kcal from HFCS/d. <p>\n  The increased use of HFCS in the United States mirrors the rapid\n  increase in obesity. The digestion, absorption, and metabolism of\n  fructose differ from those of glucose. Hepatic metabolism of fructose\n  favors de novo lipogenesis. In addition, unlike glucose, fructose does\n  not stimulate insulin secretion or enhance leptin production. Because\n  insulin and leptin act as key afferent signals in the regulation of\n  food intake and body weight, this suggests that dietary fructose may\n  contribute to increased energy intake and weight gain. Furthermore,\n  calorically sweetened beverages may enhance caloric overconsumption.\n  Thus, the increase in consumption of HFCS has a temporal relation to\n  the epidemic of obesity, and the overconsumption of HFCS in\n  calorically sweetened beverages may play a role in the epidemic of\n  obesity.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":20532,"question_id":20525,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1408139747},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3000g.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8804,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8804/raoul","reputation":1336,"display_name":"Raoul"},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":2,"post_id":20568,"edited":false,"creation_date":1408311910,"comment_id":32005,"body":"It would be great if you added references to your response!"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff41ba318da2785d0ba8f6a443db0fce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8644,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8644/user8669","reputation":102,"display_name":"user8669","accept_rate":33},"score":0,"post_id":20568,"edited":false,"creation_date":1408360063,"comment_id":32026,"body":"Thank you for your answer.

Other sugars will only be partly assimilated, or will require more energy to assimilate. If you take the example of glucose again, a glucose molecule requires active transport (meaning consumes ATP, the most basic fuel of your organism) to transit across the intestinal wall. Fructose is absorbed <em>via<\/em> free transport (<em>i.e.<\/em> no ATP consumption).<\/p>\n\n<p>This claim can be verified by opening any human physiology book, and while it is debatable whether fructose itself is deleterious, increasing the sugar amount in an already sugar-saturated environment clearly does not seem a good idea to me.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>I (inf3rno) appended the answer with further details:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Sucrose is split by digestive enzymes (sucrase, glycoside hydrolase) in the small intestine into fructose and glucose (1:1 ratio). By the high fructose corn syrup (HFCS hereafter) the fructose - glucose ratio is dependent on the HFCS type according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>. For example HFCS90 has 90% fructose, while HFCS42 has only 42% fructose (the rest is glucose).<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose is mainly transported by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins\" rel=\"nofollow\">SGLT1 (active transport, which involves ATP)<\/a>, while fructose is mainly transported by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT5\" rel=\"nofollow\">GLUT5 (passive transport, does not involve ATP)<\/a> into enterocytes in the intestines. After that the cells transport these sugars with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT2\" rel=\"nofollow\">GLUT2 (passive transport, not insulin dependent)<\/a> into the blood. Fructose and glucose is transported to the liver (hepatocytes) from the blood, with GLUT2.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the liver fructose is more dangerous than glucose, because it is transformed without any regulation. It uses the same pathways as glucose and mostly fatty acids are created from it, which increase the blood VLDL, LDL, FFA level and cause insulin resistance. The byproducts are urate and free radicals, which cause hyperuricaemia and oxidative stress. Hyperuricaemia cause decreased NO levels (by counteracting with eNOS and reacting with NO directly), which cause increased blood pressure due to vasoconstriction. Hyperuricaemia damages the liver and the kidney too. Too high urate levels enhance LDL oxidation as well, which cause atherosclerosis.

Most MHC alleles\n  differ from one another by multiple amino acid substitutions, and\n  these differences are focused on the peptide-binding site and adjacent\n  regions that make direct contact with the T-cell receptor.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>At least three properties of MHC molecules are affected by MHC\n  polymorphism: the range of peptides bound; the conformation of the\n  bound peptide; and the direct interaction of the MHC molecule with the\n  T-cell receptor. Thus the highly polymorphic nature of the MHC has\n  functional consequences, and the evolutionary selection for this\n  polymorphism suggests that it is critical to the role of the MHC\n  molecules in the immune response.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":31834,"question_id":31832,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1430246831}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31832/specificity-of-the-immune-system","last_activity_date":1430246831,"creation_date":1430243836,"answer_count":2,"title":"Specificity of the immune system","body":"<p>We know that the adaptive immune system recognizes foreign particles when their proteins are expessed of the the surface of T-cells, complexed with MHCs.

Evolution does not doom or treat unfairly as a dictator might. Evolution is <strong>merely<\/strong> the process of predominantly random changes in genetic material that result in a change in the expression of that genetic material. If it is a change that radically affects expression of a critical gene (say, that encodes the structure of hemoglobin), the organism experiences a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22011/\" rel=\"nofollow\">lethal point mutation<\/a> and ceases to exist. Evolution for that organism stops there; if death occurs before reproduction, the mutation is lost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution <em>seems<\/em> beneficial because the environment exerts selective pressures on life: if two animals (say, birds) in the same habitat (say, woodlands) eat the same food (say, larval insects), competition for resources exists, decreasing the numbers of both animals. However, if a mutation (say, a marginally different beak shape) allows even a slight chance that the animal will have a competitive advantage, it is kept in the population. A staggering number of mutations similarly either harmless or advantageous may eventually allow two animals to inhabit the same habitat without competition - a net gain for both animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>But there's no gift involved.

Owing to effects like co-dominance, incomplete dominance, collaborative (additive) effects of polygenes, our classical concept of dominance doesn't work. Having said that, there are certain ways in which a gene, if showing complete dominance can be analysed from the molecular level.<br>\nIn an individual heterozygous for a certain trait, the following possibilities exist:-<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Both the alleles, though different, code for a protein (which might be an enzyme or a regulatory protein) which is functional and is indistinguishable atleast in terms of its functions. In this case, no matter if the person is heterozygous or homozygous for either allele, the concerned protein will be in sufficient amounts and will always be functional. These alleles can be treated as the same allele while performing Mendelian analysis though their products might differ slightly, leading to formation of two (or more) functionally similar <strong><em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloenzyme\">Alloenzymes<\/a><\/em><\/strong> (as opposed to Isozymes which are similar enzymes produced by genes at different loci).  <\/p>\n\n<p>2) <strong><em>Haplosufficiency<\/em><\/strong>. In this case, one of the two alleles codes for a functional protein and the other either codes for a non-functional protein (or does not code at all). But, even in heterozygous condition where only one allele producing functional protein is present, the amount of protein produced is sufficient to show the phenotype and hence, even in heterozygous individuals, enough protein is coded for by the single functional allele exhibiting the normal phenotype. If the two non-functional alleles are present as a homozygous pair, no functional protein is synthesised and hence the phenotype is not shown (i.e a different phenotype is shown). Here, the functional allele is Haplosufficient (able to produce enough protein in heterozygous condition) and is called the dominant since it expresses its phenotype both in heterozygous and homozygous conditions. this is pretty common.  <\/p>\n\n<p>3)<strong><em>Complete Haploinsufficiency<\/em><\/strong>. Here again one allele codes for a functional protein while the other does not. But this time, if the functional allele is present in heterozygous condition, then the amount of the protein produced is not at all sufficient and hence the phenotype is not exhibited. Here the non-functional allele is said to be dominant because heterozygous phenotype resembles the phenotype of homozygous non-functional allele (where no protein is synthesized) since the functional allele is completely haploinsufficient (unable to produce enough protein in heterozygous condition). This method is pretty rare.(e.g rare autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita) <\/p>\n\n<p>If there is <strong>partial haplosufficiency /partial haploinsufficiency<\/strong>, the phenomenon of incomplete dominance can be explained. (heterozygous individual produces protein not sufficient for a full-blown phenotype but just a partial expression of the phenotype)<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Here, \"functional\" refers to being actually \"functional\" as in case of flower colour (anthocyanin synthesis) or just performing certain kind of a conversion leading to a particular effect on thephenotype.<\/em><\/p>\n","answer_id":11010,"question_id":11009,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1382450356},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1430176491,"creation_date":1382511703,"body":"<p>Fisher and Wright provided two different models in order to explain why newly arisen mutations tend to be recessive.

And b). the answer is yes... And no.<\/p>\n\n<p>A spasm can be the cause of a heart attack by causing the coronary artery to contract. When that artery contracts, it causes a dramatic decrease in blood flow to the heart. When the heart looses access to oxygenated blood it can cause chest pain (angina) or even an MI (Myocardial Infarction a.k.a. a heart attack). This spasm is can be caused by exposure to extreme cold, smoking and the use of certain recreational drugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, this type of spasm cannot be stopped with defibrillation. Treatment for these involves administering Nitroglycerin and then later treatment involving Statin drugs and such.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the terms you are speaking of, I don't see that that would be quite accurate. The most common cause of sudden cardiac death is VF (Ventricular Fibrillation) which is essentially an uncontrollable quivering of the heart muscle. I've never heard this described as a spasm though. Google searches of spasm and heart spasm have all lead to definitions of the word spasm and the coronary artery spasm mentioned above. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, within that, I think you have a valid point and a decent understanding of how things work, just perhaps not fitting under the definition of a spasm.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a defibrillator is used, it delivers a measured electrical shock to the person's heart and hopefully stops the chaotic electrical rhythm. I'm not sure if this part is correct however, I do not think you should look at that as a stretching of the muscle though. It is an electrical intervention that interrupts the former rhythm and hopefully the heart \"forgets\" what it was doing and returns to a sinus rhythm.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So, to summarize:<\/strong> A heart attack can be caused by a spasm; however, defibrillation does not help that type of attack. A defibrillator does not 'stretch' the heart but rather interrupts it's former rhythm. Because an irregular heart beat is not considered a spasm, I find it difficult to believe that any form of EMP would help it; however, I would love to hear that it has!<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on Ventricular Fibrillation, CAS (Coronary Artery Spasm) and AED's (Automated External Defibrillator(s)).

This is not as bad as it seems, as females and males may have different patterns of selection, different phenotypes of mutations all at the same time dodging pleiotropic effects. Hence mutations benefiting one sex will sometimes be deleterious to the other (i.e. their fitness effects are \u2018sexually antagonistic\u2019)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sexual Conflict:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Males and females have divergent interests in reproduction that are rooted in anisogamy and lead to distinct roles, due to sexual antagonism. Sexual conflict occurs between the same or different genes,  when there are different optima for a trait expressed in both sexes (intralocus conflict) or when there is conflict over the outcome of a male\u2013female interaction (interlocus conflict).<\/p>\n\n<p>Intralocus sexual conflicts are potentially very common. Researchers have found a strong positive genetic correlation between male and female fitness at the larval stage in the fruit fly (when interests of the males and females are essentially the same -> survive and grow), but a strong negative genetic correlation between adult male and female reproductive success (when the sexes are expected to have different genetic interests). This is possibly due to sexual antagonism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Interlocus conflicts occur when there is conflict over the outcome of male\u2013female interactions, so that the optimal outcome is different for the two sexes,as occurs in yellow dung fly mating behaviour. In a rare instance, wikipedia does a good job of explaining the example: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the yellow dung fly <em>Scathophaga stercoraria<\/em>, females can be injured\n  in the battles between males suitors. Males are selected to evolve\n  traits for competitive ability that would increase their reproductive\n  success, but females would evolve a set of antagonistic adaptations to\n  reduce their chances of being injured in battles between the males.\n  Therefore, there is an interlocus sexual conflict in males and females\n  that could possibly lead to an \"unresolvable evolutionary chase\" when\n  a novel trait in males increases their competitive ability while\n  harming the females<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>[5,6]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Parental Antagonism:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>An allele in a gene is said to be parentally antagonistic if it has an inclusive fitness benefit when derived from one parent (say the mother), but an fitness cost when derived from the other parent (in this case the father) <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many different theories out there, but the gist of it is essentially some process creating an asymmetry between the genes that you inherit from your father and mother (patriGENIC and matriGENIC), that causes differential expression of alleles (silencing the other copy) <strong>[2]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Parental Conflict:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When parent-offspring relations in sexually reproducing species are\n  viewed from the standpoint of the offspring as well as the parent,\n  conflict is seen to be an expected feature of such relations.

Note that this is different than a QTL.

To further localize the position of the cis-acting changes, we looked for the smallest chromosome region co-segregating with bilateral absence of pelvic structures in a cross between pelvic-complete [Japanese marine (JAMA) and pelvic-reduced (PAXB) fish (13)]. High-resolution mapping identified a 124-kb minimal interval, containing only the Pitx1 and Histone 2A (H2AFY) genes, which showed perfect concordance between PAXB alleles and absence of the pelvis (fig. S1A).<\/p>\n\n<p>Recombination in natural populations can also be used to narrow the size of regions controlling polymorphic traits in sticklebacks (18). We therefore tested whether markers in the Pitx1 region were associated with the presence or absence of pelvic structures in lakes with dimorphic stickleback forms: benthic and limnetic sticklebacks from Paxton Lake, British Columbia (PAXB/PAXL), and pelvic-complete and pelvic-reduced sticklebacks from Wallace Lake, Alaska (WALR/WALC) (fig. S2) (13, 14). Microsatellite markers located in an intergenic region approximately 30 kb upstream of Pitx1 showed highly significant allele frequency differences in fish with contrasting pelvic phenoytpes (P &lt; 10−35) (Fig. S1B and table S2). In contrast, markers around thePitx1 and H2AFY coding regions showed little or no differentiation above background levels. These results suggest that an approximately 23-kb intergenic region upstream of Pitx1 controls pelvic development. This region is conserved among zebrafish and other teleosts (Fig. 2A), suggesting that it may contain ancestrally conserved regulatory enhancers.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://scienceintheclassroom.org/sites/default/files/stickleback_2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://scienceintheclassroom.org/sites/default/files/stickleback_2.jpg<\/a>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SbFhp.jpg\" alt=\"Fig2\"><\/p>\n\n<p>\"Fig. 2.

The process of glucose breakdown i.e glycolysis is not a part of respiration. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCA cycle<\/a> is however considered a part of respiration because it is coupled with the ETC.<\/p>\n\n<p>Later it had been found out that molecules/ions other than oxygen such as Fe<sup>3+<\/sup>, Fumarate etc, can also serve as the terminal electron acceptor.

The naked mole rat is one of very few species of eusocial mammals and the relationship between its lifespan and body mass is very dissimilar to that of other rodents (ignore the bat points):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zP1Ui.jpg\" alt=\"Naked mole rat lifespan vs body mass\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Image from <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720708002888\">Buffenstein &amp; Pinto (2009)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a queen has a longer reproductive lifespan then over the course of its life it will create a higher number of offspring. This will cause their increased longevity genes to be more prevalent in the gene pool over time - <strong>as long as they are able to reach the limit of their reproductive lifespan and are not killed by externalities (accident or attack) in the meantime.<\/strong> Therefore this trait (longer reproductive lifespan) will be selected for as long as the queen is protected.<\/p>\n\n<p>Within eusocial colonies, there is often a protective environment (<a href=\"http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/21/pe7#R4\">Buffenstein &amp; Jarvis 2002<\/a>): there is usually a physical structure (nest or burrow); symbiotic bacteria and/or fungi creating a more hygienic microflora; and queens are also protected by other castes. This gives queens a lower incidence of death due to accident or attack which (from the reasoning in the previous paragraph) supports the selection of a longer reproductive life. This is likely to lead to longer lived workers since they share the same genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>However queens do tend to live much longer than their workers (<a href=\"http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/3/269.short\">O'Donnell &amp; Jeanne 1995<\/a>). This is probably due to their reproductive role. All the ants in the colony are investing in reproduction (whether by physically giving birth to young or by providing it with food and protection) therefore the normal relationship (reproduction and lifespan tradeoff) mentioned at the start is not relevant, but since the queen is the only individual reproducing, it will be the only one for whom lengthened lifespan is beneficial evolutionarily.<\/p>\n\n<p>A mean lifespan of 20 years has been observed in <em>Formica exsecta<\/em>, and a maximum lifespan of 28.5 years observed in <em>Lasius niger<\/em>. <em>Pogonomyrmex owyheei<\/em> has an observed maximum of 30 years, and mean of 17 years.

Suppose that there are 3 alleles, equally prevalent in the population at large and not under selective pressure during the inbreeding experiment. Let $p_j(i)$ denote the probability that, after $i$ repetitions the lines share $j$ distinct alleles between them. Let $p(i) \\in [0,1]^3$ be a vector whose $j$th element is $p_j(i)$. Consider the following equation: $$p(i+1) = M p(i)$$<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to calculate the transition matrix $M$ and explain the boundary condition $p(1) = [ 1, 0 ,0 ]^T$. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am lost on how to do this, I'm given the answer for $M$ to be $$\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac13 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\frac23 &amp; \\frac23 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac13 &amp; 1  \\end{pmatrix}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>But for example looking along the first line I would interpret this as $$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{There is 1 distinct allele between all lines at time t}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{There is 1 distinct allele between all lines at time t-1})$$<\/p>\n\n<p>However if there is a single allele between the lines at time $t-1$ then this means every line is homozygous for a single allele so why would that change at the next time step?!<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the boundary condition, I would of thought it would be $[0, 0, 1]^T$ since is the alleles occur with equal chance and you select a large enough number of lines, you should find all $3$ alleles between them.

Surely the number of lines we have makes a large difference, if every line is of genotype $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2$ and we would like the probability that there is a single allele between lines at the next selfing step, then every single line would need to become homozygous for the same allele, which seems unlikely if we have a massive number of lines.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can someone help me work out what is going on here? <\/p>\n","question_id":31755,"tags":["genetics","homework"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":51,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1430084293},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUIMk.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11538,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11538/galen","reputation":157,"display_name":"Galen"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d50eaca20365c51634c9452835c50ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14629,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14629/cactuswoman","reputation":1902,"display_name":"CactusWoman","accept_rate":60},"score":0,"post_id":31752,"edited":false,"creation_date":1430064796,"comment_id":53359,"body":"I just wanted to reiterate what Remi.b said that neither cats nor dogs are more closely related to rodents: they are exactly the same phylogenetic distance apart"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5925786f174975db18cbc83dd85e5c1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6592,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6592/pa%c5%adlo-ebermann","reputation":101,"display_name":"Paŭlo Ebermann"},"score":0,"post_id":31752,"edited":false,"creation_date":1430075658,"comment_id":53367,"body":"I guess this might depend on the definition of &quot;evolutionary distance&quot;.

There are also year-round populations of robins in the US, but probably not many (if any) in Massachusetts.

My robin sightings decreased over the first few weeks since I wrote this, however they're back in full force now. This made me curious enough to do further research, and I happened upon two fact sheets about American Robins, whose scientific name is Turdis Migratorius, meaning Migrating Thrush. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've extrapolated data from a series published by Learner.org entitled Journey North, and will be referring to and quoting sections of <a href=\"http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/robin/facts_migration\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.learner.org/jnorth/search/RobinNotes3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>As indicated by the thorough sources referenced in @fileunderwater's excellent answer, it's clear that not all robins migrate, and among those that do, there are a number of variables, many of which are not fully understood. Robins are considered nomadic, meaning they travel in many different directions, and, unlike other species, they don't necessarily come and go from the same location, further complicating the study of migration. <\/p>\n\n<p>In general, food supply is the robin's most important consideration, and weather controls the availability of that food, so a complex combination of the two appears to be the main migration trigger.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Migrators rely heavily on earthworms, caterpillars and other insects for the bulk of their diet. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>In the fall, they fly south because the ground freezes, locking them out from their favorite food, earthworms, and because winter weather makes it impossible to find juicy caterpillars and other insect food.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The same theory applies in their motivation to return from the south. Soils in the south can get so warm and dry that worms retreat deeper into their burrows during hot, dry spells, making them harder for robins to find. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Robins are easily overheated, so they become stressed and restless when the southern temperatures remain high for an extended period of time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The south to north migrators are programmed to follow something called a 37-degree isotope. They move ahead of warm fronts, the intention being to settle down where the temperature averages 37 degrees or more. That weather pattern also brings spring rains, causing the ground thaw that triggers the end of earthworm hibernation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The male robin migrates first. He bulks up by eating more than usual to sustain him through the arduous journey, which is why the first robins we see are generally chubby! (The male also has a much darker head than the female.) As @fileunderwater pointed out, in some areas robins have begun to arrive significantly earlier, while the ground is still frozen, so that extra preparation helps them survive for a time by eating berries and insects found in trees. If all else fails, some will re-join a flock and fly to a warmer area for a few days or weeks, which supports my recent observation.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Upon arrival, the male's job is to stake out a territory conducive to good breeding conditions. Once he finds an area that has a good feeding source, a safe place for breeding, and the right materials for the female to create a nest, he spends most of his time in a nearby tree singing. It's a unique sound rarely used at any other time, and it lets other males in the area know to stay away. <\/p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later, the female arrives. Her trigger seems to be related to  ideal nesting conditions. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She has no urgent need to return early, since there is nothing important for her to do until there is a good mud supply for building her nest. As a matter of fact, if she builds too early, hard frosts at night can weaken her nest. And if she runs out of food too soon before the nesting season, it can make it hard for her body to produce eggs. So she waits until conditions are more favorable and she can continue to get a reliable winter diet as long as necessary.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A few other fun facts about migration:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Robins migrate mostly at night.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>They fly at speeds of 30-36 mph, traveling between 100 and 200 miles per day.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>To keep from getting lost, they figure out their location on the planet in much the way sailors on the high seas once did--using the angle of the sun in relation to the time of day. If blown off course, they fly to where the sun will be at the proper angle.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Flock sizes during migration vary greatly. Although groups of 10-50 are the most commonly seen, they'll fly in groups as few as three or four, and I (the author of one of these articles) once counted 60,000 robins flying along Lake Superior in just 5 hours!<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>For various reasons, many robins don't survive migration. Scientists estimate that only 25% of fledglings born in the summer survive until November, and even many experienced adults die during migration.<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":31757,"question_id":30362,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30362/what-triggers-the-migration-of-robins","last_activity_date":1430073798,"creation_date":1426110740,"answer_count":3,"title":"What triggers the migration of robins?","body":"<p>I live in central Massachusetts, and have begun seeing robins, as we generally do in early March.

Clearly, spermatozoa have mitochondria; they make the energy needed for motility. Paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does enter oocytes. It is a persisting fallacy that only maternal mtDNA is present in humans because only oocyte mitochondria are present in the product of conception.<\/p>\n\n<p>This has been known for some time. According to an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nov. 1996, under <em>Evolution<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In vertebrates, inheritance of mitochondria is thought to be predominantly maternal, and mitochondrial DNA analysis has become a standard taxonomic tool. In\n  accordance with the prevailing view of strict maternal inheritance, many sources assert that during fertilization, the sperm tail, with its mitochondria, gets excluded from the embryo. This is incorrect. In the majority of mammals \u2014 including humans \u2014 the midpiece mitochondria can be identified in the embryo even though their ultimate fate is unknown. The \"missing mitochondria\" story seems to have\n  survived \u2014 and proliferated \u2014 unchallenged in a time of contention between hypotheses of human origins, because it supports the \"African Eve\" model of recent radiation of <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> out of Africa.<sup>[1]<\/sup> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, what happens to paternal mtDNA if it is indeed present in embryonic cells? Paternal mitochondria are targeted and destroyed.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While some confusion may still persist in popular science, research data clearly document that the paternal sperm-borne mitochondria of most mammalian species enter the ooplasm at fertilization and are specifically targeted for degradation by the resident ubiquitin system. Ubiquitin is a proteolytic chaperone that forms covalently linked polyubiquitin chains on the targeted proteinaceous substrates....Prohibitin, the major protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, appears to be ubiquitinated in the sperm mitochondria.<sup>[2]<\/sup> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A finding of a patient with severe exercise intolerance in whom the mutated mtDNA in muscle was shown to be paternally inherited challenged the concept of strict maternal inheritance of mtDNA (the mtDNA harboring the mutation was paternal in origin and accounted for <strong>90 percent<\/strong> of the patient's muscle mtDNA.)<sup>[3]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paternal mtDNA inheritance may have gone unrecognized in cases of mitochondrial disease with no clear maternal pattern of inheritance because mitochondrial haplotypes are rarely investigated in diagnostic analyses.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, a small study of 12 patients with mitochondrial myopathy failed to show Paternal mtDNA.<sup>[4]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>It is too simplistic to say paternal inheritance of mtDNA does not occur.

The mitochondrial DNA from three lambs in two half-sib families were found to show paternal inheritance. Our findings provide direct evidence of paternal inheritance of mitochondria DNA in sheep.

So first of all let's see the nerve classes and conduction speed from this and this wikipedia pages:<\/p>\n\n<p>Peripherial nerves can be classified into three groups A, B, and C (based on their diameter).<\/p>\n\n<p>Group A are the thickest (largest in diameter), are myelinated and have high conduction velocity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Group A can be divided to subclasses:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>'A' alpha nerves are 13-20um (micrometer) thick and have 80-120m/s\nconduction velocity (this equals 288-432km/h (meter/s * 3,6) or\n180-270mph (khm/h / 1,6)). These are associated with proprioception (this \nsubconscious sensation is responsible for us knowing how our body is positioned in 3D and where are our limbs compared to our body)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This means that in a fairly average 180 cm (approx 6 feet) tall human a stimulus on such nerve can travel the whole body of the person in 0,018s (with an average of 100m/s conduction velocity) How ever this is not the real case, I'll discuss that later.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>'A' beta nerves are about half as thick as 'A' alpha (6-12um) and\nconduct stimulus with 33-75m/s. Among others these are linked to cutaneous mechano receptors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Alpha and beta fibers can be both afferent (sensory) or efferent (motor)<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>'A' delta nerves are thinly myelinated and far slower than the\nprevious nerves with 3-30m/s velocity. These type of nerves are linked to nociception, cold thermoreceptors and make up the free nerve endings for touch and pressure.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>'A' gamma fibers are efferent fibers and with 4-34m/s velocity.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Group B nerves are preganglionic fibers (ganglions are hubs of neurons of the autonomic nervous system) and conduct stimuli with 3-15m/s velocity. Thes are 1-5um thick and myelinated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Group C are post ganglionic fibers (leading to the organs) and belong to nociceptors and warmth receptors They're thin (0.2 - 1.5um) and non myelinated. Their conduction speed is 0.5-2m/s.<\/p>\n\n<p>So different sensory types have different nerves associated to them, and this results in different conduction velocity of that stimuli. Thus the answer is yes there is difference in sensation lag times to different types of stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/0006899383906509/1-s2.0-0006899383906509-main.pdf?_tid=8e6ea386-e747-11e4-89d0-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1429525704_33bb151952bb761424b4e017bbb9712b\">this<\/a> paper scientist tested reaction lag time to heat caused pain and found the following:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DBDKU.png\" alt=\"lag time differences\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Researchers stimulated two different parts of the hand of test subjects, the thenar eminence - that is the base of the thumb, and the volar forearm - that is the same side of the forearm as the palm ( the lower part of your forearm if you imagine your hands palms down). As you can see on the graph the volar forearm has lower lag times that the base of the thumb after a certain level of stimulus.\nThese authors also made a control experiment to:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>estimate the sum total of time necessary for central sensory processing, the decision making plus motor execution times were measured in one subject for responses to suprathreshold auditory stimuli. Auditory stimuli were chosen because primary afferent conduction time is negligible. Latencies were measured in the same way as with the thermal stimuli. The tenth percentile (point at which 10 ~ of the latencies were faster and 90 ~ were \n  slower) was near 0.19 s. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So response to sound is pretty fast, but this as with the heat experiment includes the measurable response of the test subject, thus the value is higher than the actual sensation.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the heat-pain experiment the authors concluded :<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The conduction distance from the area stimulated to the spinal cord was 0.78 m in this subject. If receptor utilization time, rise time, and conduction time in the cervical spinal cord are ignored, then primary afferents that signal first pain must have a conduction velocity of at \n  least 0.78 m/ (0.33 --0.19) s, or 6 m/s.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The 6/ms velocity correlates well with the A-delta nerve's conduction speed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also here's another diagram on the distribution of lag times to different level of stimulus:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/p8mQV.png\" alt=\"latency to stimulus level\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The difference of lag times can result from the activation of differrent receptors. Temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius are more likely to activate warmth receptors only that have lower conduction velocity. The high numbers of slow (1-1,5s) response to these stimuli correlate well with the group C fibers for warmth reception. On the other hand, responses to higher and potentially more damaging temperatures, nociceptors are more likely to be activated and faster conduction of these stimuli result in lower latencies. Also the transition from high latency to low is quite smooth with increase of the temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Difference in nerve conduction values are not the only thing that occurs lag in sensation. These stimuli do not travel directly to the brain from receptors, but have to be transmitted to a sensory neuron, then these have connections in the spinal cord before stimulus can be transmitted to the adequate part of the brain, and then these neurons of the brain still have to process the signal. It is important to note that lag times are different from individual to individual.

A well-known example where two stimulus modalities are perceived as separate while they are in fact coming from the same event is a thunder heard <em>after<\/em> lightning. This is caused by the fact that sound travels at a speed much slower than light, and hence a thunder can lag lightning by seconds.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4Q3J.png\" alt=\"Thunder lightning\"><br>\n<sup>source: <a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/sound2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>In many instances, however, one event generating perceptions across stimulus modalities are actually perceived as synchronous while they are in fact offset in time due to differences in physical characteristics of the stimuli. Taking the storm as an example - when it is far away, the thunder is perceived as separate because the thunder lags by seconds. But when the thunderstorm is close enough, the auditory crack and visual lightning are actually perceived as synchronous, while in fact they are still offset because of the sound travelling so much slower than light. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the question becomes, as you rightfully ask, what are the <em>margins<\/em> in which stimuli across modalities can be asynchronous while perceived as one event? In other words, what is the <em>window of integration<\/em>? <\/p>\n\n<p>A review by <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Vroomen/publication/43535149_Perception_of_intersensory_synchrony_a_tutorial_review/links/0fcfd506d6effbeaa1000000.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vroomen and Keetels (2010)<\/a> describes various psychophysical studies that have examined what the <em>minimal asynchrony<\/em> is between two stimuli of different modality that lead to a synchronized percept. The following values are for simple stimuli, such as tactile taps, auditory beeps and visual flashes.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Auditory and tactile stimuli: <strong>80<\/strong> ms<\/li>\n<li>Auditory beeps and visual flashes: <strong>25 - 50<\/strong> ms<\/li>\n<li>Visual and tactile stimili: <strong>35 - 65<\/strong> ms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note that these lag differences are relatively large, given the speed of peripheral neural transduction (see the answer of poka.nandor). Moreover, the window of integration between more complex stimuli can be much greater. For example, the window for <strong>speech and visual information<\/strong> can be as large as <strong>203 ms<\/strong>.  Such large windows of integration point toward higher processes playing a role in the brain.\nNote that only temporal lags <strong>below 20 msec<\/strong> are expected to go <strong>unnoticed because of hard-wired limitations<\/strong> on the resolution power of the individual senses,<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Vroomen/publication/43535149_Perception_of_intersensory_synchrony_a_tutorial_review/links/0fcfd506d6effbeaa1000000.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vroomen and Keetels (2010)<\/a> argue there must be <strong>higher processes<\/strong> at work in the brain that actively synchronize percepts that are offset in time, but seem to belong to one and the same event. One such mechanism is referred to as <em>temporal ventriloquism<\/em>, which means that one perceptual modality is actively shifted in time to match it with another. This effect is most pronounced in visual stimuli, in that a visual percept is actively adjusted in time to match a sound or tactile stimulus.

Then, we tended to consider that sexual selection is part of natural selection. The part of natural selection that is not attributed to sexual selection is sometimes called ecological selection. Today, our understanding of these mechanisms brought us to consider the meaning of these words slightly differently. <\/p>\n\n<p>Natural selection is not anymore the result of a struggle for survival. It is any process yielding to a change in allele frequency through a long-enough term difference in fitness. Fitness is a index of how much an individual, a gene or whatever, leave copies of itself after a long and short enough amount of time (one might not agree with this definition I guess). Take two strains of bacteria in two petri dish, consider they are one population and let the bacteria grow. One strain will grow faster and the allele frequency will vary over time. It is the result of natural selection although there were no competition, no struggle at all given that they were not in contact.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that involves sexual competition. There are two types of sexual competition, the so-called inter- and intra-sexual competition. Inter-sexual competition means that one sex chose the other one, while for intra-sexual there is no choice from the other sex. For example, if you see two animals fighting, they either fight to have the physical acces to the other sex (intra-) or they fight and then, let the female decide which one is the best to mate with (inter-). These two concept of intra- and inter-sexual competition might somehow overlap in some specific case. I would argue that the concept of sexual competition and therefore of sexual selection have never been accurately defined. Therefore, I would not complain if one prefers to give up the concept of sexual selection to use only the concept of natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many articles state that sexual and natural selection act on a trait with the same or opposite directions. Given the above argumentations, you could as well say that there are two different forces of natural selection. if the trait is at state 'A', then the individual is very attractive to the other sex but is likely to not be able to escape a predator. This is the case of most of the trait we think of when talking about trait evolving through sexual selection.

Perhaps a more accurate and comprehensive term is \"reproductive selection\".  This would include \"sexual selection (eg qualities making an individual more attractive to the opposite sex) and \"survival selection\" - to the extent that survival allows one to produce more offspring.  (Dead organisms don't tend to reproduce).  Reproductive selection would correctly exclude fitness traits promoting post-reproductive survival that did not contribute to the reproductive success of progeny, eg a longer lifespan spent away from mates or offspring.  Reproductive selection would apply to a range of replicative mechanisms,  spanning sexual, asexual, mitotic and even possible early-stage RNA-strand replication.  It would also include both natural and artificial selection.  Finally, it has the advantage of being a more intuitive term that IMHO gets more at the core principle driving this aspect of evolution (as opposed to genetic drift, etc).  Not sure if this term is in common usage.

Because it has been unanswered for quite a while I will try to formulate an answer that may provide an approximate value for the minimal asynchrony perceivable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The temporal resolution of the visual system can be quantified in a number of ways. As you are referring to relatively simple stimuli, the <strong><em>critical flicker fusion frequency<\/em><\/strong> is probably the most relevant. At a certain critical frequency, a flickering stimulus will appear as a continuous stimulus. For example, the good old CRT screens can sometimes seem to be flickering. The mains is 50 Hz (US) or 60 Hz (Europe, Australia), and indeed the critical flicker fusion frequency is <strong>5 - 50 Hz<\/strong>, dependent on the lighting conditions (<a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/temporal-resolution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalloniatis &amp; Luu<\/a>). Hence, stimuli separated by <strong>200 ms<\/strong> (low lighting) to <strong>20 ms<\/strong> (high lighting conditions) can be temporally resolved. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am aware that your question is different, as you ask whether two stimuli on the retina can be perceived as being asycnchronous. Flicker fusion testing is mainly done with flash stimuli, i.e., a single stimulus per image, not two. However, from the various measures of temporal resolution of the visual system that have been used to date, the critical flicker fusion has the most conservative value, in that it provides the top-value of temporal resolution. Higher-level processing is much slower and values of around 4 Hz are obtained. For example, when subjects are tested on a stimulus of dots that are white when moving right and black when moving left, and they change directions/colors at a certain frequency, it becomes hard to tell whether the color change and direction change are synchronized at alteration rates of ~5 Hz and higher (<a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/temporal-resolution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalloniatis &amp; Luu<\/a>).    <\/p>\n\n<p>As to your question what the <strong>percentage chance<\/strong> is that stimuli separate by 20 -200 ms are separable, I can say that in general, psychophysical procedures determine the <em>threshold<\/em> defined as <em>halfway between chance and 100% correct<\/em>. Assuming a typical yes/no tasK (<em>are the traffic lights synchronous yes/no?<\/em>), chance would be 50% (guessing), and threshold would thus be defined as halfway between 50% and 100%, i.e., <strong>75% correct<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n- <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psych.usyd.edu.au%2Fstaff%2Falexh%2Fresearch%2Fpapers%2FHolcombe2009SeeingSlowSeeingFast.pdf&amp;ei=QCY6VbncF6WymAXQmYDYCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNERIIX0uIfi4eL9EPaqinVUIS15pg&amp;sig2=r-G-hCZqXp6sfsZopcDrzA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Holcomb, <em>Trends Cog Sci 2009<\/em>; <strong>13<\/strong>(5): 216-21<\/a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/temporal-resolution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalloniatis &amp; Luu, WebVision, chapter \"Temporal Resolution\" 2007<\/a>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":31677,"question_id":13884,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1429960238}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13884/how-well-do-we-notice-asynchronicity","last_activity_date":1429960238,"creation_date":1386564865,"answer_count":1,"title":"How well do we notice asynchronicity?","body":"<p>I'm stopped at a stoplight and, with nothing to do, my thoughts wander to the timed don't-walk sign that governs any pedestrians who might wish to cross the street I'm driving along. <\/p>\n\n<p>I can see two such signs, one on my side of the cross street, and one across the way.

The fitness of an individual which cooperate is by definition $w_o + b - c$ (note the letters are not capitalized). If you cooperate and the other don't, your fitness is $w_o - c$. If you don't cooperate and the other does cooperate, you fitness is $w_o + b$. If nobody cooperates, your fitness if $w_o$. And by definition , $b&gt;c$. Knowing the frequency of people that cooperate in the population $y$ and knowing and your probability of cooperating is $x$. Then, the level of altruism (frequency of cooperations) increases in the population if and only if <\/p>\n\n<p>$$R\\cdot\\frac{dw(x,y)}{dx}&gt;\\frac{dw(x,y)}{dy}$$, where $R$ is the coefficient of relatedness which can itself be expressed as a correlation between the variables $x$ and $y$. $w(x,y)$ is the fitness of the the individual being altruistic with probability $x$ in a population where individuals cooperate with probability $y$ and $\\frac{dw(x,y)}{dx}$ is the partial derivative of the fitness function with respect to $x$. By definition, $\\frac{dw(x,y)}{dx} = B$ and $\\frac{dw(x,y)}{dy}=C$ (capital letters).<\/p>\n\n<p>The mean fitness of the population therefore depends on the frequency of cooperation $y$. Let's assume for simplicity that $y=1$ (equilibrium), then the mean fitness of the population is $w_o + b - c$ (note that the letters, $b$ and $c$ are not capital letter), and the variance in fitness is null. All individuals has a fitness of $w_o + b -c$ as all individuals are altruistic and perform action that has a negative impact on the fitness $-c$ and a positive impact on their fitness $b$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In short<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>$b$ and $c$ in your question, correspond to $b$ and $c$ in my answer and not to $B$ and $C$. If you're playing prisoner's dilemna, then by definition, if everybody cooperate (no variance in the population), then everybody has a fitness of $w_o + b - c$ and the mean fitness is $w_0 + b - c$ (as there is no variance). Now the question of whether everybody ends up cooperating depends on $B$, $C$ and $R$.<\/p>\n\n<p>In your edit, you write $rb$ and $c$ but you get confused about the meaning of $b$ and $c$. If you are playing prisoner's dilemna, when you cooperate with someone that is also cooperating, you inclusive fitness is $b-c + r(b-c)$ and if you cooperate with someone that is not cooperating, your inclusive fitness is $b-c + r(b)$.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31683,"question_id":31611,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1429920844}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31611/modeling-inclusive-fitness","last_activity_date":1429920844,"creation_date":1429727161,"answer_count":1,"title":"Modeling inclusive fitness","body":"<p>Consider a population of two altruist with coefficient of relatedness\n$r$.

It should be stressed that while this is true for the population, it is not for individual plasmids-these are selected randomly for replication. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dRlr0.png\" alt=\"fig1\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So not all plasmid copies are replicated once per cell cycle rather random ones are selected and they replicate to maintain the desired number.\nWhen your plasmid has reached its target copy number it will adjust its replication frequency to maintain this number. This is achieved by negative control loops. There are many ways to do this (repressor proteins, anti-sense RNA) or in your case iterons. These sequence along with the rep protein may inhibit replication if too much plasmid is present by a phenomenon called  \u201csteric hindrance\" or \u201chandcuffing\u201d. This happens because the rep protein is capable to bind two iteron, simultaneously. \nAt low copy numbers saturation of iteron sequences by rep proteins initiate replication, but at high copy number rep proteins tend to interact with each other and plasmids pair up through rep-rep interactions therefore cannot replicate. See figure below:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RhIuI.png\" alt=\"rep handcuffing\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So, long story short: plasmid replication in part depends on host factors but plasmids have means to control their copy number, and once target has been reached they maintain this number in a stable form. I know this answer does not provide solution to the when part of your question, but it provides an answer to the practical part of your problem namely: plasmid numbers are quite stable after the target number has been reached. I hope this helps<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I've found this article <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC210920/pdf/jbacter00181-0364.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC210920/pdf/jbacter00181-0364.pdf<\/a> that says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In all experiments, plasmids pSG21 (oriS only), F'lac (oriS oriV),pBR322,\n  and pSC101 were capable of replicating at all stages of the division cycle,\n  with no detectable differences in the patterns.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So bad news for you, because according to the paper above you cannot tell when your plasmid actually replicates. Yet still as the average copy number is quite stable due to reasons described above this may not pose a big problem. Keep in mind even if you have an extra plasmid for a short time that may still not cause problem, because transcription of your riporter gene, folding, etc takes time under which previously synthesized proteins might degrade.<\/p>\n\n<p>However <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC207836/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> paper says the F+ plasmid replication is cell-cycle specific, you may wan to give it a try.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31640,"question_id":31625,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1429892011}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31625/when-do-plasmids-replicate-relative-to-its-host-cell-cycle","last_activity_date":1429892011,"creation_date":1429750366,"answer_count":1,"title":"When do plasmids replicate relative to its host cell cycle?","body":"<p>For plasmids is so much shorter than their host cell's genome (about 1/1000 in my case), it will take only 1/1000 time for it to replicate. <\/p>\n\n<p>With respect to cell cycle, when will that replication occur?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Description of the situation I'm facing: <\/p>\n\n<p>I have a low copy number plasmids (pSC101) in E.coli, and I'm measuring a fluorescence protein expression level.

The combined effect of the brain cooling system\n  keeps the temperature inside the vault and brain about two to three\n  degrees cooler than the rest of the body. The effect is important\n  enough that some physical anthropologists attribute the extra-large\n  size of the human brain more to its exceptional cooling capacity than\n  to the increase in arterial blood flow that comes with upright\n  posture. Anthropologists refer to human encephalization due to\n  enhanced brain cooling capacity as the \"radiator theory\".\n  <a href=\"http://www.upright-health.com/brain-cooling.html+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also yawning and panting are considered to be mechanisms to reduce brain temperature.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31673,"question_id":31566,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31566/how-does-the-brain-cool-itself","last_activity_date":1429848981,"creation_date":1429632087,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does the brain cool itself?","body":"<p>Thoughout life everyone tells you that brain is essentially a computer but just like computers your brain would create immense amounts of heat by being in use, so if that's the case how does it cool down.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is like liquid cooling where the blood transfers the heat away? and if so what is the critical temperature when your blood can no longer cool your brain?

That is, you may see it is day light when your body is under the impression it is evening. Your circadian clock is controlled by your master clock located in the hypothalamus. As you take in these external inputs that counter your circadian clock, a group of nerve cells called the suprachiasmagic nucleus will slowly make the master clock adjustment <a href=\"http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Education/Pages/Factsheet_CircadianRhythms.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a>.
