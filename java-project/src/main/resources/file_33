Another set of switches contain signature sequences that\n  are recognized by Hox proteins and that control how other genes are\n  expressed in different modules.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In both arthropods and vertebrates, the Hox genes are developed in\n  zones along the main body axis. The distinct zones of each Hox gene's\n  expression domain are governed by genetic switches, and seperate\n  switches control Hox gene patterns in different tissues such as the\n  ...... Because of the logic of the genetic switches, the cells that\n  belong to one module express different Hox proteins or combinations of\n  Hox proteins than those in adjacent modules....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Let us take an example of Ubx gene which leads to formation of wings in the 2nd and 3rd thoracic segments of  drosophila. This gene is turned off in the first thoracic segment  but in the second and third segments, it is turned on. This regulation can be achieved because of the genetic switches which in turn can be switched on or off by activators and repressors. These activators and repressors are unevenly distributed in the embryo and so regulation of switches in different parts of the embryo is possible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13930,"question_id":13808,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1389609159},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ee6021a546a8004490b711614e52409?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":866,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/866/john","reputation":214,"display_name":"John","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":13940,"edited":false,"creation_date":1386867222,"comment_id":18228,"body":"Great, this is what I was looking for!

However, I think the best one can do is to look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki article for experimental evolution<\/a> who already offer quite an interesting list of examples.

I think I don't need to list and make extensive description of how artificial selection has changed their phenotypes (and genotypes). Consider the pigs, banana and corn as examples.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A few evolved features that has evolved in labs in small organisms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We have observed evolution of multicellularity form unicellular organisms, observed new metabolic pathways and change in ploidy level just to cite a few major things that we evolved.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lenski experiments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Lenski long term experiments is the longest in lab evolution experiment performed today. They made a lot of different observations and not only the case of citric acid metabolization that you mention. Note that being able to metabolize a new compound is a pretty considerable evolved feature that only those who can't go further than considering evolution of extra legs as something significant would fail to appreciate.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Drosophila and Waddington's experiment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If one must restrict I suppose that looking at experimental evolution on Drosophila would be our best bet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Change in allele frequency through selection is a relatively fast process. Creation of beneficial variants through mutations is often the limiting process. Cases where very different phenotypes exist in natural population and selection over these phenotypes (change in frequency only) will probably not be considered to be \"impressive enough\". However, one can consider Waddington's experiments (and further experiments inspired by Waddington's work) as an example of experimental evolution where standing genetic variance existed before the experiment started but was hidden in the environment they experimented (the exact process here might well be too advanced for a layman). Waddington in his experiments showed one can evolve Drosophila to have a double thorax or lose their halteres in only 20 generations.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Drosophila experiments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We evolved Drosophila to live in hypoxic conditions. It took about 200 generations that is more than 4 years. We have also selected Drosophila for cognitive abilities and food preference (and many other things).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note on the term \"macro-evolution\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The term \"macro-evolution\" hasn't been invented by creationists. It has been invented a long time ago, in 1927 by a russian entomologist. T. Dobzhanski and E. Mayr (two famous evolutionary biologist) have used this term without ever quite defining it. Because the term was never correctly defined, the vast majority of evolutionary biologist have either criticized the term.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is true that the term is now sometimes used by creationist as any poorly defined term is one of the finest solution to build questions that can't be properly addressed due its lack of clarity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39716,"question_id":39711,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1445149696}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39711/have-there-been-any-macro-evolution-experiements","last_activity_date":1445149696,"creation_date":1445112749,"answer_count":1,"title":"Have there been any macro-evolution experiements?","body":"<p>I'd like to start first by saying that I don't believe in creationism at all, nor any non-Darwinian-evolution explanation of the diversity of life on Earth.

Computational chem and bio have been working on this problem with mixed success.  The summary of what I'm going to say here is that when you try to calculate the differences in entropy (or energy for that matter), <a href=\"http://modem.ucsd.edu/html/publications/MMPBSA_review.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Gibbs Free Energy differences in most biological processes such as enzyme/substrate binding, protein/protein or protein/DNA interactions or protein folding etc is so small compared to the errors in these calculations that the computations are hard to believe<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Entropy is ultimately a term one would use in calculating the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gibb's free energy<\/a> which will tell whether a given chemical or molecular process will occur.  So it's a valuable number to have.  Gibbs Free Energy (G) equals Enthalpy (heat) minus the temperature (T) times the change in entropy. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>G<\/em> = H - T$\\Delta$S<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://entropysite.oxy.edu/wiki_entropy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Entropic term<\/a>, $\\Delta$S is described in chemical systems often as a change in the combinatorial change of the system and the change in the heat capacity of the system. The first of these could broadly described as a 'mixing' term.  When more than one solvents or a solvent and a solute diffuse into each other mix completely, the number of possible states is maximized.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The heat capacity of the system is a more often the focus of entropy calculations for proteins and biological molecules.  This is because the conformations of the biological molecules, especially how free they are to move around are thought to contribute to the entropic part of <em>G<\/em>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So attempts have been made to estimate from NMR and crystallography as well as molecular dynamics how much domains and side chains are free to move.  Unfortunately this is only an insufficient proxy for biological entropy.  A substantial if not dominant contribution to the <em>T$\\Delta$S<\/em> term comes from <em>solvent<\/em>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>How is this so?  Water molecules form structures around proteins which are not static, but do involve many water molecules residing there on the average to see them in crystal structures and NMR experiments.  While the individual waters are exchanging rapidly, they are not in the same entropic state in water solution as they are when they form a hydration shell around an aromatic or charged side chain.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Attempts have been made to parametrize the solvent entropy by looking at the buried nonpolar surface in a folded protein, looking at the mobility of sidechains before and after folding/binding, but these metrics appear to be configuration dependent to the point that they can't calculate the protein entropy via these efforts, at least heretofore. <\/p>\n\n<p>Conventionally, molecular dynamics tries to calculate this by surrounding the proteins or other molecules with water molecules and some approximation of the overall entropy is calculated on the entire system.  It turns out that small differences between the water molecular models and the simplifications in ball and stick/Hooke potential water models we make are also problematic approximations when there are hundreds or thousands of water molecules in the simulation. <\/p>\n","answer_id":10190,"question_id":10186,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1378075117}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10186/how-to-calculate-or-know-by-experiment-the-entropy-of-enzymes-or-protein","last_activity_date":1445133327,"creation_date":1378041903,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to calculate or know by experiment the entropy of enzymes or protein?","body":"<p>How do you calculate or experimentally determine the entropy of enzymes or protein?

I have done some research on the topic and found so much interesting information. It still seems like a topic that i being researched on, but so far, the research shows that malate is created by a CAM and C4 like pathway while citrate is created from TCA cycle.  Their functions are that they are important biomolecules in metabolism, in particular respiration.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Malic acid and citric acid are the two main organic acids that are accumulated in the fruits and cause the sour taste. Citrus fruits contain more citric acid and other fruits like apples and pears contain malic acid. I will provide a detailed analysis for both cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>In an article by <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/236/9/2377.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deshpande &amp; Ramakrishnan<\/a> they mention two hypotheses about the accumulation of the citric acid in fruits. One was that the organic acids are not formed in the fruit, but transported to the fruit, in which the fruit acts like a storage organ. The other hypothesis is that the carbohydrates in the fruit is converted to the organic acid. In their research. they tried to isolate some enzymes from the Garcinia fruit to support the second hypothesis. They say:<\/p>\n\n<p>This [reciprocal relation between acid and sugar content] would indicate the transformation of sugar to citric acid in the fruit tissue itself due to the presence of the requisite enzyme systems.\nThey suggest that the TCA cycle is how the citric acid is being accumulated and stored.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/6/1471.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">article in the comments by Lobit et al.<\/a> also supports a similar hypothesis of the accumulation of malic acid. The authors tell us that the malic acid is most likely produced in the fruit itself because the pH of the xylem and phloem (the transporting organs of plants) have a pH of close to 7 or higher. It seems that the malic acid is stored in the vacuoles of the mesocarp cells and that the amount of malic acid in the fruit depends on the transport of the malic acid to the vacuoles in the mesocarp cells.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The actual pathways for the creation of citric acid and malic acid are very complex. Here is a picture of the different pathways in the cytosol of the mesocarp cells thst create these organic acids (picture taken from Etienne et al.) <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIP5h.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIP5h.jpg\" alt=\"Organic acid creation pathways in the mesocarp cells\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The first pathway described is the PEP pathway, which is really a modified CAM or C4 pathway (which are teo ways to deal with photorespiratin, and are adaptations to hot, dry environments). The PEP is converted to oxaloacetate by PEPC, which also takes in CO2, then that oxaloacetate is converted to malate by NAD-MDH. PEPC is regulated by malate concentration and cystolic pH, showing that the activity of PEPC is to indirectly increase the malate concentrations, not just to create more oxaloacetate.Let me note that I still don't fully understand why C4 and CAM-like pathways are present in Fruits from C3 plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>The major pathway for citrate synthesis is the TCA cycle. Both are also involved in metabolism. TCA cycle (the citric acid cycle) is an important cycle and the second pathway in aerobic respiration. This pathway occurs in the mitochondria. Malate reacts with acetyl-CoA to make citrate and the CoA is released. The citrate then goes on to be repeatedly oxidized and ends up back to oxaloacetate. Now, for metabolic reasons, for example, if the amount of ATP created is top much at the end of aerobic respiration, the citrate could be transported out of the mitochondria, leading to citrate accumulation. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Control of acid accumulation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The control of the organic acid accumulation is different for both malic acid and citric acid. Malic acid accumulation in the vacuoles is controlled by vacuolar storage and vacuolar transport (Etienne et al). This hypothesis was really the subject of the article in the comments. Their article was about modeling the malic acid based on this hypothesis and compare it to actual biochemical analysis of fruits. Their results supported the hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>The accumulation of citric acid is more dependent on metabolism, therefore respiration. This is since the vacuolar transport is slower for citrate than malate, and so whatever limits thr speed of malate vauolar transport affects citrate. But citrate concentration in thr cytosol would be the only other main factor affecting the vacuolar transport. A model by <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/10/2583.abstract?ijkey=c62e9067d945458ff5332bc1f25879c7627966ac&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wu et al.<\/a> was created based on this hypothesis and compared to the actual citrate concentrations, and once again, this hypothesis also supported.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Functions of these organic acids<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Suprisingly, the only functions of malate and citric acid cycle is mainly for respiration(mainly TCA cycle), and other metabolic processes. Malate does affect the texture, ripening, and starch metabolism and more of fruits, as described in <a href=\"http://www.plantcell.org/content/23/1/162.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a>.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an important means of treating liver cancer. Residual cancer after RFA is the most frequent cause of recurrence in cases of liver cancer. The main difference between residual cancer cells and ordinary liver cancer cells is that residual cancer cells experience heat shock. The secretable form of trimeric human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (stTRAIL) induces apoptosis in a variety of human cancers but not in normal tissues. It has shown potent cancer-selective killing activity and has drawn considerable attention as a possible cancer therapy. In the present work, the therapeutic potential of this stTRAIL-based gene therapy was evaluated in hepatocellular carcinoma subjected to RFA. Rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were isolated and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding stTRAIL (stTRAIL-MSCs, T-MSCs). Cells treated with heat treatment at 43\u2009°C for 45\u2009min served as simulated residual cancer cells. After treatment with T-MSCs, apoptosis in heat-shock-treated liver cancer cells increased significantly, and caspase-3 was upregulated. When T-MSCs were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, they localized to the tumors and inhibited tumor growth, significantly increasing survival. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that BM-MSC can provide a steady source of stTRAIL and may be suitable for use in the prevention of the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after RFA with secretable trimeric TRAIL.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":16955,"question_id":16952,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1398698391},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFOJq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17491,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17491/roger-l","reputation":114,"display_name":"Roger L."},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef69e4c7ba6adf44fc3d17c4bbacec01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10401,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10401/tanmath","reputation":1620,"display_name":"TanMath","accept_rate":58},"score":0,"post_id":39593,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444875186,"comment_id":66382,"body":"Can you provide evidence for your claims"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFOJq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17491,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17491/roger-l","reputation":114,"display_name":"Roger L."},"score":0,"post_id":39593,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef69e4c7ba6adf44fc3d17c4bbacec01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10401,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10401/tanmath","reputation":1620,"display_name":"TanMath","accept_rate":58},"edited":false,"creation_date":1445012984,"comment_id":66478,"body":"Which one of saying you wanna me to provide the evidence...?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef69e4c7ba6adf44fc3d17c4bbacec01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10401,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10401/tanmath","reputation":1620,"display_name":"TanMath","accept_rate":58},"score":0,"post_id":39593,"edited":false,"creation_date":1445018543,"comment_id":66481,"body":"I am, and looks like some other people agree with me..."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1444870430,"creation_date":1444870430,"body":"<p>Using beams of microwaves, this idea is good.

During this time the average height of Swedish men (aged between 18-21) increased from 167.4 cm (in 1841-45) to 180.2 (in 2004), an increase of 12.8 cm or 7.6% (<a href=\"http://pediatrisk-endokrinologi.no/2008/1/Werner_2008_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Werner. 2008.

This is clearly not due to changes in the genetics of the population, but to changes in the environment (probably mainly due to nutrition). I know that many countries have gone through a similar development, and this is usually refered to as a secular change or trend in body height and weight (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/503084\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Roche. 1979. Secular trends in human growth, maturation, and development.

However, it shows that the average height in two countries cannot be compared in a meaningful way (at least if you want to infer genetic differences) without knowing something about the nutrition status and the average living conditions in both countries. The situation is rather that genetics is setting the limits of potential height, but that environmental factors will determine the actual outcome. This is also discussed in the paper above, but there are certainly better references to be found in English.

However, in my eyes this is too restrictive. Also note that the main use of 'hunting' is in reference to hunting by humans, and some of these hunting methods mimic the sit-and-wait strategies of reptiles (see e.g. some methods for big game hunting and the use of traps).

These organisms have some mechanisms other than the cytoplasmic organization that allows them to cope up with injuries:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When the outer membrane ruptures, then the cytoplasm contracts with the help of actin filaments that are attached to the former. Subsequently the membrane fuses, protoplasts form and then cell wall is regenerated. This movement is likely to be triggered by extracellular calcium.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A single cytoplasmic domain with nucleus and other essential organelles can regenerate an entire organism. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A muclilagenous layer made up of sulphated polysaccharides coats both the vacuolar and extracellular surfaces. During injury it impedes the movement of water and ions (by retaining them in the form of a gel) and therefore acts like a plug.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Other organisms like this (siphonous algae) also have similar mechanisms.

Here is my basic understanding so far, that I am not 100% certain is accurate. I am not a biologist - I just communicate with them, so I do not need any confusing assay names/specifications that are important only for wet lab biologists.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Steps:\n1. Collect blood from patient. \n2. Purify DNA by isolating DNA \n            (Procedure (?): lyse/sonicate, bind using ethanol, centrifuge, \n            wash with buffer, centrifuge again, rinse with water, centrifuge \n            again)\n3. Cut DNA into 100-150 bp read fragments \n            (Procedure (?): with restriction enzymes? how do you determine \n            read length with restriction enzymes?)\n4. Separate double stranded reads into single stranded reads \n            (Procedure (?): denature with heat) \n5. Amplify reads via PCR, leaving you with many single stranded reads\n6. Disperse sample evenly into all cells on a BeadChip. The BeadChip \n      contains bountiful DNA polymerase and fluorescently tagged single nucleotides. \n7. Submit the BeadChip to the Next Generation Sequencer for processing.\n8. You end up with a BUNCH of images which you can transcribe into sequences \n      based on the color illuminated in each photo capture, in each position \n      on the BeadChip.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Here's what doesn't make sense to me:\nStep 6. You either have to only put one PCR read product in each cell at a time - which would take FOREVER, if you wanted to sequence someone's whole genome... Or you have more than one light going off per <em>cell<\/em>, per BeadChip, in each photo. If the latter is the case (which it would have to be for high throughput wet lab experiments), how do you determine between photo captures <em>of a given cell in a BeadChip<\/em> that the nucleotide going off in photo 2 is a part of fragment n or n+k?<\/p>\n\n<p>Does this make sense? Basically, how are BeadChips loaded with sample reads for NGS genotyping? I know that reads are \"anchored\", but are they anchored in each cell of the BeadChip? This is the only way this makes sense to me.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any insights!<\/p>\n","question_id":39587,"tags":["dna-sequencing","genomics","microarray","methods"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e03150dbc44d1c7e030810632076b98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19042,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19042/r-s","reputation":8,"display_name":"R S"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/adf92108995357b060d2595aa779c1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14970,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14970/gerhard","reputation":287,"display_name":"Gerhard"},"score":2,"post_id":39444,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444506891,"comment_id":66067,"body":"Could you add where you have gotten this advice?

You will note a few interesting exceptions to the rule though, including <em>Homo sapiens<\/em>, where the female keep living relatively long after her reproductive age. Of course, modern medicine is part of the explanation but we tend to think that modern medicine alone is not sufficient.

Finally there are semelparous <em>plants<\/em> (some agave and some bamboos).

It is interesting to note that the survival cost to the microorganism in the evolution of drug resistance is high as it is highly dependent on the environment in which it happens to exist momentarily. One could envision that in the case of a plasmid-borne resistance factor, the organism must synthesise the additional genetic material and the protein that it encodes. However, this energy cost factor may be affected by the nutritional limits of the environment in which the organism finds itself. Furthermore, alterations of chromosomal genes encoding the targets for antibacterials may present the opportunity for the selection of resistance to antibiotics. However, such modifications may jeopardise the normal function of the gene products and make the organism that carries them less fit in the wild, or diminish or lose the capacity to survive in the absence of the antibiotic. Numerous studies indicate that genetic adaptation by secondary mutations elsewhere in the genome and natural selection reduces this \u2018cost\u2019 to the organism in several generations of growth, such that the cost is either reduced or eliminated entirely. Indeed, recent studies suggest that a progression of bacterial resistance to given noxious agents involves a sequence mechanism that renders the organism increasingly resistant to the agent, but nevertheless at a cost to its survival fitness<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>-Martins, A., Spengler, G., Molnár, J. and Amaral, L. 2014. Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance. eLS. <\/p>\n\n<p>In order to truly grant resistance to an antibiotic, the bacterium needs to be expressing the enzyme the confers resistance constitutively so that it can react to the antibiotic when the cell comes in contact with the antibiotic. If the bacterium has to wait until it encounters the antibiotic to start expressing the resistance gene, then the bacterium will likely be killed before it has a chance to produce the protein that will protect it. This is especially true for antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosomes to prevent protein synthesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>The result is that the bacterium has to use energy to produce the enzyme. It also has to maintain that gene either on a plasmid or incorporated in a very small genome. That again means the resistant cell needs more energy for replication, and likely a bit more time to divide. That may seem trivial, but if the nonresistants can divide every 20 minutes while it might take the resistants 25 or 30 minutes, the resistant bacteria will be out competed by the nonresistant bacteria, for the simple fact that the nonresistants are using less energy to survive and replicate and they are doing it faster, so the will have more descendants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing that you need to realize is that a lot of times the use of antibiotics only holds a bacterial infection in check until our adaptive immune system can be raised and respond to the infection. So not completing a course of antibiotics means that during the period of time that the antibiotic was used the resistant bacteria had a growth advantage over the nonresistant bacteria. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you stop taking the antibiotic before the immune system can clear the infection completely, then both types of bacteria will begin to divide again, and there will be more of the resistant bacteria than there will be nonresistant, so they will contribute more descendants to the reemerging infection. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another problem is that the more resistant bacteria there are the more of a chance there is that they can pass on that resistance gene to bacteria that didn't have it before. Now when you go back on the antibiotic, less and less of the bacteria in the infection will be affected, and you will get uncontrolled growth of the infection. There is a point where your immune system either is overwhelmed and cannot respond, the toxicity level from endo and exo toxins produced by the bacteria makes you very sick, or your immune response responds too strongly and does significant damage to your own tissue trying to fight off the bacteria.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39458,"question_id":39454,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1444635459}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39454/how-do-antibiotics-create-drug-resistant-strains","last_activity_date":1444682294,"creation_date":1444531875,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do antibiotics create drug-resistant strains","body":"<p>I've heard for years that low-level use of antibiotics causes the spread of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, but the explanations always fall short.

Therefore, to excite an electron to a higher energy level the energy of the incident light should match the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state. <\/p>\n\n<p>In a molecule, there are different electrons, that reside in different orbitals and environments; only a few electrons can be exited by the energy that UV-Visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum can provide. These electrons are typically referred to as chromophores. You should refer to a book on spectroscopy for more details. A molecule can have multiple chromophores and each may absorb a different wavelength. <\/p>\n\n<p>Having said that, there are energy bands (multiple closely spaced energy levels) in the <strong>molecule<\/strong> instead of fixed energy state which allows absorption in a range of wavelengths around a value at which the absorption is maximum.
