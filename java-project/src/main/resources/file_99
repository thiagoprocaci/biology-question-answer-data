It's an interesting question, but I think it's important to remember that evolution doesn't act on the two sexes separately. Sterile males might evolve and be maintained simply because they're good for their sisters or mothers. Sometimes genes that are advantageous for one sex are linked with genes that are disadvantageous for the other sex, leading to maladaptative traits in one sex. And of course, individuals don't necessarily forego opportunities willingly. If subordinates that attempt to mate are killed by the dominant individuals, then that trait is not advantageous. They'd be better advised to be altruistic and help their relatives, rather than be selfish and be killed (thereby depriving their colony of a worker). This would lead to selection for sterility.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting that while haploidy makes it easier for kin selection to evolve by increasing relatedness, it's not crucial.

In a multicellular sexual organism, this \"shared fate\" of the \"group\" is the shared prospect that all replicators (alleles) have for making it into the next generation via the meotic lottery that produces the gamete.  Since they share this prospective fate they have an evolutionary incentive to cooperate in the construction of specialized cells that are, in effect, \"sterile caste\" members of the total \"hive\".  Similarly, if it is possible to subject all members of a group of individuals to a shared fate through multiple generations -- they will tend to evolve highly cooperative social structures.  However, one of the confusing aspects of the eusocial insect colonies is whether they evolved to be that way through shared fate of individual organisms, or some variant on the meotic lottery's shared fate of alleles.  The answer appears to be, primarily, that it is a peculiar form of meotic lottery in which the genes of the parents have extended phenotypes in the children that, in essence, parasitically castrate the vast majority of the children to help rear more offspring for the parents -- in particular the queen.  In this respect, one can view the evolution of eusociality in the social insects as a perverse form of individual selection where the genes of, say, the queen, cooperate in constructing not just the queen's body but, also, the entire hive.  The sterile castes are simply extended phenotypes of the queen (and the  drone with which she mates).<\/p>\n\n<p>See \"The Social Conquest of Earth\" by E. O.

Modern humans, throughout recorded history, rarely broke the 100-years-old mark. Our evolutionary cousins <a href=\"http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/chimpanzee\">rarely break half of that<\/a> and in the wild <a href=\"http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/apes/gorilla/\">reach old age at our \"Middle Age\" equivalent.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So, knowing that <em>as we are<\/em> is exceptionally long-lived for members of our clade, it would be absolutely incredible and far beyond expectations for an evolutionary ancestor to live <strong>8x-9x<\/strong> longer than some of the longest-lived members of our tree (and would be one of the longest living complex organisms <em>ever<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Impossible? No. We can only interpret data from the past; we do not have any records from the time period. In that way, you're entirely correct if you're looking for additional proof. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But does science have some other age proofs besides this?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This depends on what you consider 'other' proof. Most of the estimations of age of found fossils relies on comparative morphology: We assume that because our joints and teeth wear-out at a certain rate, we can compare the rate of decay of teeth and joints of fossils and get an estimate. If it's true that our extinct cousins experienced similar wear 'n tear as we do (and we <em>don't<\/em> have any reason to think otherwise; the bones may be slightly different, but they are made up of the same material), then we can use the comparative morphology as a reasonable estimate.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we assume that their bones and teeth wore out much, <em>much<\/em> slower (it would have to be about 10x slower while also being made of similar material) then our age estimates would have to be adjusted.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>May be, for example, from migration data or from some other sources?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Migration data would be incredibly difficult to produce. You would have to follow one family as they migrated, and fossils are rare enough as-is. Data like that would be practically impossible to gather.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps some Population Geneticist has run some genomic data and is capable of making a similar claim through the molecular clock hypothesis, but I am as-yet unaware of anything like this.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isn't it possible in principle, that some virus epidemic in ancient times cause humans to live shorter, due to virus DNA embedded into all of the human DNAs?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In principle? Yes. But there <strong>isn't<\/strong> any evidence for that. Keep in mind that in order for the viral DNA to be integrated into <em>all<\/em> of humanity then it would have had to infect us when our numbers were very, <em>very<\/em> small. Evidence does show a bottlenecking event in humans <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck#Humans\">about 70,000 years ago<\/a> - but this was thought to have been caused by a supervolcano eruption which dramatically changed the environment and <em>not<\/em> a virus. Both genomic and geological evidence come together to support that hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, while you are <em>correct<\/em> that - in <em>theory<\/em> a population of humans could have been infected by a virus which mutated their DNA and caused a dramatic reduction in lifespan at the same time as a bottlenecking event - we have no <em>other<\/em> evidence supporting that, either genomic, geological, or evolutionary. <\/p>\n\n<p>Given the <em>lack<\/em> of evidence, we should remember our <strong>Occam's Razor<\/strong> - In the absence of evidence, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.<\/p>\n\n<p>So it's either an <em>exceptionally<\/em> long-lived species of an already-long-living family contracted a virus at the same time a bottlenecking event occurred and didn't leave behind any evidence, <em>or<\/em> our ancestors lived about as long as our evolutionary cousins do now and it's <em>us<\/em> who are exceptionally long-lived because of evolutionarily advantageous things like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis\">The Grandmother Hypothesis<\/a> and advancements in technology - which is supported by genomic evidence, fossil evidence, geological evidence, and recorded history.<\/p>\n\n<p>We cannot ever <em>truly<\/em> know what happened several hundred thousand years ago.

You should then be able to simulate the time evolution of the system just by solving the (large) system of ODEs given your initial conditions.

High-temperature pasteurization or brief cooking - heating milk above 170°F/76°C - generates traces of many flavorful substances, including those characteristic of vanilla, almonds and cultured butter, as well as hydrogen sulfide. <strong>Prolonged boiling encourages browning or Maillard reactions between lactose and milk proteins<\/strong>, and generates molecules that combine to give the flavor of butterscotch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>He continues by speaking about the different types of pasteurization, and says (pg.22-23)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The third method of pasteurizing milk is the <em>ultra-high temperature<\/em> (UHT) method which involves heating milk at 265-300°F/130-150°C either instantaneously or for 1 to 3 seconds, and produces milk that, if packaged under strictly sterile conditions can be stored for months without refrigeration. The longer UHT treatment imparts a cooked flavor and slightly brown color to milk; cream contains less lactose and protein, so its color and flavor are less affected.<br>\n  Sterilized milk has been heated at 230-250°F/110-121°C for 8 to 30 minutes; it is even darker and stronger in flavor, and keeps indefinitely at room temperature.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it appears as if indeed there may be some Maillard reaction going on in UHT, although it is probably minor (otherwise the milk would be much darker in color, as it is the case for sterilized milk).<\/p>\n\n<p>The book also speaks about homogenization, but it does not mention anything specific about Maillard reaction there (homogenization is not carried on at high temperatures, so it does makes sense not to have it).<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer your question:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does this effect the nutritional value of the milk? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, according to this presentation (but, be warned, it does not cite any reference!) it seems that it does, although I don't think the Maillard reaction is specially involved.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Aslal_saja/effect-of-uht-treatment\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slideshare.net/Aslal_saja/effect-of-uht-treatment<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically it says that the irreversible changes that occur are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whey protein denaturation (35 to 100% of denaturation of $\\beta$-lactoglobulin)  <\/li>\n<li>Slight increase in the size of casein micelles  <\/li>\n<li>Whey protein-casein micelle interaction<\/li>\n<li>Maillard reactions<\/li>\n<li>Fat globule composition changes (although no changes in nutritional value of milk fat)<\/li>\n<li>Vitamin content changes (20-30% loss in vitamin B1 and B12. Markedly reduced content in vitamin C and folic acid if high level of oxygen were present during the treatment, no changes in vitamins A, D, E and beta-carotene). <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It also says that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Biological value and net protein utilization of UHT milk were lower for stored milk than directly used milk.

FRET linkers are a thing of tinkering, unfortunately. Förster resonance energy transfer, or FRET, is a phenomena that decays with $ 1/{r^6} $, the radius between the donor and acceptor. When constructing FRET reporters, there are a few things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length of linker<\/strong>. The length of the linker (including any cleavage sites), follows an concave optimization curve. A linker too long (> 18 amino acids) or too short (&lt; 5 amino acids) and the FRET signal rapidly diminishes. When considering a FRET reporter in which no cleavage site is introduced, I've seen reporter an optimal linker length of 7-8 amino acids. When including a cleavage site, I've seen optimal liker lengths reporter of 18 amino acids. TO my knowledge, there is no theoretical way to predict the FRET efficiency based on linker sequence, and from scientists I've talked to, they conduct a trial-and-error approach using purified protein products to screen for an optimal length if it appears necessary to do so.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of FRET reporter<\/strong>. Cleavable FRET reporters fall into two classes. Positive reporters, in which signal appears after cleavage, must use longer linkers to separate fluorophores enough to reduce the FRET phenomenon. Negative reporter, in which FRET signal is lost after cleavage, must necessarily employ both short cleavage sites and linkers, to maximize the FRET phenomenon prior to cleavage. Since you mention the cleavage site itself is 15-18 AA, I would certainly expect very little FRET when uncleaved, assuming that the linker and cleavage site are unstructured, as the distance between the two fluorophores is quite large for the FRET phenomenon. Alternatively, intramolecular FRET reporters are usually designed as positive FRET controls, using short linkers to maximize the FRET phenomenon. When tagging two proteins seperately for FRET, short linkers are also chosen, relying on some external interaction to bring them together, however, this requires a lot of optimization of linker length for both fluorophores for maximum efficiency.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Choice of linker amino acids<\/strong>. This part here is somewhat subjective. The choice I often see in the literature are the tiny and small amino acids (especially Ser, Ala and Gly). The choice of these is mostly because they will likely have the least interaction among the linker structure and adjoining proteins and will be the most flexible. The linker should be chosen to avoid use of putative sites for modification (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation), rigid geometry (Pro, or bulky aromatics) and excessive charged amino acids.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I should note that I have found no comprehensive review of these three parameters for FRET construct design, and I have gleaned them from the literature. In my opinion, linker length is more critical to optimize than its amino acid sequence, provided that the linker does not lend itself to stable/rigid geometry and modification.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would also suggest seeing if FRET constructs have been made using your cleavage site of interest already, and perhaps use the same linking sequences. From this, you could construct a slightly shorter and longer construct to see if one is more optimal over the other.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10765,"question_id":10764,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10764/is-there-an-optimal-composition-and-length-for-protein-linkers-in-fret","last_activity_date":1382976429,"creation_date":1381151483,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there an optimal composition and length for protein linkers in FRET?","body":"<p>I'm designing a protein that I'd like to use in FRET reporting.

I have heard <code>SSG<\/code> is a good choice, but when I started a lit review I become unconvinced.  If it doesn't matter, I may try and put more convenient restriction sites there.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is there a good way to theoretically determine optimal length?  I realize that may change depending on which FRET protein pair is chosen.  The cleavage sites are between 15-18 AA long.  Unfortunately, I don't think I can give any more detail than that on the cleavage sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Response to answer:\nSo far there have been no FRET systems or tests published with the cleavage sites I want to study.  In fact, I haven't even heard of anyone else trying.  If I'm forced into a positive FRET probe, which I'm worried that I am, does anyone have any FRET pairings that don't interfere with Texas-Red on the spectrum?

I'm assuming you are interested in expression microarrays.  Genotyping microarrays are also very popular these days and are quite different though. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Where can I understand the matrix of the dataset ?<\/strong>\nThis is a little unclear as a question, but I'll start with a numerical description.  Microarray data is reducible to a one dimensional array of intensities.  As a vector of numbers, each representing the amount of a given species of RNA in a sample, it has many interpretations.  Most of what is said here applies to RNASeq data too. <\/p>\n\n<p>These numbers are sequence dependent - that is, they should not be interpreted as an absolute count of a specific mRNA in the sample, so comparing two entries in the vector (e.g. \"gene A has 10% more RNA than gene B\") will probably not be useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this reason, microarray experiments are typically done as difference experiments, where two or more conditions are compared, producing a matrix of numbers, where N rows represent N experiments, and the M columns each represent a probe set / gene.  The transpose of this matrix is also common. <\/p>\n\n<p>*<em>Methods to classify microarray results. *<\/em> \nTaking the matrix of data, there are many ways of interpreting data in matrix form and most of them have been tried credibly with microarray data. <\/p>\n\n<p>The most common are to take a set of probe sets whose biological action are related (e.g. all in a metabolic pathway and display them as a heat map where the columns have been <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering\" rel=\"nofollow\">clustered by a distance based algorithm<\/a> to produce a tree, where neighbors have the greatest numerical similarity. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CTVS1.png\" alt=\"heat map\"><\/p>\n\n<p>For purely numerical methods, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_component_analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Principal Component Analysis<\/a> is often used (despite the fact that <a href=\"http://machine-master.blogspot.com/2012/08/pca-or-polluting-your-clever-analysis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this is not a great method<\/a>), but Self Organizing Maps, neural nets and just about any machine learning algorithm have been used.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Most common method by far though, is Analysis of Variants (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anova\" rel=\"nofollow\">ANOVA<\/a>), where the probe sets/ genes have been scored by their greatest to smallest variance.  The most common case of this is a two condition difference experiment where the largest differences are taken as results.  This is not a great experiment, but the data is not super cheap to produce. <\/p>\n\n<p>*<em>Microarray data repositories *<\/em>\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gene Expression Omnibus<\/a> (GEO) is a highly regarded repository for microarray data, with over a million sets of data. They also have some tools, see below. <\/p>\n\n<p>EMBL <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ArrayExpress<\/a> claims to have slightly more data than GEO (1.2 M assays). <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many many specialized microarray websites, mostly focusing on a particular organism (E coli for instance) or problem (like cancer).  Google is pretty helpful for this sort of thing once you have the right keywords. <\/p>\n\n<p>*<em>Web based tools for microarray analysis *<\/em>\nThere are several tools you will use for microarray analysis and there are lots of websites for different aspects of this data.  I'm going to cite a couple, but the most commonly used tools are command line tools like R/bioconductor or the software that comes from the array manufacturer.  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GEO2R<\/a> is a great tool to browse expression data experiments.

I'm not kidding, <strong>all<\/strong> of them.  I would marry this review if I could.<sup>1<\/sup>  It also includes information on other animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main takeaway is that IgA from milk is <strong>not<\/strong> readily absorbed by the infant body.  Secreted IgA is mainly to provide a protective coating for the mucosa while the infant is developing its own nascent immune system.  IgG passed along from the placenta (your <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/11089/4101\">other question<\/a>) provides the main source of absorbed antibodies.  As it says in the review:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Milk sIgA is not taken up by the infant\u2019s intestinal mucosa. In fact, gut closure in humans occurs before birth and little immunoglobulin is absorbed intact in the intestine after birth. However, the presence of sIgA in the intestinal lumen is part of the protective function of the epithelial barrier in the intestine... Secretory IgA is considered to be the primary immunoglobulin responsible for immune protection of mucosal surfaces such as the intestine.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In terms of enzymatic activity, the digestive system will in indeed chomp up the antibodies; that's part of the reason breast feeding should continue as needed.  That's okay, because there's plenty to go around:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Much of the immunoglobulin consumed in an immune milk can be expected to be partially or completely digested, however some portion of the immunoglobulin will remain intact or at least partially intact and capable of binding to an antigen.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It turns out that immunoglobulins are moderately resistant to digestion, at least more so than other milk proteins.  There's a section in there detailing some experiments where Ab was given to individuals:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In adult humans consuming a bovine whey protein concentrate, approximately 59% of IgG and IgM was detected by radial immunodiffusion from effluents from the jejunum, while 19% was detected in the ileum. These estimates of digestion of immunoglobulin compare with estimates of digestion of milk proteins in adult humans which are approximately 42% complete at the end of the jejunum and 93% complete by the end of the ileum, again underscoring the relative resistance of immunoglobulins to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Digestive enzymes vary as to which antibody they prefer to digest, but at least some of them will technically digest the antibody, but still leave functional Fab fragments, which are still immunologically active and useful to the infant immune system.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>1: Did I mention I love this review?

Various factor of the environment will also play a major role in damaging the body while under contact. The following quote explains it:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The minimum current a human can feel depends on the current type (AC or DC) and frequency. A person can feel at least 1 mA (rms) of AC at 60 Hz, while at least 5 mA for DC. At around 10 milliamperes, AC current passing through the arm of a 68 kg (150 lb) human can cause powerful muscle contractions; the victim is unable to voluntarily control muscles and cannot release an electrified object. This is known as the \"let go threshold\" and is a criterion for shock hazard in electrical regulations. The current may, if it is high enough, cause tissue damage or fibrillation which leads to cardiac arrest; more than 30 mA of AC (rms, 60 Hz) or 300 \u2013 500 mA of DC can cause fibrillation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To give a clear picture of how various current threshold will affect human body see the image below. (Complete data is available here <a href=\"http://www.me.utexas.edu/~longoria/me340/leks/notes/18_ElectricalSafety_IrwinKernsCh21.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Electrical Safety\"<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/om48j.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Even High Voltage also can be fatal to human body which is enough to cause damage.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>High voltage electrical energy greatly reduces the body's resistance by quickly breaking down human skin. Once the skin is punctured, the lowered resistance results in massive current flow. Ohm's law is used to demonstrate the action.\n  At 1,000 volts, Current = Volts/Ohms = 1,000/500 = 2 Amps, which can cause cardiac arrest and serious damage to internal organs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now what is the length of time that body is under electrical contact. This length of time exposure is also critical.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When muscular contraction caused by stimulation does not allow the victim to free himself from the circuit, even relatively low voltages can be extremely dangerous, because the degree of injury increases with the length of time the body is in the circuit. LOW VOLTAGE DOES NOT IMPLY LOW HAZARD!\n  100mA for 3 seconds = 900mA for .03 seconds\n  in causing fibrillation<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(Complete detail is available <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/construction/electrical_incidents/eleccurrent.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Electrical Current Affects the Human Body<\/a>)<\/p>\n","answer_id":10990,"question_id":10988,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4630743186dc886cdf9f60468d574b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4720,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4720/bleamer","reputation":128,"display_name":"Bleamer"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":11069,"edited":false,"creation_date":1382611642,"comment_id":14813,"body":"Please write a short summary of the information in the article."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1382606433,"creation_date":1382606433,"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_3/4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> deals with the issue in detail.<\/p>\n","answer_id":11069,"question_id":10988,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10988/breakdown-current-for-human-body","last_activity_date":1382606433,"creation_date":1382360463,"answer_count":2,"title":"Breakdown current for human body","body":"<p>If I am not mistaken, during exposure to electricity sources it is the magnitude of the current and not the voltage that kills the human body.

It is based on concentration gradients. <\/p>\n\n<p>Briefly, certain cells secrete signaling molecules (called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogen\">morphogens<\/a>) that are detected by other cells. These molecules then activate the transcription of genes in the target cells. Since the molecules in question are produced by a subset of cells, their concentration varies according to the distance between the receiving cell and the producing cells. Different concentrations of the signalling molecules have different effects and this allows the formation of really quite complex patterns.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be illustrated very well using Wolpert's classic <a href=\"http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/french-flag-model\">French Flag Model<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/I1UuL.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So, different concentration thresholds of the morphogen result in different patterns of gene expression. This simple system can give extremely complex results (such as yourself, for example). It gets more complex when there are multiple morphogens acting in tandem. Say morphogen1 is produced by cells on the left and morphogen2 by cells on the right, cells in the middle will have varying concentrations of both morphogens and will react accordingly:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xIAmF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Just about every pattern formation during development boils down to differential concentrations of diffusing morphogen molecules, it really is a wonderful example of how simple systems can give rise to extremely complex results. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On an unrelated note, this has absolutely nothing to do with evolution. At least no more so than any other biological process. If your friends do not accept evolution, I don't see how they can use this as an argument. Even if a god created humanity in his or her image as these people tend to believe, babies are still born and they still develop in the womb. As far as I know, even the most fundamentalist Christians do not believe in a mechanic god that puts babies together in the womb from some kind of IKEA kit. Even if humans sprung fully formed from the hands of this god, individual infants are still formed out of multiple cells. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can coordinate this process, whether this mechanism evolved or was designed is irrelevant, it is still there and extremely easily observable (images taken from <a href=\"http://dev.biologists.org/content/133/3/385/F1.large.jpg\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/a4SQ2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The image above shows the locations and concentrations of various morphogens in a fruit fly embryo.

In each of these cases the DNA repair genes do not <em>stop<\/em> mutations, they only reduce the number of mutations that occur.  Its well known that all sorts of living things can die of radiation poisoning and new mutations that have occurred recently are observed in all living things.  <\/p>\n\n<p>2) The argument has been given some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution_%28biology%29\">detail in Wikipedia<\/a>.  I would just say here that if some mutations has little selective power, but when there are enough of them to show a real disadvantage, then they will be eliminated from the gene pool.  They don't just all of a sudden get together and say 'here we are - you are dead!'  Selection is pretty good at finding pretty small disadvantages and kicking out the responsible variants. I guess the answer is the system is more robust than is assumed in this statement. <\/p>\n\n<p>That's not to say that low profile mutations can't combine and kill a living thing - they do.  Every generation of people genetic diseases kill thousands of people.  There are also lots of others who do not experience such diseases.  No family will be exempt from such defects over time, but nearly all families will continue as well.  The proportion being predicted here is not realistic. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are species that go extinct too.  So all this does happen, but not in the proportions or degree being speculated. Really mountains are being made of molehills here. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) There may be some cases where 5000 mutations (or even fewer) might prevent interbreeding between subpopulations to create species of a sort.  But in most cases it takes a lot more mutations than that to create a new species.  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/evolving-bacteria\">Bacterial species are entirely different from animals and plants<\/a>.  They don't need to breed to make offspring in the sense eukaryotes do.  Often they can't.  Bacterial species usually reproduce by single celled fission - they cells just split.  occasionally they transfer DNA, but they can do so between species by more than one means.  In the link its noted that bacterial speciation has been observed in the lab.  Just among the 30 or so E coli strains that are sequenced the number of genes can vary by 50%.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So though there are very few species of bacteria named, its also possible to say that there are many trillions of bacterial species, because they work in such a different way than we are used to seeing among animals and plants. <\/p>\n\n<p>4) While I can't really verify the numbers here, the idea that we could estimate all the possible species seems difficult.  There are definitely more species possible then there are atoms in the universe.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many more powerful arguments that there is one common ancestor to all living thing on earth.  Each living thing shares exactly the same mechanisms for preserving information - DNA, copying the DNA into RNA and then translating this into protein.  The idea that this would evolve in the same way twice seems completely unlikely.  Moreover there are genes in bacteria that have the same shape and work in the same way as in human beings and every other animal.  In fact the phylogenetic 'tree of life' shows that the more similar two living things are, the closer they resemble each other in terms of their sequence.  This is the primary argument for the last universal ancestor (LUA).  Most folks would have to have a counterargument that against this evidence.  The generation of a ribosome in the laboratory from primordial chemicals might be such an argument, since we think it took nearly a trillion years for it to happen the first time, I would be genuinely astonished to see it happen again.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":9595,"question_id":9587,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":20,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":9596,"edited":false,"creation_date":1375470577,"comment_id":12618,"body":"Excellent answer +1.

You have to consider that a body (the human one, for example) contains <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/11/28/how-many-cells-are-there-in-th/\">several trillion cells<\/a>, <em>each<\/em> of which contains 3 billion nucleotides each of which can be mutated. So, if the human body has, say, 50 trillion cells (a relatively conservative estimate), that means that a mutation <em>could<\/em> occur at any of <\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3e10^9 * 5e10^{13} = 15e10^{22}$ = 150000000000000000000000<\/p>\n\n<p>different sites. So even though the cell is pretty good at catching and correcting errors, some are bound to get through from pure statistical chance. In any case, you <em>know<\/em> that not all errors are corrected, diseases such as cancer are often the direct result of such mutations and errors.<\/p>\n\n<p>I should also point out that in sexually reproducing species (such as humans) mutations are passed on to offspring only if they occur in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametogenesis\">one of the cells<\/a> that become gametes (sperm or eggs) so this does not accurately represent the number of available sites that can give rise to mutations that can directly affect evolution for sexual species. Other species however, do not reproduce sexually. For example, cutting a worm like <em>C. elegans<\/em> in half will result in two worms so a mutation in any of its cells could be passed on to its offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, point mutations are not the only way that diversity is generated. Even in the absence of mutations, processes such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover\">chromosomal cross-over<\/a> during gamete cell division (this is what makes you into a mixture of your Mom and Dad) would still produce differences that selection can act upon.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2 Genetic entropy<\/h2>\n\n<p>This one is a bit harder to answer, largely because it is complete poppycock. I'll try though. Let's see, we do <em>not<\/em> have \"more mutations than our parents\", what an absurd idea! The silent assumption here is that there was a \"perfect\" genome and each mutation is carrying us further from it. Therefore, since my parents were closer to this platonic ideal of the perfect DNA, each mutation that occurs in my cells takes their genomes a further step from that perfection. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is very simply wrong. There was never a perfect genome, each cell in each individual of each species in the world is constantly undergoing mutations and has always done so. The genome is <strong>dynamic<\/strong>, not static and it has never been static, it can't be. DNA is a chemical substance and undergoes chemical reactions (such as mutations) all the time. Like all other chemicals it exists in a thermodynamic equilibrium, but not a static one. The only way that I have \"more mutations\" than my parents is if you accept <em>as a premise<\/em> that humanity comes from the perfect genomes of Adam and Eve. Since this is what Mr. Sanford is, presumably, attempting to demonstrate, using it as a premise is, at best, a circular argument. <\/p>\n\n<p>Unless you assume the existence of a platonic ideal of a genome you cannot say whether I have more or fewer mutations than my parents because how can you compare them? In order to say that I have more mutations than my parents, you would need to quantify the number of mutations that each of us has and that cannot be done. How do you count mutations? You would need a reference genome of the ancestral human and we don't have that.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest of the argument is even more nonsensical. Mutations can either be completely neutral and therefore \"unselectable\" or they can have an effect. <strong>By definition<\/strong>, if a mutation has an effect, it can be selected for or against. That's how selection works. So, stating that these tiny mutations (which do exist) cannot be selected for/against <em>and yet<\/em> are harmful is a direct contradiction. You can only have one or the other. If they are harmful, there will be a selective pressure to change/correct/lose these mutations. <\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, if these things \"are left to build up in all people until the entire human race becomes extinct\" all that means is that these things build up in individuals of a species and the species changes. Ummm, well, yes, we have a name for that, it's called evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just a final point, tRNAs have their own specific genes, a random mutation in an intergenic region will have no effect on them, why should it? This just shows the fundamental ignorance of the author in question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Oh, and the whole \"Junk DNA\" is a very complex question. Yes, we now know that a lot of what was termed \"Junk DNA\" has a function (this was no surprise by the way, \"Junk\" was never intended to be taken literally). All this means is that mutations in non-coding DNA can also be harmful. OK, fine, then they will be selected against because that is how evolution works.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3 \"meta-informaton paradox\" (whatever that is)<\/h2>\n\n<p>This idea is often bandied by creationists but is a basic misunderstanding. Mutations are random(ish), evolution <strong>is not<\/strong> remotely random. Advantageous mutations that make an individual more likely to reproduce will tend to be selected for and spread across a population while deleterious mutations will tend to be selected against and be removed from the gene pool. This is not a random process at all. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for the \"meta-information\", nothing is \"independent\". The cell is a complex system with extremely complicated interactions and a lot of cross-talk between the different processes. The DNA is not separate from the cell, it is an integral part of it. The Aristotelian idea of reductionist logic where you study complex systems by cutting them into little bits and understanding those bits is all very well as an intellectual tool but that is all it is, a tool. In reality, complex systems should be studied in their entirety, you cannot disassociate DNA from DNA regulation.  <\/p>\n\n<h2>4 The pseudo math hypothesis<\/h2>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at these assumptions. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Assumption 1: \"Evolution must occur by a net gain in new information. \"\nOf course not. Evolution can create a net loss in complexity (information) just as often (indeed, probably more so) as a net gain. The classic example of this are viruses. They have evolved into lean, mean, minimalist killing machines. They have <em>nothing<\/em> that is not absolutely essential. Hardly a net gain in information.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Assumption 2: I don't know where these numbers are coming from, whenever you read a phrase that starts with \"scientists have observed\", run away. What scientists? How have they observed this? How do they define beneficial? Anyway, let's say these numbers are right (I really really doubt it, but let's say they are for the sake of argument).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Assumption 3: Huh? Let's just throw some random numbers and see if they stick. There is no magical number of changes that results in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation\">speciation<\/a>. In mutations as in real estate, it's \"location, location, location\". The question is not how <em>many<\/em> mutations but where they have occurred and what effect they have had.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Assumption 4: Wow, this one is just completely wrong. To pick just one problem here, if 10 million species is the upper limit of species living today, and 99% of all species have become extinct, how does it follow that 10 million can also be a good estimate of all the species that have come before? If the 10 million of today are only 1% of all the species that have ever lived (99% are extinct right?) then it follows that the number of species that have existed is around one billion.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Assumption 5: It is most certainly not true that every beneficial mutation is fixed. Many are, others aren't. Also, bear in mind that the same mutation can be both beneficial and harmful in different contexts. For example, a mutation that makes me more resistant to cold would be very useful during an ice age but less so (and could be harmful) during a period of high temperatures. To take a classic example, there is a known mutation in some humans that makes them susceptible to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\">sickle-cell anaemia<\/a>. However, the <em>same<\/em> mutation also protects from malaria. So, is this one harmful or beneficial? That depends on whether you are living somewhere where malaria is prevalent or not. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>OK, so now the numbers. These wonderful probabilities all assume that evolution happens through \"beneficial\" mutations. First of all, that is not the only way that genomes change. I mentioned chromosomal crossing over earlier and you also have things like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\">genetic drift<\/a> (you also have all sorts of other weird things such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer\">horizontal transfer<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, it does not take X beneficial mutations to make a new species. As I said, there is no magic number and evolution is not restricted to beneficial mutations. Just mutations. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the most serious problem in this reasoning is that you are not calculating probabilities, you are calculating frequencies. What the argument you are presenting says is that it will take $10^{150billion}$ events for 10 million species to evolve from a common ancestor. It says absolutely nothing about the probability of such events because you are not taking into account the size of the event pool. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let me explain, if you toss a coin, you have a 50-50 chance of getting either heads or tails. Therefore, getting 5 heads in a row is not very likely <strong>if you throw five times<\/strong>. If, however, you throw a few billion coins a few trillion times, you are very very likely to at some point get 5 heads in a row. In order to calculate the probability of something you need to take into account the number of tests performed. <\/p>\n\n<p>If we keep the arbitrary numbers you have quoted, we have 10 million species, let's say each of them has a genome of 1 million base pairs and each has just 10 cells whose genome is passed on to their offspring (non-sexually reproducing species are actually the vast majority but most of them are unicellular so let's just take 10 as an average). Let us also assume that the creationists are right, the world is about ten thousand years old and let's say that species live for an average of two years (absolutely wrong of course but let's just pick small numbers). Finally, let's say that each species has only 1 million living individuals (again wildly conservative, just think of the number of ants in the world). This means that we are talking about <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>10 million species * 10 cells each * 1 million individuals * 1 million bases per cell = 100000000000000000000 <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If the rate of mutations is a tiny (much much smaller than the real value) 1 mutation every 24 hours, this means that there are $10^{20} * 365$ potential mutations a year. And, therefore, there have been $10^{20} * 3650000 = 365*10^{23}$ opportunities for mutation in the last 10000 years, that's 365 followed by 23 zeroes, that's a hell of a lot of chances. So, yes, if one in a thousand of them were beneficial that still makes it really quite likely that such mutations have occurred and have caused speciation events. This becomes even more likely if we take a realistic estimate of the time elapsed (10000 years is extreme for all but the most bullheaded of creationists).<\/p>\n","answer_id":9596,"question_id":9587,"up_vote_count":20,"last_edit_date":1382579900}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9587/how-does-the-modern-theory-of-evolution-solve-these-apparent-problems","last_activity_date":1382579900,"creation_date":1375447605,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does the modern theory of evolution solve these apparent problems?","body":"<p>I hold to the truth of Evolution, but I've encountered several problems with it, that I can't answer, and I can't find an answer for, despite much research. If would be great if anyone can answer these supposedly fatal problems for Biological Evolution, since I find it troubling that there appears to be no answer for these.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem/Question #1:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The first one is called the mutation protection paradox. Simply put, Evolution has evolved mechanisms to protect itself from mutations, that if left unchecked, would build up and wreck the biological system, yet the mutation repair and protection mechanisms guard and stop the very changes that allow Evolution to occur, which is mutation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there an answer to this paradox?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem/Question #2:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The problem of genetic entropy. John Sanford has supposedly shown in his book Genetic Entropy and the mystery of the genome, that the human genome is degrading so quickly, that we could not have evolved from ape like creatures over millions of years.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is supposedly that we have 100-300 more mutations than either of our parents. This is supposed to mean that 100-300 new mutations accumulate in every person, in every single generation. Then it's said that these mutations are so small they cannot be gotten rid of by natural selection, and that the vast majority are harmful to the human genotype.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because the mutations are unselectable, they are left to build up in all people until the entire human race becomes extinct, and it is estimated that this should have occurred in less than 80,000 years. So if Evolution were true, we wouldn't be here to talk about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The person presenting this problem gave answers to two responses. He gave a response to the Evolutionist retort that most mutations are not harmful but neutral by saying \"most mutations are neutral from the perspective of the organism\u2019s physical fitness (phenotype), but all mutations must have effect on the genetic content (genotype). In no way are mutations truly neutral \u2013 they all must have effect on the genotype, even if they only affect the efficiency of transferRNA production. And as pointed out above, most are harmful.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Then he gave a response to the Evolutionist retort that -almost all of the unselectable mutations will occur in non-coding regions of the DNA (the so-called, Junk DNA), and therefore have no effect. Thus, the individual will not die and the population will not become extinct- by saying quote: <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Non-coding DNA does not code for proteins and scientists have previously thought it is largely useless. But mutations in the non-coding DNA won\u2019t make them without effect since non-coding DNA helps during embryonic development and can be a part of many diseases. The idea that non-coding DNA absorbs mutations, thereby making them neutral, is false and is merely an argument from ignorance.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there an answer to this?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem/Question #3:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>This can be called the meta-informaton paradox. How it goes is that you have two types of dynamics. Primary DNA which tells what proteins to make, and meta-information which tells the cell how to maintain the primary DNA. So it is said that primary DNA and meta-information are completely dependent on one another. If they become unrelated to each other, both become unusable and the animal would die.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is that mutations are random, and thus completely independent events, and this means primary DNA and meta-information would evolve by completely random and independent events and thus would not be able to stay relevant and related to one another, which then creates a barrier stopping microbes to man evolution from taking place.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem/Question #4:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The person claims his calculations show that there is 1 chance in 10 to the 150 billion, that all species have evolved, each from a previous species. Here's how his calculation works.<\/p>\n\n<p>He says he is being as generous as possible with Evolution, and has five assumptions:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Assumption 1<\/em>: Evolution must occur by a net gain in new information. However, this is completely disregarded. We will simply assume that all beneficial mutations produce evolutionary change (including so called 'neutral mutations' which become beneficial later on).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Assumption 2<\/em>: The rate of beneficial mutations is widely thought to be 1 for every million mutations. Indeed, scientists have observed millions more harmful or 'neutral' mutations than beneficial mutations. But we will assume that the frequency of occurrence is 1 beneficial mutation per 1,000 mutations.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Assumption 3<\/em>: It will be assumed that 5,000 mutations are needed to make a species 'evolve' into another species (where the two species cannot interbreed). Although the number needed for new single-celled species to arise is probably less, other higher animals require millions more beneficial mutations than accounted for here (40 million mutational differences exist between chimpanzees and humans[1], though different genus).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Assumption 4<\/em>: We will assume that the total amount of species that have lived in the past is 10 million. In fact, this is the upper end of the estimate for species living today. If 99% of all species have become extinct as many Darwinists claim, then our assumption is extremely generous.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Assumption 5<\/em>: It will be assumed that every single beneficial mutation is fixed in the population after occurrence.

All proteins are made on ribosomes: CFTR will be cotranslationally inserted into the ER membrane while secretory glycoproteins are cotranslationally sent across the same membrane into the lumen of the ER. In the ER the initial glycans are added to specific amino acid residues. The folding of all proteins is carefully monitored by chaperones in the ER to avoid misfolded proteins reaching the cell surface. Various folding factors also come into play, including peptidyl proline isomerase and protein disulphide isomerase. <\/p>\n\n<p>Proteins destined for the cell surface leave the ER in COPII-coated vesicles (CFTR will be in the vesicle membrane, secretory glycoproteins in the vesicle lumen) and are targetted to the Golgi where the glycosylation process is completed. Another round of vesicle transport gets the proteins to the cell surface - when these vesicles fuse with the inner surface of the plasma membrane the vesicle content is secreted into the surroundings, while the vesicle membrane proteins enter the plasma membrane.<\/p>\n\n<p>The classic example of a CFTR defect, resulting in cystic fibrosis, is due to the &Delta;F508 mutation - the loss of a single amino acid results in misfolding, and the defective protein is held in the ER resulting in loss of CFTR function at the cell surface. Overcoming this retention is one of the targets for CFTR therapy, because if the &Delta;F508 protein does manage to pass through the secretory pathway to the cell surface it provides sufficient channel function to abolish cystic fibrosis symptoms.<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven't cited any references here because this is all standard biochemistry/molecular cell biology textbook stuff, so should be easy to confirm.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10974,"question_id":10968,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c8eaa464f937625339f9f5e70bdbb57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4726,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4726/gent","reputation":11,"display_name":"Gent"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1382412261,"creation_date":1382412261,"body":"<p>There are a couple nice videos here: <a href=\"https://synbiota.com/projects/325/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://synbiota.com/projects/325/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You can also check out some DNA sequences and some protein structures (PDB files) if you want to learn more.<\/p>\n","answer_id":11006,"question_id":10968,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10968/question-about-production-of-cftr-protein","last_activity_date":1382412261,"creation_date":1382270098,"answer_count":2,"title":"Question about production of CFTR protein","body":"<p>How do organelles such as ribosomes, ER, Golgi and vesicles produce CFTR protein and mucus?<\/p>\n","question_id":10968,"tags":["biochemistry"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":337,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71b5177a738460e6c1c9dca5a04fb0db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4478,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4478/greg","reputation":163,"display_name":"Greg","accept_rate":75},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":0,"post_id":10998,"edited":false,"creation_date":1382394971,"comment_id":14678,"body":"What makes you think that Na+ and Cl- can be ignored?

And the 3<sub>10<\/sub> helix was not really right either - it did turn out to show up occasionally in protein structures though. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the time all of these secondary structure elements were well evidenced from noncrystalline diffraction data and small molecule crystal structures. Examples being collagen from hair and spider silk fiber diffraction patterns. Fiber diffraction of hair, whose ordered structure consists mainly of alpha helices somewhat aligned to the fiber axis (along the length of the hair) or the mainly beta sheets which constitute silk.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Because it was known that these substances contain mainly protein, building models which would show how regular peptide polymers would produce these patterns.  This happened in chemistry and physics departments worldwide.  The paper you cite is representative to the field.  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12966187\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pauling caused a splash in the spring of 1951 by publishing descriptions of the alpha helix and the beta sheet<\/a> (both parallel and antiparallel).  The main advantage that Pauling had was that he had studied the structure of simple di-amino acid structures (notably glycyl-glycine) and understood that the peptide bond had some double bond like properties which prevented it from rotating freely.  As the discoverer of <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/\" rel=\"nofollow\">valence bond theory<\/a>, which united quantum mechanics and chemistry and established the basis for at least most organic/biological chemical structures Pauling must have been practically alone in this insight at the time. <\/p>\n\n<p>This next set the stage for the dramatic race to discover the structure of DNA. If you read <a href=\"http://www.brown.edu/Courses/BI0020_Miller/dh/guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watsons' memoir<\/a>, he describes how the MRC in Cambridge was still feeling the heat,  competing with CalTech and Pauling.  He and the young lab there was holding their own against the MRC Cambridge with its multiple nobel laureates; a lab which had established the relationship of x-ray diffraction and chemical structure (the notes on chapter 7 are interesting - follow the link).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Looking back on it, Pauling's main advantage was that he understood the peptide bond better than the rest of the world. By the time DNA was being resolved, the conformations of organic molecules were understood by many and the playing field should have been more level.  I'm not sure I buy the arguments that Pauling would have got the structure without seeing the diffraction patterns and even then maybe not. I might not give such strong credence to the idea that Pauling would have gotten the DNA structure so quickly if he had been able to travel.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course Perutz and Kendrew verified the peptide alpha helix themselves when they solved the first crystal structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin, having the final say.  The structures contain a small amount of 3<sub>10<\/sub> helix but are otherwise full of alpha helices.  I'm not sure that the secondary structure was entirely confirmed until the 1958 when myoglobin was resolved.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":10960,"question_id":10959,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1382376951}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10959/which-of-perutz-et-als-protein-structures-other-than-3%e2%82%81%e2%82%80-helix-were-correct","last_activity_date":1382376951,"creation_date":1382208452,"answer_count":1,"title":"Which of Perutz et al's protein structures other than 3\u2081\u2080 helix were correct?","body":"<p>In 1950, Bragg, Kendrew and Perutz published \"<a href=\"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/203/1074/321.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polypeptide chain configurations in crystalline proteins<\/a>\" (<em>open access<\/em>) and were famously 'proved wrong' by Pauling, Corey and Branson the following year, in the paper that documented the alpha and gamma helices, \"<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/37/4/205\" rel=\"nofollow\">Two Hydrogen-Bonded Helical Configurations of the Polypeptide Chain<\/a>\" (<em>also OA<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm reading about this (as reviewed <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC208735/pdf/10011207.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for example) where the idea is that Bragg <em>et al<\/em> were disproved - in the words of the Pauling paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>None of these authors propose either our 3.7-residue [α] helix or our 5.1- residue [γ] helix.

That pigment is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin\" rel=\"nofollow\">melanin<\/a>.  To a much lesser extent, at least in health individuals, you can have lipofuscin produced which gives a golden-amber color to the eyes.  It should be noted that lipofuscin is most likely produced because of oxidation damage/stress in your eye, and not something to be hoping for (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039625700001405?np=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beatty et al<\/a> has a good review of the subject (1)).<\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, lipofuscin in the eyes can be seen as a symptom to physicians, so for the rest of the answer I will only consider melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin in particular, as the normative pigment in the iris.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make additional colors, we would need to develop an additional pigment, and or modify eumelanin so that it produces different scattering properties.  So why do we have melanocytes in the eye producing melanin in the first place?<\/p>\n\n<p>As much as we might consider it as a factor now, sexual selection was probably not the main pressure for having pigment in the eyes.  Instead UV protection almost assuredly is (2, 3).  Thus for another pigment to be selected for, it would probably need to do a better job protecting us vs. UV (also, further selection in humans is hampered by all kinds of things like behavior, medicine, and life span).<\/p>\n\n<p>Eumelanin does a good job protecting us from UV (2, 3) and in fact does a better job than phenomelanin (4).  It seems incredibly unlikely that we would develop the necessary evolutionary pressure to have our pigment epithelium to produce a totally foreign pigment.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that is what prevents us from naturally having a whole rainbow of colors in our iris.  One could conceivably engineer a better pigment, and have the genetic information needed to produce it delivered in gene therapy (I hate to think of people purposefully infecting their pigment epithelia).  I, for one, wouldn\u2019t sign up for that.<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) Beatty S. et al. The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.

It has a long history (e.g., <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2012.09.016\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neocognitoron by Fukushima was 1980<\/a>) and still widely accepted in machine learning (e.g., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">deep learning<\/a>) and neuroscience.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NCwoxM9.png?1\" alt=\"Neocognitron\"><\/p>\n\n<p>It is motivated by the organization of V1 simple cells and complex cells. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simple cells in V1<\/a> can be approximately thought of as edge detectors at a specific retinal location. This is why on the figure you cite, they are represented as a circle with a bar (a cartoon receptive field). The simple cells can only detect things very locally, meaning if the edge appears at a different location in your field of view, it will not respond.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mathematically, you can think of a spatial filter that detects an edge (e.g., oriented Gabor patch) multiplied to your retinal image, and summed. For example the filter below will detect match a 45 degree bar aligned on the hot-colored area, but will have less activity if the bar is shifted out of the specific position.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Gabor_filter.png\" alt=\"oriented Gabor patch\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">complex cells in V1<\/a>, on the other hand is still an edge detector, but has some location invariance. In other words, when the edge is slightly displaced, the response of complex cells does not seem to change. It is believed that this is because complex cells pull from multiple simple cells with the same orientation. This is what you see in your figure where a single complex cell pulls information from the same orientation simple cells but at different locations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mathematically, a soft-max operation or a max operation over the simple cell outputs can lead to a good complex cell model. But, it is not limited to such operations. In fact, <a href=\"http://memming.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/bayesian-spike-triggered-covariance-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">quadratic<\/a> or other nonlinear models are also widely used in computational neuroscience.<\/p>\n\n<p>The full hierarchy for ventral stream is then simply obtained by extending repeatedly using the simple-cell-complex-cell analogy. For each stack simple cell layer extracts some local feature (by computing on the previous layer's complex cell's output), and complex cell layer makes it invariant over space. From edges in V1, one can get corners on the next layer, then complex contours, and all the way up to objects.

Thus, the possibility that some organisms might engage in acts that help another organism at their own expense may seem like a paradox, or at least a puzzle in need of explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>One solution to this puzzle is offered by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution\">gene-centered view of evolution<\/a>, where selection is viewed as acting on genes, with organisms being merely convenient (and usually, but not always, cooperative) collections of genes that (usually) reproduce together.  From this viewpoint, it is not at all surprising that evolution might favor genes that cause an organism to help other organisms, provided that there's a statistical tendency for those other organisms to also be carrying the same gene.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation do also exist.  For example, organisms with sufficiently advanced cognitive capabilities may indeed engage in reciprocal altruism, where they help others only if those others have shown themselves willing to help them in exchange.  Such exchanges, being mutually beneficial, do indeed help both participating organisms, and are thus selected for even at the organism level.  However, to persist (in the absence of gene or group level selection effects), they generally need some form of enforcement and/or learning mechanism &mdash; if cheaters can keep receiving help without ever helping anyone else, they'll do better than the cooperators and eventually displace them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, in some situations, an organism acting simply to help itself (e.g. by modifying its environment to be more suitable for itself) may also end up helping other organisms that just happen to be nearby.  In such a situation, selection indeed favors cooperative behavior in isolated organisms by default, with the evolution and persistence of \"freeloaders\" (who spend less effort on improving their surrounding, relying instead on others to do the work) being only possible as long as there are sufficiently many cooperators around.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, none of these mechanisms are mutually exclusive.  Indeed, the presence of <em>some<\/em> gene-level selection effects tends to be unavoidable in any realistic situation involving cooperative interactions; it's hard to come up with a setting in which no two interacting organisms <em>ever<\/em> share genes, and obviously the fact that two organisms share a common genetic predisposition to cooperate makes them more likely to do so when they meet.<\/p>\n\n<p>(However, one not-so-realistic theoretical limit case where that does happen is that of an infinitesimally rare cooperative mutant invading an infinitely large and well mixed population.  The popular use of this simplifying limit assumption in classical models of evolution may be one reasons why cooperative behavior is so often seen as something remarkable and hard to explain by evolutionary theorists.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":2113,"question_id":2109,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1336211343},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1382270134,"creation_date":1382270134,"body":"<p>Selfish behaviour is not necessarily preferred.

We have maps to locate sensorial signals (in fact, all our senses are neural maps representations), to locate our muscles and we even have secondary maps that allow to compare the movements we desire to make and the movements we are actually making. The integration of all of this maps leads to a pretty accurate idea of ourself, and that's critical for selfconciousness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, our brains uses our senses to create images of our immediate sorroundings. They also need to locate other important places (for instance, even if you're at home you would proably have a mental idea of how far your workplace is). Moreover, we have a psicological idea of time wich places ourselfes in a present after a bunch of events that have already happened andd before a set of possible events that we have modelized or predicted with the information from the past. All of this creates an idea of our place in the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>By combining this two ideas we have a global mental model of our own state, our own desires, our own characteristics, etc... placed in an mental image of the world based in our previous experience.

Second, the inner logical architecture of computers and brains is quite different, being maybe the lack of biologycal instincts the most relevant difference.

What we call consciousness is thought to be an evolutionary elaboration of a property of cells called \"irritability\", which is the cell's ability to respond to signals from its environment.  There are many manifestations of this: chemicals binding to protein receptors, light interacting with proteins (as in photosynthesis), mechanical forces causing cell movement, bacterial chemo-taxis, and the list goes on.<\/p>\n\n<p>The analogy is like this.  What we call eating and elimination are analogous to cell metabolism.  As a whole organism we must eat to replenish the body, and eliminate the waste produced. A single cell must also absorb nutrients to maintain itself and eliminate the waste products.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, it is like a fractal.  The same functions displayed by individual cells also manifest at the level of the whole organism. So, as the GI tract is the organ analogous to cell metabolism, the nervous system is the organ analogous to cell irritability.  One could imagine that what we experience as our personal consciousness is in fact like taking an integral over the irritability of all the cells in our nervous system.  Many people focus on the neurons, but all the cells in the brain contribute to the brain's function.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, this form of explanation is not really an explanation as much as it is a description of our biology.  The obvious question arises: why are cells irritable? Because, irritability is basically the individual consciousness of an individual cell.  Well, one then realizes that the response properties of cells to stimuli come from the action of the molecules and forces that make up the cell. The immediate forces are non-covalent interactions, mainly poorly understood even in terms of physics, such as forms of adhesion (consider Velcro or glue). These are emergent properties that stem from the assemblage of molecules of which cells are composed.<\/p>\n\n<p>But let us grant that physicists eventually come to understand such \"derived\" forces in terms of the elementary four forces of the universe: electromagnetism, gravity, strong and weak nuclear.  Then, it is clear that there is a potential contained in these forces to combine in ways that cause complex molecular assemblies that self-organize and display irritability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the issue of consciousness presumably links back to somehow being an inherent emergent property of the forces of nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, this is all relatively uncontroversial, but building such a chain of explanation is not really an explanation as much as just being a description of how things are organized in the world.  And I think it is clear to any thinking person that a description of something is not the same as an explanation of something.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, if you follow this far, then you can appreciate why the Greeks thought that Atlas, who held up the world, stood on the back of a tortoise, and this tortoise was on top of another tortoise who was on top of another tortoise, all the way to infinity.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have simply replaced Atlas and the tortoises with language of modern science.  It is still an infinite regress.  The short answer to \"why are things conscious\" is that it seems to be a property of the universe to display consciousness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, there is one great man who thought about this problem and constructed what I consider the best explanation.  This was Gottfried Leibniz, the man who invented calculus.  Leibniz invented the idea of a \"monad\", and he considered monads as the basic units, the atoms, in the sense of being the indivisible units of reality.  The monad, as an atom, is pure consciousness.  So, Leibniz came to the conclusion that the reason there is consciousness is because consciousness is the fundamental building block of reality.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Monads are what everything is made of: us, cells, atoms, quarks, electrons, etc.  These are all different forms of monads.  According to Leibniz, they are all different forms of consciousness, and they combine in fractal patterns to make forms of consciousness within forms of consciousness within forms of consciousness.  And this pattern goes in both directions from the infinitely small to the infinitely large.  According to this idea, just because something does not seem to be conscious in the same form we are conscious does not mean it is not conscious. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is how Leibniz solved what is called the \"mind body problem\", which is really the heading under which your question falls.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If one wishes merely for intellectual understanding of the nature of our consciousness, it is my opinion that Leibniz' ideas are the best available.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you wish to go beyond mere intellectual understand to a deeper level of awareness of these issues, then I suggest you look up and study the works of a writer named Patanjali.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10506,"question_id":10217,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1379648033},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1382262541,"creation_date":1382262541,"body":"<p><strong>Disclaimer<\/strong>: there is a very large amount of literature on the subject and I am in no way expert enough to properly review it here.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, here's a few papers that review the issue and may serve as a basis to look up other references<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754370\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolution of consciousness: phylogeny, ontogeny, and emergence from general anesthesia<\/a> - Mashour and Alkire, <strong>PNAS<\/strong> <em>2013<\/em><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We propose that the stepwise emergence from general anesthesia can serve as a reproducible model to study the evolution of consciousness across various species and use current data from anesthesiology to shed light on the phylogeny of consciousness. Ultimately, we conclude that the neurobiological structure of the vertebrate central nervous system is evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved across species and that <strong>the basic neurophysiologic mechanisms supporting consciousness in humans are found at the earliest points of vertebrate brain evolution<\/strong>.<br>\n  [...]\n  The distinction between phenomenal and access consciousness was noted, but phenomenal consciousness itself reflects the dissociable neurobiologica processes of <strong>awareness<\/strong> and <strong>arousal<\/strong>. Awareness refers to the content of consciousness (red apple vs. blue sky), whereas arousal refers to brain activation and level-of-consciousness (alert vs. drowsy vs. asleep vs. anesthetized). A number of current theories about consciousness propose that the cortex is the primary site containing the neural correlates of awareness, whereas midline subcortical brain structures provide ascending arousal influences to the cortex<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also reviewed in this paper:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15766888\" rel=\"nofollow\">Subjective experience is probably not limited to humans: the evidence from neurobiology and behavior.<\/a> - Baars, <strong>Conscious Cogn.<\/strong>, <strong>2005<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus consciousness is not a metaphysical absolute, but a scientific construct like any other. In humans, the standard behavioral index of conscious cognition is accurate or verifiable report. It has been used scientifically since the beginning of psychophysics in the 1820s. Accurate report is highly reliable, but of course it is subject to limitations like any other empirical measure (Baars, 1988).<br>\n  [...]<br>\n  In humans the thalamus and cortex are crucial for supporting the contents of consciousness (Edelman &amp; Tononi, 2000). Thalamus is often considered to be an extension of cortex, an added sandwich of interacting layers that controls most traffic to and from cortex. <strong>Local damage to cortical sensory regions, like the fusiform gyrus for face perception, results in a loss of conscious knowledge about faces but not about other visual features like color, location, or size. If the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus are lesioned bilaterally, the conscious state is lost.<\/strong> By comparison, large lesions to cerebellum, basal ganglia, and spinal cord do not impair either conscious contents or state. Cerebellar damage can cause paralysis but not loss of consciousness. Lesion evidence on these points is supported by stimulation experiments using electrodes, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and microdialysis. It is also reflected in functional brain imaging. The evidence is therefore very strong that <strong>the T-C system supports consciousness<\/strong>. That is why many neuroscientists consider the T-C system to be the \u201cseat\u201d of conscious experience, and have done so for at least a century.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, citing from the first paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The recent experiments with general anesthesia in humans suggest that phylogenetically ancient structures in the brainstem and diencephalon\u2014with only limited neocortical involvement\u2014are sufficient to support primitive consciousness. Where, then, does consciousness arise on the evolutionary timeline? One might be tempted to conclude that consciousness commenced as our mammalian ancestors evolved just beyond reptiles and their predominantly subcortical brains. However, paleontological findings suggest that the synapsid line that gave rise to mammals and the sauropsid line that gave rise to reptiles and birds both diverged from the primitive anapsid line at a single point ~315 million years ago. Furthermore, there is significant evidence that avian species are capable of higher cognition and even consciousness itself. For example, birds demonstrate evidence of explicit episodic recall (i.e., conscious memory of an event) and theory of mind (i.e., attribution of subjective mental events to another being). Thus, it would be misguided to try to identify a single point at which consciousness emerged because evidence suggests that consciousness evolved along two independent lineages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":10967,"question_id":10217,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10217/why-are-things-conscious","last_activity_date":1382262541,"creation_date":1378158216,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why are things conscious?","body":"<p>I've been referred to here from <a href=\"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/8052/why-are-things-conscious\">http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/8052/why-are-things-conscious<\/a>.

Bilateral and radial are the two basic types, which served as main classificatory character for animal mega-systematics in the past.]<\/p>\n\n<p>It's assumed that body symmetry is associated with general environmental gradients.<\/p>\n\n<p>Animals with (elements of) radial symmetry have one dorso-ventral axis which echos only one environmental gradient: substrate/water column, depth etc. Besides this polarity, resources/signals/danger may come from any direction. Imagine a Hydra polyp with its foot attached to a waterweed and its tentacles surrounding the mouth on the opposite end and expecting the victim to come from any side.<\/p>\n\n<p>Body of bilateral animals possesses the same dorso-ventral axis and yet another polarity, orthogonal to it: the anterior-posterior axis. This axis is conjugated with the gradient created by locomotion: the anterior margin of the body is likely to encounter something new first. This principle lies in the basis of cephalization: most bilaterial animals have more or less shaped \"head\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolutionary changes in body symmetry are thus thought to be associated with changes in life-style, e.g.:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>there is a hypothesis that cnidarians were originally bilateral (and many of them still show some degree bilaterality), but lost it after becoming sedentary.<\/li>\n<li>non-walkers echinoderms originated from fully bilateral animals and later acquired their famed pentameric radial symmetry (were they originally fully sedentary like modern stalked sea lilies?).

Such calculations make sense only for populations not for a given parent-offpsring pair.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>genetic<\/strong>: It does not make sense to ask whether the variance of a trait is dominant or recessive. It makes sense to say that \"liking pink\" is dominant over \"liking blue\". Therefore, you should tell us what is the variant of a given trait that you share with your mother. In such case we might tell you if this variant is dominant or not over the other variants. But of course, this works only for traits that are at least slightly genetically determined. liking a color will certainly not have a strong genetic variance for example. And even if a trait is 100% genetically determined, complex genetic architecture might make it hard to answer. For example a given variant might be dominant in a given genetic background but recessive in another. Finally, I should say that it costs to perform the necessary study (Genome Wide Association Studies) to know exactly the part of the variance of a given trait that is genetically determined. And of course, such studies depend on the population we look at.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple testing issue<\/strong>: Without realizing, you actually looked at many different traits. You might have looked at your favorite color, your favorite beer, the way you wash your teeth, the sport you practice, the color of room, whether you are calm or impulsive, etc...
