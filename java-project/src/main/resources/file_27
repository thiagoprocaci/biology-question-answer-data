Ion channels and electrophysiology can be a very confusing topic. Part of the challenge to understanding these processes is that you need to be able to remember that ions (e.g. sodium, potassium and calcium) are not only trying to move towards <em>chemical<\/em> equilibrium, but also <em>electrical<\/em> equilibrium as well. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion is tightly regulated. As you state in the question, glucose enters the beta-cell and is metabolized creating an INCREASE in the ATP content of the cell. This increased ATP binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channels and CLOSES them. Remember, these channels are typically OPEN and allow potassium to normally flow OUT of the cell (because that would be potassium flowing DOWN its concentration gradient... potassium concentration is higher inside the cell than outside the cell). Note: This is the opposite for calcium, which would flow INTO the cell and down its concentration gradient (calcium outside the cell is higher than calcium inside the cell).<\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time the ATP-sensitive channels are acting, there are Na/K ATPase pumps at work to move sodium OUT of the cell and potassium INTO to the cell (against the concentration gradients of both those ions). When the ATP-sensitive potassium channels close, it causes a build up of potassium INSIDE the cell because you have made the cell less permeable to potassium (when potassium can't flow OUT of the cell through the CLOSED ATP-sensitive channels it makes the membrane less polarized - i.e. become less negative or more positive - however you want to think about it). <\/p>\n\n<p>When the cell reaches a threshold potential (that is, when it becomes depolarized to a certain point), it will cause opening of a type of voltage sensitive calcium channels. At this point, calcium channels open and allow calcium to flow down its concentration gradient and INTO the beta-cells. This calcium entry is required for the release of insulin vesicles through a mechanism that is outside the scope of this question, but unrelated to the calcium channels opening and closing. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H7qWs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H7qWs.jpg\" alt=\"Beta-cell schematic from Open Access Article\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing about the calcium channels is that they INACTIVATE after a short amount of time and CLOSE on their own. Inactivation and closure is an intrinsic property of that type of calcium channel, and the channels do not REACTIVATE until the cell returns to being polarized once again. This inactivation is what limits the amount of calcium flux INTO the cell, which as mentioned in the other answer can be toxic to the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in brief... the ATP-sensitive potassium channels CLOSE, the cell depolarizes when it reaches the threshold potential for the voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Those calcium channels open, calcium flows into the cell and works with other machinery to cause insulin secretion. In the meantime, the calcium channels quickly inactivate and close. The basal ion pumps then return the membrane potential back to its resting state. This return to a polarized resting state allows the voltage-gated calcium channels to 'reset' or reactivate, and then the entire process can occur once again.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have simplified the explanation and left out some extraneous details - for more information about the specific types of channels see the references. <\/p>\n\n<p>References to Read More:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906950\" rel=\"nofollow\">Review discussing ATP-sensitive potassium channels and voltage gated calcium channels in insulin secretion.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(2) <a href=\"http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/er.2005-0888\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comprehensive review from the Endocrine Journal on insulin secretion, which discusses specifically both fast and slow calcium channels, inactivation and insulin secretion.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(3) <a href=\"http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/57/6/1618.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Review talking about voltage gated channels in insulin secretion from the journal Diabetes.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(4) <a href=\"http://www.intechopen.com/books/type-1-diabetes-pathogenesis-genetics-and-immunotherapy/beta-cell-function-and-failure-in-type-1-diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open access article with a heavily detailed figure of the beta cell.

Beetles are then usually pinned with a needle through the right elytra (wing cover), but there are also other ways to pin them. You can also glue the beetle to a piece of cardboard, which is then pinned.

A better way of saying it is that modern birds evolved <em>from<\/em> a particular type of dinosaur. That, however, is not the same as the blanket statement \"dinosaurs evolved to birds\". The latter implies that dinosaurs somehow morphed into birds and stopped being dinosaurs. What actually happens is that a species starts changing and, eventually, a sub-population of that species has changed so much that we call it a new species. It is a subtle distinction but important. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for a specific paper, no we don't have anything like that for any specific examples. What we have is a huge collection of observations all of which point to the process of speciation occurring via the processes of mutation and natural selection. It's impossible to know the precise series of mutations that led to the creation of a new species for a variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>All we have is the current species. If we know an ancestor, we can deduce a possible path that leads from the genome of the ancestor to the genome of the target species but we have no way of knowing whether that specific path was followed. For an analogy, consider computers. If I were to give you a modern desktop PC and one of the first computers:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QUWQzm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QUWQzm.jpg\" alt=\"old and new computers\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You might be able to guess certain changes that were made to the old ones in order to build something like the new ones but would you be able to figure out every single step along the way? How would you detect all the attempts that failed? The ideas that didn't pan out? Would you be able to infer the existence of floppy disks, for example? <\/p>\n\n<p>The same problem applies to species. It is essentially impossible to infer the precise series of mutations that led species B to split from species A.

As you alluded to in your question, there is one cell, or group of cells, that is part of the <strong>sinoatrial node<\/strong> (or SA node) that is referred to as the \"Pacemaker of the Heart\". It is these cells in the SA node that have the leakiest ion channels and thus most frequent spontaneous depolarizations that set the rate of contraction for the heart. <\/p>\n\n<p>For the cells in the atrium, the depolarization of the sinoatrial node spreads almost instantaneously across the atria because of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499977\" rel=\"nofollow\">gap junctions<\/a> (see that link for more info...Michela <em>et al.<\/em> Role of connexin 43 in cardiovascular diseases. European Journal of Pharmacology, 2015) between the cardiac myocytes. Gap junctions are small communicating junctions that link all the cells of the atrium and \"electrically-couple\" the cells to contract in synchrony. There are typically <strong>no<\/strong> gap junctions between the atria and the ventricles, which is why the atria contracts before the ventricles. However, there is the bundle of His that slows the electrical conduction just enough before it rapidly spreads through the purkinje fibers and then to the remaining ventricular myocytes through gap junctions in those cells as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>**For more information on gap junctions go to any basic cell biology text or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki<\/a>. The picture below is a simplified diagram of gap junctions. For this question all you really need to appreciate is that the electrical depolarization (i.e. the positive charge) spreads quickly across cells connected by gap junctions because they are 'sharing' a common cytoplasm due to these channels. When ions flux during depolarization that current flows through the gap junctions and nearly instantaneously depolarizes the next cell... and so on, and so forth.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8j4d.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8j4d.png\" alt=\"Gap Junction from Wikipedia page\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":40979,"question_id":40949,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40949/how-are-cardiac-cells-stimulated-by-an-action-potential","last_activity_date":1448423621,"creation_date":1448383901,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are cardiac cells stimulated by an action potential?","body":"<p>Why, and how, does the action potential of one cell in the heart stimulate an action potential in the next cell?

Hence, hormones can be readily cleared by the workhorse of blood clearance: <a href=\"http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=anatomy-and-function-of-the-liver-90-P03069\" rel=\"nofollow\">the liver<\/a>. For example, adrenaline is rapidly (<a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/578750_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">half life 5 - 10 minutes<\/a>) metabolized mainly by the liver, followed by excretion via the kidneys. Diffusion then will draw adrenaline away from the receptors as blood concentration drops. The relatively slow time course is beneficial, as the effects of epinephrine includes metabolic changes, such as the release of glucose to power up the body <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6380304\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Sherwin &amp; Saccà, 1984)<\/a>. This needs time.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In the synapse, there is no blood flow and inactivation has to occur through other means. Further, epinephrine in the above example is a fast acting hormone. Many hormones work on an even slower time frame. For example, a stress-induced cortisol peak can last for as long as an hour <a href=\"http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit0003.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Kirschbaum &amp; Hellhammer, 2000)<\/a>.

Ligands in biology and medicine can be all sorts of molecules, though most of the time we think of them as molecules that bind to a particular receptor. Those receptors can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel\">ion channels<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme\">enzymes<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein\">transmembrane receptors<\/a> at the cell surface or within the cell in an organelle, nuclear proteins that control expression of genes in the cell nucleus (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor\">transcription factors<\/a>), etc...the list could go on and on... In fact, more recently we have come to appreciate that compounds like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_acid\">bile acids<\/a> - that were previously thought to be important only in fat absorption in the gastrointestinal/digestive tract - are also ligands for receptors that control gene transcription (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500803482\">\"Farnesoid X Receptor\"<\/a>) as well as increase energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (through receptors like the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16400329\">\"TGR5\"<\/a> receptor).<\/p>\n\n<p>But... back to the question...<\/p>\n\n<p>If a molecule binds to a receptor, then it's a ligand for that receptor. The ligand doesn't have to donate any electrons specifically to a transition metal. Most of the time in medicine/biology the binding of a specific ligand to its receptor is a reversible process that is dependent on the concentration of the ligand and the availability of the receptor (among other things). The specificity of ligand for the receptor is due to chemical factors like hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions (like positive charges attracting negative charges), as well as other chemical interactions beyond the scope of this question. As you can see from the picture below, the hydroxy groups (-OH) that are part of the serine residues on the receptor are hydrogen bonding with the hydroxy groups on the epinephrine molecule itself. Moreover, the carboxy group (-COOH) on the aspartate residue is binding to the positively charged amino (NH3+) on the epinephrine molecule.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/i7Fp7.gif\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/i7Fp7.gif\" alt=\"Adrenaline (aka epinephrine) binding to its receptor - the adrenergic receptor\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":40945,"question_id":40840,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40840/how-is-adrenaline-a-ligand","last_activity_date":1448377528,"creation_date":1448107214,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is adrenaline a ligand?","body":"<p>I keep reading that adrenaline is a ligand, however from what I understand a ligand is a molecule or ion which donates a pair of electrons to a central transition metal ion in a complex.

The electroporators consumables are only the cuvettes, they cost 5-10 dollar/each. The gene guns use microbeads as bullets and depending on the material they cost between 200 and 300 dollars per microgram, 10-50 dollars per shot, a bit more expensive than electroporation.<\/p>\n\n<p>About the organisms, guns are used mostly for plant-cells and few other \"hard to electroporate\" organisms. I don'd have a proper list of them but roughly, if you work with bacteria, yeasts and mammalian cells, then go for an electroporator.\nIf you need to work with tissues or entire organisms like worm/insects/plants then go for a gun, you definitely cannot electroporate a leaf. But in general, check the literature on what is currently the best method to transfect your system of choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Efficacy, also in this case it depends form the cells you are working with.

The most common gene gun, the Helios model from Bio-Rad, is about $17000, including all the necessary parts. As you can see, a gene gun can be more expensive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, the gene gun needs bullets, which are microbeads (or microcarriers, as Bio-Rad calls them), and those cost around 600 dollars. The electroporation cuvettes each are $90. However, they can be cleaned and reused.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Target organism<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia, gene guns are used for mainly for transforming plant tissues, but is also used for animal tissues.

They have used it for yeast also. It has been also used for animal tissues, but it isn't the most suitable target organism. It seems better for in vitro systems since for most electroporation systems need the tissues or cells to be transfected in a cuvette.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Efficacy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For gene guns, the efficiency depends on the environment and the type of cells being used. The transfection efficiency varies for various cell types. I can't find many estimates for the efficiency of gene guns. But some of them are 10-20% of the DNA. Electroporation is agreed to have a very high efficiency. According to Wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Normal preparation of compentent cells can yield transformation efficiency ranging from 106 to 108 cfu/μg DNA. Protocols for chemical method however exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 1 x 109.[6] Electroporation method in general has better transformation efficiency than chemical methods with over 1 x 1010 cfu/μg DNA possible, and it allows large plasmids of 200 kb in size to be transformed.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ease of use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Both are very easy to use.

The process of photosynthesis depletes the chlorophyll in the leaves, so that needs to be replaced and this is a significant metabolic cost to the tree.  Therefore, whenever a tree is experiencing metabolic stress, it will slow down the chlorophyll replacement, and let the leaves die to save energy. It's metabolically cheaper to simply let the leaves die -- after removing the most precious nutrients -- and then regrow new leaves as needed, than to keep repairing the leaves that aren't needed because the tree is resting for other reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>In temperate areas, where there are well-defined seasons, this typically happens in the fall, and deciduous trees let their leaves die all at once in the fall.  In tropical or subtropical regions, where trees could photosynthesize all year, leaves may drop all year round (as with evergreen trees, like conifers, in temperate regions).  Often, though, their leaves will reflect metabolic stresses on the tree, such as drought. <\/p>\n\n<p>(The Wikipedia article on \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deciduous<\/a>\" makes the point that this can be very localized, related to very local environmental differences that could only affect a single tree.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Much of California is a subtropical region, and it has been experiencing severe drought for some time, so it wouldn't be surprising for a tree to have reached a point where its leaves have all had their chlorophyll removed.  On the other hand, as the El Nino event of 2015 increases, rainfall in California is returning, so it would also not be surprising for a tree to have recovered from drought enough to start making new leaves.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If your question is why the old leaves didn't fall off before the new ones started to regrow, it is probably simply a matter of timing.  The tree doesn't really \"care\" if the leaves fall or not, so long as they're not using up its resources, so there's no reason to force them off.  The new water supply may have arrived fairly shortly after the degree of drought that caused the tree to shut down the leaves.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":40808,"question_id":40776,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e680e1b996d90be5cedf4aba1c783514?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19803,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19803/zigmund","reputation":31,"display_name":"Zigmund"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1448336384,"creation_date":1448336384,"body":"<p>Depending on the part of California, most deciduous trees will go through the customary winter-dormancy cycle as is seen throughout the rest of the planet, albeit often majorly abbreviated.

NKG2D is such a receptor, and cells that are becoming transformatively stressed by mutations and the like upregulate expression of NKG2D ligands on their surface for elimination. This is one example, and NK cells have different subsets of activating receptors, such as NCRs. NKp30 and NKp44 are examples of NCRs and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19196184\" rel=\"nofollow\">activate NK cells through detection of heparan sulfate compounds on the surface of tumor cells<\/a>. The question, then, is what happens to cancer cells that can: (1) downregulate NK cell receptor ligands on their surface, or (2) abrogate NK cell receptor function in their vicinity?<\/p>\n\n<p>In an earlier study, it was shown that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951526\" rel=\"nofollow\">mesenchymal stem cells broadly inhibit NK cell activity<\/a> through activity of prostaglandin E2 and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, which downregulates each of the three aforementioned NK cell surface receptors. A later study using <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258454\" rel=\"nofollow\">melanoma cocultured with NK cells<\/a> again came to the conclusion that the same cancer cell secretions would inhibit NK cell activation in their vicinity. <\/p>\n\n<p>By the same token, if we consider a cancerous cell that upregulates MIC expression, NKG2D receptors will recognize this and activate the NK cells. A cancerous cell with a truncated MIC that lacks an extracellular domain will fail to activate surrounding NK cells through that pathway. Keep in mind: many mutations go into making a cell cancerous, and many more go into giving it enough fitness to avoid getting killed from the start. These are just examples of critical pathways that result in immunoevasion.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for why are small masses more immunoevasive than single cells? This goes into a sort of power in numbers logic. A single tumor cell doesn't produce as much inhibitor compounds as a mass of tumor cells. This is an interesting concept because in the hunt for pro-angiogenic compounds, a problem for a while was you would remove a large mass, and a smaller unknown mass would quickly begin to grow. They found that although large masses secreted more pro-angiogenic compound, the tumor cells also secreted so much inhibiting compounds that smaller tumors in the vicinity were effectively inhibited. Once the large mass was removed, this inhibition got lifted.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40932,"question_id":40929,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40929/natural-killer-cell-and-cancer","last_activity_date":1448323386,"creation_date":1448313633,"answer_count":1,"title":"Natural Killer Cell and Cancer","body":"<p>NK cells are very effective in destroying circulating cancer cells before their extravasation into the organ, However they have only a minimal inhibiting effect on already established micrometastases.\nAnyone knows why ?\nRegards.<\/p>\n","question_id":40929,"tags":["immunology","cancer"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a592159aa380c054cccb3a449a9ff27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8105,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8105/rover-eye","reputation":2003,"display_name":"Rover Eye"},"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40930/resources-for-similarity-between-embryos","last_activity_date":1448322060,"creation_date":1448313739,"answer_count":0,"title":"Resources for similarity between embryos","body":"<p>Is there a scientific paper/reputable image resource out there which I can use that the embryos of different organisms (vertebrata) are similar in their early developmental stages(without falling into the ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny trap) ? <\/p>\n\n<p>All I am able to find are the haeckel drawings or somethings that suspiciously look like haeckel drawings and after that debacle, I do not want to be using that. <\/p>\n","question_id":40930,"tags":["evolution","development","embryology","visualization"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1448322060},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":6,"post_id":34602,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432755481,"comment_id":55693,"body":"&quot;Support&quot; how?

Besides Dr. Knights article which is very focused on the issue and describes numerous benefits, there are other sources of research that show this can be good not only for the animals but also the community.  And specifically that this has worked in Namibia (where the black rhino was hunted) extremely well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Namibia has encouraged communities to see their local animals as resources to be protected and that they can profit from.  In cases of endangered species, the federal goverment abides by CITES and only allows so many to be killed. Other than that limitation communities are allowed to profit from their local animals both from trophy hunts but also tourism.  This has led to a reintroduction of many of these animals (endangered and not) onto private lands.  The survival and thrival of these animals is now an economic concern to the communities and land holders, and are protected as such.  This has worked for the recovery of many animals in Namibia.  In summary, the selling of a license to hunt one black rhino brings big profits to the community and therefore encourage the people to protect these resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CITES <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/res/all/13/E13-05R14C15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">articles<\/a> are also a good resource when looking at this.

Since it has been in operation the deer population has gone from nearly wiped out in the state to over half a million animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Flocken's arguments are based on fact but are really targeted at examples of bad wildlife management rather than against the practice of conservation hunting.

The bottom line is this:  the rangers were GOING TO KILLER THE RHINO ANYWAY.  The older male rhino was aggressive and actually killing other rhinos.  So, we have three scenarios:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leave the rhino, letting it kill several more rhinos.<\/li>\n<li>Have a park ranger kill the aggressive rhino (so that one rhino dies instead of many), which costs money.<\/li>\n<li>Kill the aggressive rhino (so that one rhino dies instead of many), but auction away the rights to someone willing to spend big money, which will go toward paying the park staff to protect the young rhinos that remain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>There are economic arguments in favor of this practice [1].  The idea of culling individuals to either maintain or increase a population is also derived from the idea of \"<a href=\"http://warnercnr.colostate.edu/~gwhite/fw662/web_docs/Lecture%207%20Compensatory%20mortality.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compensatory Mortality<\/a>\" and has been demonstrated for a variety of undulates [2][3][4][5][6].<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think the major flaw of any argument against this practice is the assumption that the rhino would not have been killed if there hadn't been an auction... The rhino was already on death row.  They marked it for culling because they wanted to preserve the maximum number of living, breedable rhinos...  It was only a matter of how to go about doing it, and I think they made the right choice by raising funds. <\/p>\n\n<p>P.S.  I don't hunt, and I love animals.  In fact, I was a little bummed about this story when I heard about it, but once I learned that the rhino was going to be killed anyway, I realized it's the best, most logical answer available.<\/p>\n\n<p>P.P.S.  Check out the Radio-Lab about this story [7].  They site that rhino populations rebounded following the creation of hunting ranches, because it gave a monetary value to the animals on ranchers' land, and they wanted to maintain that resource (by creating a breeding population).\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><\/p>\n\n<p>[1] Lindsey, P.A., Rouletb,P.A.,  Romañach,S.S. 2007.

In the story, he claims that the hunt was actually supporting conservation of the <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/black-rhino\">critically endangered<\/a> species, as they were looking to kill an older, non-reproducing male that was consuming resources and potentially threatening younger, breeding males. The Namibian government has a list of 18 rhinos in the country (out of a total population of about 2,000) that meet the criteria.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Knowlton is targeting one of four black rhinos at the top of the government list, the ones considered \"high priority threats to the herd.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Knowlton eventually caught up to and killed the animal he was targeting, and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/20/africa/namibia-rhino-hunt-meat/\">donated the meat<\/a> to a local village.<\/p>\n\n<p>CNN.com later published two opinion pieces, one <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/opinions/rhino-hunt-is-conservation/index.html\">in support of the hunt<\/a> by Dr. Mike Knight, the Chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission's African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) and the South African Development Community Rhino Management Group (SADC RMG), and one <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/opinions/trophy-hunting-not-conservation-flocken/\">opposed to it<\/a> by Jeffrey Flocken, the North America Regional Director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). Knight cites black rhino-specific data in his piece, arguing that in the case of this particular species, limited hunting is actually beneficial. Flocken instead uses a wider argument, citing hunting of polar bears, elephants, and lions, among other species, and claiming that the idea of \"conservation hunting\" as a whole is flawed. He does not, however, directly address the situation of black rhinos.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have evaluated each side's argument, but have not yet formed a solid opinion, which is why I'm asking here. In the specific case of the black rhino, does the science support the notion of limited elimination of older males? Are there studies that show this has led to an increase in other types of conservation efforts? Does the money spent for licenses actually go towards conservation and assistance for locals?<\/p>\n\n<p>As a second, optional question: Are the arguments posed by Flocken against \"conservation hunting\" in general supported by independent research? Just thinking logically I can imagine they are, as a lot of what he says makes sense in a broader context, if not necessarily in the case of the black rhino. Is there a scientific case for limited, situation-specific hunting, or should all forms of it be discouraged?<\/p>\n\n<p><sup><em>Note: I'm asking this here instead of Skeptics because I'm looking for a scientifically-supported answer.

Although several papers have reported activation\n  of the alternate pathway by heat-aggregated, denatured, or\n  recombinantly generated IgA, this seems to be essentially artifactual,\n  and intact native IgA antibodies complexed with antigen inhibit\n  complement activation induced by IgG or IgM antibodies. This\n  effect is also replicated by Fabα fragments generated by cleavage of\n  IgA1 antibodies with IgA1 protease. It is telling that mixed\n  aggregates of heat-denatured IgG and IgA activate the alternate\n  pathway in proportion to the content of IgG, and that C3b becomes\n  covalently linked to the IgG heavy chains, not to IgA. Intriguing\n  reports that IgA antibodies promote complement-dependent lysis or\n  opsonization of encapsulated bacteria probably also arise from\n  facilitation of alternate pathway activation by bacterial\n  polysaccharides<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It names three papers to underline this (which are number 45-47 in the reference list of the article), which can be found as references 3-5.

Every cell with nucleus splits up some of its intracellular protein to small chunks called oligopeptide (OP hereafter). So if there is an intracellular pathogen inside a cell, then its protein will be split up as well. After that the cell select the OPs it wants to show up on the surface. After an OP is selected, the cell binds it to a protein called MHC1 and sends it to the cell surface. So there is a lot of different MHC1-OP on the surface of every cell with nucleus. An immune cell group called T-cells are recognizing the MHC1 with their T-cell receptor (TCR hereafter). The TCR has a constant part and a variable part. The constant part depends on the species and person, it recognizes the MHC1. The variable part is random, it recognizes the OP. Each (not activated) T-cell has different variable part on the TCR on their surface, so each of them recognizes a different OP set. If a T-cell has strong binding to an intracellular pathogen's OP (IPOP hereafter), then it will be activated and it will destroy the cell infected with the pathogen. If a T-cell has only weak binding to an IPOP, or it recognizes an OP of a harmless own cell, then it won't be activated and it will die after a while, or in the second case it can become a regulator cell, which prevents autoimmune diseases. After the activation the T-cell start to proliferate, it divides many times and these clones try modify their receptor to bind even stronger to the selected IPOP, so they can find and destroy infected cells even more effectively. There is a mechanism in the immune system which prevents the activation of more than a few T-cells with different TCRs against the IPOPs of a single pathogen. So for example against a single pathogen there will be about a dozen different T-cell lines, which recognize a dozen IPOP. These IPOPs are the immunodominant peptides. Ofc. there can be IPOPs which are specific to the pathogen, but the T-cells which recognize them, are not or less activate.

More is brighter. (However, you already use a lot - using less may even be better because it would reduce background while still saturating the DNA with EtBr)<\/li>\n<li>Amount of DNA. More is brighter. To avoid guesswork, use a ladder and consult the instructions in its manual or spec sheet. They usually have an example picture of a gel, and say exactly how they obtained it.<\/li>\n<li>You messed up. Do other people in the lab get good gels? Ask them to do the protocol with you.<\/li>\n<li>Sample preparation. Are you using a loading dye in the correct amount? Is the DNA diffusing out of the wells? Are you spilling a lot of it when you load?<\/li>\n<li>Band width. Obviously if you load the same amount of DNA in a well 4 times as wide, it will be 4 times fainter.<\/li>\n<li>Strength of UV light. Many illuminators have a knob to adjust the intensity, people turn it down to avoid damaging DNA when gel-purifying restriction fragments. You can also play with intensity, gamma and exposure in a geldoc machine.<\/li>\n<li>Quality of EtBr. I've never actually had this happen, but your stock may be bad for some reason. Ask another lab for a ul or two to easily control for this.<\/li>\n<li>Quality of DNA. Obviously, your sample must actually have DNA in it, and not be degraded. You can check amount and purity easily with a spectrophotometer, but it will not tell you if the DNA has been digested into its component nucleotides (that is usually checked with a gel).<\/li>\n<li>Amount of gel. The crucial variable is obviously not total amount of EtBr, but concentration. Less gel, brighter bands - but you seem to be using a standard gel amount.<\/li>\n<li>Quality of gel.

For example, calcium is incorporated into the cell wall, so it is immobile; it cannot be relocated later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plants with a deficiency of mobile elements (<em>e.g.<\/em> nitrogen) will exhibit damage to older tissues as the nutrients are moved to new growth.  Conversely, plants lacking immobile elements (<em>e.g.<\/em> calcium) will exhibit stunted new growth while the older tissues stay healthy.  Some elements (<em>e.g.<\/em> sulphur) fall somewhere between these two extremes.<\/p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this concept, here is a plant with nitrogen deficiency (<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spitskool_stikstofgebrek_(nitrogen_deficiency)_Brassica_oleracea_convar._capitata_var._alba.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a>).  Notice how the older leaves are dying while the newer leaves are relatively normal.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dhc3m.jpg\" alt=\"Brassica oleracea with nitrogen deficiency\"><\/p>\n\n<h3>Is there an official list of mobile and immobile elements?<\/h3>\n\n<p>No.  You will probably have to survey the literature yourself to come up with such a list.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Why are some elements not mentioned in the sources?<\/h3>\n\n<p>Elements like Pb or Sr do not appear in either list because plants generally do not use these elements at all.  Only a few elements are present in any appreciable quantity in plants.  The main elements used are C, H, O, P, K, N, S, Ca, Fe, and Mg. Additionally, some other elements such as Cu, Mo, Al, and Cl are used in trace amounts as enzymatic cofactors.  Si is used for structural purposes in some plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, even for \"useless\" elements, it is possible to study how these elements are absorbed transported through a given plant.  For instance, Rediske and Selders (1953) studied the absorption of strontium by bean plants using radioactive labeling, and concluded that the element was not relocated once absorbed by the plant.  This would make it an immobile element.<\/p>\n\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Feldman, Lewis J.

Generally, what is called an \"acquired trait\" does not fit that criterion. What's passed on is the genetic material of the parents and that doesn't change when the parent acquires these traits. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, bonsai trees are kept small by environmental conditions, as such, their height could be called an acquired trait. Their offspring does not naturally grow as a bonsai tree. Giraffes did not grow longer necks because they stretched them, but because those giraffe ancestors with longer necks (which just happens randomly through mutation - you have varying neck lengths in a population) could reach food more easily and could survive when those with shorter necks didn't. The giraffe example is a classic one that was proposed by <em>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck<\/em>, whose theory of evolution (called Lamarckism) was superceded by Darwin's. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are traits where acquired versus genetic traits are hard to differentiate - while a good athlete does not have children who are athletic because their parent did sports, they are often also good athletes. For one thing, the parent might be genetically \"suited\" for sports and has passed these genes on. Another reason is that they will probably train their children and want them to become more athletic. <\/p>\n\n<p>I know of one example where something that could be called an acquired trait is passed on to offspring - <em>methylation patterns<\/em>. Those are modifications of the genetic material that happen during an organism's lifespan and aren't modifications of the actual genetic code - they can be passed on to offspring. Since these patterns influence gene expression, they have an effect on the offspring.

They have important roles in the development, growth, and maintenance of the organism. Proto-oncogene is an accurate description of the genes, but I unfortunately think that sometimes people think that the genes themselves are bad and that isn't the case.<\/p>\n\n<p>Growth and development in multicellular organisms are highly regulated processes with many checks and balances. Certain cells need to grow in certain places at certain times, and then they need to go into and remain in interphase. If they don't, or they do things at the incorrect times, the multicellular organism will not develop properly or will develop conditions such as cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is often these points of regulation that become dysregulated when a proto-oncogene becomes oncogenic. If there are regions of allostery that are affected by a mutation in the coding sequence (exon) and a control molecule that represses the activity of the enzyme through conformation change can no longer bind, then that enzyme can remain active, always turned on. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can also have a situation where you have transcriptional regulators of proto-oncogenes that can be effected making the gene product oncogenic. If there is a mutation in an enhancer (intronic) of the gene that affects the binding kinetics of enhancers leading to a great increase in transcription, this concentrational difference can lead to uncontrolled grown and tumor formation.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You could also have a situation like MattDMo talked about where you generate frameshifts and premature stop codons, though I would think this is more relevant in tumor suppressor gene mutations, as these types of mutations tend to kill the protein rather quickly, but it is possible that it can cause a problem.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>RAS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are however other types of mutations that can effect proto-oncogenes, making them oncogenic. One classic example is RAS. RAS is a G-protein that associates with G-Protein Coupled Receptors at the cell surface and transduce signals into the cell leading to the initiation of the cell cycle. In its inactive form, RAS is bound to GDP. When a signaling molecule binds to the plasma membrane receptor it is associated with the RAS molecule, a Guanosine-Exchange Factor removes the bound GDP, and because of concentration, GTP enters the binding pocket and activates RAS, which activates a phosphorylation cascade, leading to transcription of growth factors. <\/p>\n\n<p>Normally RAS has GTPase activity and will quickly cleave the gamma phosphate of the GTP in its binding pocket, leading to GDP and inactivating itself. However if the mutation were to knock out this GTPase activity from RAS, then it would have no way to cleave the Gamma phosphate, and therefore it would remain activated and continue the signal transduction, even when it should not.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the problem does not need to be with RAS to drive RAS to oncogenesis. If RAS GEF becomes hyperactive and starts to exchange GDP for GTP constitutively, whether or not there is a signal, then RAS will constantly be activated, even if it is still able to cleave the Gamma phosphate and inactivate itself. So there can be Cis-acting drivers of oncogenesis and Trans-acting drivers as well.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am providing you a link to Scitable's page on <strong><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/proto-oncogenes-to-oncogenes-to-cancer-883\">Proto-oncogenes to Oncogenes to Cancer<\/a>.<\/strong> It gives the following summary which is a helpful summary:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Point mutations, deletions, or insertions that lead to a hyperactive\n  gene product<\/li>\n  <li>Point mutations, deletions, or insertions in the promoter region of a proto-oncogene that lead to increased transcription<\/li>\n  <li>Gene amplification events leading to extra chromosomal copies of a proto-oncogene<\/li>\n  <li>Chromosomal translocation events that relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression<\/li>\n  <li>Chromosomal translocations that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a second gene, which produces a fusion protein with oncogenic activity<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":40859,"question_id":40853,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1448148899}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40853/question-about-proto-oncogenes-and-oncogenes","last_activity_date":1448149469,"creation_date":1448139939,"answer_count":2,"title":"Question about proto-oncogenes and oncogenes?","body":"<p>My textbook says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Growth-promoting genes are called proto-oncogenes.

Had to do some math. With our 4 nucleotide system, the number of possible codons is 4<sup>3<\/sup> = 64. That is number of nucleotides to the codon length power. The question asks us to determine codon length while giving us the number of amino acids and an upper limit on tRNAs. Using the same formula, <pre> #Nucleotides<sup>(Codon-Length)<\/sup> = #Codons,<\/pre> we must find a combination of nucleotide number and codon length that gives between 20 and 40 codons.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>                               Codon Length\nNucleotides    1         2        3        4        5\n     2         2         4        8        16       32\n     3         3         9        27       81       243\n     4         4         16       64       256      1024\n     5         5         25       125      625      3125\n     6         6         36       216      1296     7776\n     7         7         49       343      2401     16807\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>So using this table we see that a few different combinations of Nucleotide number and codon length will fit in that range.

A 5-base system can work with 2 base codons. A 6-base system can also work with 2-base codons. 7 or more bases fails because even a 2-base codon will make more than 40 codons.<\/p>\n\n<p>A codon length of 1 nucleotide would require at least 20 nucleotides, so it would not be a good answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>5 is probably the correct answer because it works with the shortest codon length, though I don't know how you'd get base pairing with an odd number of bases. Perhaps the 5th base pairs with itself. A 6 base system can also work with the same codon length and wouldn't need a self pairing base.

Citing <a href=\"http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/cancer-basics/genetics/genetics-cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\">cancer.net<\/a>, here is some information on the genetics of cancer:<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Many of the genes that contribute to the development of cancer fall into broad categories:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tumor suppressor genes are protective genes. Normally, they limit cell growth by monitoring how quickly cells divide into new cells, repairing mismatched DNA, and controlling when a cell dies. When a tumor suppressor gene is mutated, cells grow uncontrollably and may eventually form a mass called a tumor. BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 are examples of tumor suppressor genes. Germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancers. The most commonly mutated gene in people who have cancer is p53. In fact, more than 50% of all cancers involve a missing or damaged p53 gene. Most p53 gene mutations are acquired mutations. Germline p53 mutations are rare.<\/li>\n<li>Oncogenes turn a healthy cell into a cancerous cell. Mutations in these genes are not inherited. Two common oncogenes are:\n\n<ul>\n<li>HER2, which is a specialized protein that controls cancer growth and spread, and it is found on some cancer cells, such as breast and ovarian cancer cells<\/li>\n<li>The ras family of genes, which make proteins involved in cell communication pathways, cell growth, and cell death.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>DNA repair genes fix mistakes made when DNA is copied. But if a person has an error in a DNA repair gene, these mistakes are not corrected. And then they become mutations, which may eventually lead to cancer. This is especially true if the mutation occurs in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene. Mutations in DNA repair genes can be inherited, such as with Lynch syndrome, or acquired.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Somatic Evolution in cancer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A cancer is a group of cells that proliferate. In other words a cancer is a group of cells having a higher fitness than other cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_evolution_in_cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia > Somatic Evolution in cancer<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can a cancer be beneficial?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I am here attempting to answer your specific question.<\/p>\n\n<p>We define a cancer based on the fact that it is detrimental to the organism carrying it. If a group of cells divide a lot more than the others and this is beneficial to the organism, then it is not a cancer but an adaptive developmental process.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Let's generalize the definition of cancer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To generalize the definition of cancer, one can say that a cancer is a group of individuals that proliferate to the detriment of the group. In other words, we need a social group of individuals (such as a multicellular organism) to get a cancer. Depending on your definition of a social group, one could consider a criminal organization as a cancer to human society.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you push the definition a little further by either leaving out the need of a close phylogenetic relatedness between individuals of the group, one could say that \"humans are a cancer of the earth\".

In general terms, you're right that cancer is unregulated cell division, which hijacks the mechanism of cell division which is ancestral to all multicellular life.  In early multicellular life, it may well be the case that faster reproduction was selected for, while it has been selected against for most organisms as they became more complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mutations which cause tumors are usually two-fold: first there is a mutation which causes a cell to get genetically switched on.  This might be a mutation causing an overproduction of a protein signalling molecule which tells the cell it is time to grow.  The second is usually a mutation in cancer prevention genes, since a cell going haywire is likely to be spotted and destroyed relatively quickly.  If both of these mutations happen in the same cell, the cell can form a tumor (and if the tumor spreads to other parts of the body, it is called cancer).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Some people have suggested that cancer be thought of as \"cell-level selection.\"  This idea of levels of selection takes a little explanation.  When evolution was first proposed (and the way in which it is introduced still) is individual-level selection.  Individuals compete against other individuals to survive and reproduce.  However George C. Williams suggested (and Dawkins later popularized in \"The Selfish Gene\") that genes might compete against other genes.  This is called the gene-level view.  In the mid 1980s, Leo Buss suggested that a cell might also be a level of selection, and that cancer represented cells trying to reproduce at the expense of the individual which carried them.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In some cases, such as instances of transmissible tumors (there are only a few such tumors known in the wild, none in humans).  These cancers spread from individual to individual, rather than just within one individual.  In that way, the cancer's evolutionary strategy was successful.  However these are rare, so if we view cancer as an evolutionary strategy, it is not usually a successful one.  As such, thinking of cancer as a cell-level selection has not yielded many interesting ideas so it is not widely used in biology today.  It is not incorrect, but it doesn't further many research projects so it is not commonly taught or studied.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's one exception to that, however.  Thinking of cancer itself as an evolutionary process, where cells survive and die off according to their mutations, is very useful to understanding the progression of a tumor.

The answer is that, in general, there is a higher rate of mutation in spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis. This is because there are more cell divisions during spermatogenesis, which allows for opportunities for mutation. <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, repeat diseases like Huntington\u2019s sometimes have a phenomenon known as anticipation. This is when the disease gets phenotypically (and genetically) more severe with each successive generation. The exact molecular basis of this is not completely understood, but it is just well known that DNA polymerase tends to make more mistakes in large repeat regions, causing an expansion of the repeat. Anticipation is not linked to gender, I just wanted to point out that these repeats are prone to mutations that will expand the repeat and cause disease<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see anticipation in this graph. This example is for Fragile X. The higher the repeat number in the parent, the greater the chance the child develops the disease. The parent doesnt have the disease, but what happens is the repeat mutates and gets expanded to the point where the disease will develop.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nmcSV.gif\" alt=\"Anticipation\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So, put these two facts together and you have your answer.
