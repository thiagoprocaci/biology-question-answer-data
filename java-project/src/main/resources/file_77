This is a reason why I don't directly address my below answer in the terms of the question as it seems that the OP uses a unusual definition of the term \"evolution\". @Chris comment (\"No, it doesn't. Evolution is a statistical process which is not influenced by any means of intelligence\") probably sums up what the OP needed to read but I can't stand but giving a more complete answer about why is intelligence just a random trait and in the meantime arguing in a far-fetched text that intelligence still has actually some funny properties as it may yield to social help (social help does not necessarily needs intelligence) and eugenics programs (that might be argued that it doesn't need intelligence as well).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of the answer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligence (as many other traits) influences fitness<\/li>\n<li>Intelligence (as many other traits) influence the environment that individuals are facing influencing then future evolution<\/li>\n<li>Evolution is not dependent on the will of the individuals in the population.<\/li>\n<li>Indirectly, intelligence may be of some particular interest as it yields to knowledge about physiology and evolution allowing Eugenic program and medicine which both influence future evolution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Long answer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Fitness<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Intelligence influence fitness (=reproductive success). So yes it plays a role in evolution just like any other trait that influence fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Environment<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Intelligence evolves and by its presence it will change future evolution as it changes the environment the individual faces. For example, if a bird is intelligent enough to bottle milk bottle, it might over the long term (and assuming that humans are not inventing some solutions to prevent birds from opening their bottles) evolve longer beak to seek for milk from the bottle. Also Intelligence shape culture (set of traditions). Theoretically, all traits does the exact same thing, so again there is nothing so exceptional about intelligence.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a subset of the impact of intelligence on the environment the individual experience: Intelligence allow culture which changes through time and it is some kind of evolution called memetics. Again, culture changes the environment the individual faces and if culture changes often because of high intelligence, then the environment may change quickly as well.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>General basic comment on evolution<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It is very important to not think that intelligence will allow a population to \"better evolve\". Being intelligent does not yield to higher probability of adaptable evolution. It is not because you know what issue you're facing that you'll be consciously able to evolve to that. For adaptation to occur you have to select individuals that are more fit in the population. If individuals in the population know who are fit doesn't mean that those fit individuals will be more selected than otherwise.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Social help and eugenic programs<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the previous paragraph I must point to some potential, indirect impacts of intelligence on the evolution of a population. A population of intelligent individuals may as a group decide on which individuals will reproduce. This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics\" rel=\"nofollow\">eugenics<\/a> and this is the kind of process by which intelligence influence future evolution in a particularly interesting and unique way. For example, we may decide that all people that carry a non-expressed disease gene are not allowed to reproduce in order to suppress this gene from the population. In the same order of idea the population learn how to treat people that have a given genetic disease, the selection against the gene variants (alleles) causing the disease will decrease, increasing then the frequency of the disease in the population. Therefore, some medical actions (and other kind of social help) cause less adaptable evolution while some eugenic program cause more adaptable evolution. <em>I am not talking about ethics here and am not saying we SHOULD stop treating people with genetic disease<\/em>. Note that other things like the evolution of trait architecture will yield to different ability to undergoes adaptive evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Interpreting my answer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is important for a starter in evolutionary theory to make sure to learn more about evolution before trying to interpret further this answer in an incorrect way. I want to avoid that someone with few knowledge in evolution starts to think that intelligence is some kind of magical trait or that evolution is a process answering to the conscious needs individuals may have. For the moment keep in mind that evolution has no foresight and is not the result of the will of the individuals in the population (except for eugenic program). Behind this answer there are (maybe hidden) slightly advanced topics such as the strength of selection, mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, the genetic load, trait architecture and evolvability.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21124,"question_id":21110,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1410217557},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/67b588ca896693bf58fa04dc13917d1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9155,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9155/dan-bryant","reputation":133,"display_name":"Dan Bryant"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1410210263,"creation_date":1410210263,"body":"<p>Intelligence can have an impact on selection, but keep in mind that flexible intelligence (like the kind humans possess) is a high-cost/high-reward kind of adaptation.

For example, <em>Toxoplasma<\/em> is a parasite use rats and cats as hosts. <em>Toxoplasma<\/em> alters the behavior of the rats so that they no longer respond to the smell of a cat. That makes the rats much more likely to be captured by the cats, which transfers the parasite to the cat from the rat <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690701/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Berdoy et al. 2000)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8\" rel=\"nofollow\">This YouTube video<\/a> shows how a fungal parasite of ants alters the ant behavior to help the fungus reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>My favorite example, which I use in my introductory biology course, is <a href=\"http://bio390parasitology.blogspot.com/2012/02/euhalplorchis-californiensis_07.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Euhaplorchis californiensis<\/em><\/a>, a parasitic fluke. The parasite lives in marshy habitats, such as <a href=\"http://carpinteria.ucnrs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carpinteria Marsh<\/a> in California, USA. This parasite uses wading birds (herons and egrets), a snail and a fish as it's host.  The adult lives in the gut of the wading birds. Eggs from the adults pass out with the bird feces. Horn snails consume the fecal material and the eggs.  The eggs hatch inside the snail. The larvae actually castrate the snails so that the snails cannot reproduce. Instead, the snails only feed, which provides nutrients for the parasite larvae. The larvae then leave the snail and swim into the marsh, where they are consumed by the California killifish (<em>Fundulus parvipinnis<\/em>). The parasite works its way from the gut of the fish to the brain, where it releases chemicals that alter the behavior of the killifish. Normally, if a killifish sees a wading bird, it would dive deep. Instead, the parasitized fishes no longer dive. They remain near the surface and swim eratically. This behavior makes it much easier for the wading bird to see and catch the killifish. The parasite is transfered back to the wading bird, and its life cycle begins again. Details of this fascinating life cycle can be found in (<a href=\"http://parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/pubs/Shaw%20et%20al.%202010%20JP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shaw et al. 2010<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is possible that the behavior of the dorbeetles is being influenced by an internal parasite. These <a href=\"http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/wildlife/other-notable-insects/dung-beetles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dung beetles<\/a> may consume a parasite when they ingest dung from a certain species. The parasite could alter the behavior of the beetle making them more vulnerable to a particular predator, thereby continuing the next step of the parasite's life cycle. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your description of the beetle behavior would fit this hypothesis but I stress that I do not know this.

There probably are no perfectly fisherian populations in nature!<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genetic drift<\/a> causes a decrease in heterogeneity. As the genetic drift is a function of the population size (see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a>) this decrease of heterogeneity is a function of the population size. The heterogeneity at time $t$ is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ H_t = H_{0}\\left( 1-\\frac{1}{2N} \\right)^t$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>, where $H_0$ is the heterogeneity at $t=0$. You can verify by yourself that as $t$ increase , $H_t$ decreases. Also, as $N$ decreases, $H_t$ decreases. In other words, the longer you observe, the more heterogeneity gets lost and the smaller is the population, the higher is the loss of heterogeneity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Effective Population Size<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Let <code>Pop_A<\/code> be a real population. The effective population size ($Ne$) of <code>Pop_A<\/code> is the size of an idealized fisherian population that would have the same loss of heterogeneity than <code>Pop_A<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read the above sentence twice to make sure you understand it. It basically is the definition of the concept of effective population size.<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words: Let $N$ be the population size of <code>Pop_A<\/code>. If <code>Pop_A<\/code> is a perfect fisherian population, then its loss of heterozygosity through time is given by:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ H_t = H_{0}\\left( 1-\\frac{1}{2N} \\right)^t$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>If <code>Pop_A<\/code> is not a perfect fisherian population, then it's decrease in heterozygosity is greater than the one given by the above formula. The decrease in heterozygosity of <code>Pop_A<\/code> corresponds to the decrease of heterozygosity of an idealize fisherian population of a different size. This size is called the effective population size $Ne$. So, we can rewrite the loss of heterogosity through time of <code>Pop_A<\/code> as:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ H_t = H_{0}\\left( 1-\\frac{1}{2Ne} \\right)^t$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>(Note $N$ has been replaced by $Ne$)<\/p>\n\n<p>, where $Ne$ is the effective population size of <code>Pop_A<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually $Ne &lt; N$, meaning that a real population undergoes more genetic drift than does a fisherian population of the same census size. There are many reasons that may yield a real population to have a higher drift than it would be expected with the same census size but respecting the assumptions of the fisherian population. Below I discuss three reasons:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Unequal sex-ratio<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Think as a first example of a population where the sex-ratio is extremely biased to the point of having one male for 99 females. In such population, half of the alleles of a given locus at the next generation will come directly from the father. In such situations, the genetic drift is much higher than what would be expected from a fisherian population of size 100. Therefore $Ne&lt;N=100$. To calculate $Ne$ when the sex-ratio in unequal you can use this formula:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$Ne=\\frac{4N_mN_f}{N_m+N_f}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>, where $N_m$ and $N_f$ are the census populatino size of males and females respectively. You can verify that when $N_f = N_m$, then $N_f + N_m = N = Ne$.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Variation in population size through time<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>If your population size varies throughout a given time (a year for example) and that at time $t=3$ (a given period of the year) the census population size is given by $N_i$, then the effective population size is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$Ne = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{i=1}^t\\frac{1}{N_i}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>This is particularly relevant for insects for example which population size varies a lot between seasons.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Selection<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Think now of a population where there is a great variance in fitness (there is selection). In such population, maybe all offspring will be produced by only a tenth of the current population.

In a very simple sense, you can think of the effective population size as the number of reproducing (breeding) individuals in a population. Nature Education has a very good (and free) Scitable article on <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-drift-and-effective-population-size-772523\">Genetic Drift and Effective Population Size<\/a>. The article makes four points, which I've annotated below.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The population has an equal number of males and females. All\nindividuals are able to reproduce.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Populations of many species contain individuals that have not yet reached sexual maturity, have passed an age of reproductive capability, or might have a genetic condition that prevents reproduction.  All of these individuals count towards the census population size (actual number of individuals present) but not count towards effective population size because they can't reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>All individuals in the population are equally likely to reproduce. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Mating is random.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Not all indivduals (assuming individuals that meet assumption #1 above) are equally likely to reproduce. For example, the process of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/sexual-selection-13255240\">sexual selection<\/a> means that some individuals are much more likely to reproduce than other individuals. Sexual selection is not random, and lowers effective population size. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The number of breeding individuals is constant from one generation to\nthe next.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Population sizes for some species can fluctuate over many generations. For example, freshwater mussels have declined rapidly in population size due to habitat loss and other factors. Nearly 72% of the species in the United State and Canada are endangered, threatened or of conservation concern (<a href=\"http://fishwild.vt.edu/mussel/PDFfiles/Conservation_status.pdf\">Williams et al. 1993<\/a>). The population sizes for the majority of mussels species are but a fraction of what they once were. This is the case for many endangered species. This too lowers effective population size.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a simple mathematical treatment to highlight points 1-3. Consider a population of zebras. Zebras like the Plains Zebra (<em>Equus quagga<\/em>) form harems where one male mates with several females. He prevents other males from mating with the females in his harem. Let's make the following assumptions: 1) the population has 250 males and 250 females, all capable of breeding and 2) each male that is able to form a harem gets five females. If so, then only 50 males will actually get to reproduce. The census size is 500 individuals but the effective population size, as shown in Remi.b's answer, is calculate by<\/p>\n\n<p>$$N_e = \\frac{4N_m N_f}{N_m+N_F}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where, $N_e$ is the effective population size, $N_m$ is the number of breeding males and $N_f$ is the number of breeding females. Given assumptions 1 and 2 above, $N_m$ is 50 and $N_f$ is 250 (50 males $\\times$ 5 females each). Therefore,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$N_e = \\frac{4\\times 50 \\times 250}{50 + 250} = 166.67$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the effective population size is much smaller than the census population size.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21106,"question_id":21102,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1410134073}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21102/definition-of-effective-population-size","last_activity_date":1410173559,"creation_date":1410128064,"answer_count":2,"title":"Definition of \"Effective population size\"","body":"<p>Could you explain to me, what is the meaning of \"<em>Effective population size ($N_e$)<\/em>\"?<\/p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate an example as well.<\/p>\n","question_id":21102,"tags":["population-genetics"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":21106,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2437,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1410173559},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3d07e61c02849ac032f10f1fbb0d073?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9045,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9045/ayush-madan","reputation":28,"display_name":"Ayush Madan"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":21112,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410164443,"comment_id":33102,"body":"Have you read the article in the Wikipedia about it? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance<\/a> Do you have specific questions about it?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3d07e61c02849ac032f10f1fbb0d073?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9045,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9045/ayush-madan","reputation":28,"display_name":"Ayush Madan"},"score":0,"post_id":21112,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1410164782,"comment_id":33104,"body":"Yes I did but I still couldn&#39;t get a clear picture of it in my head."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3d07e61c02849ac032f10f1fbb0d073?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9045,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9045/ayush-madan","reputation":28,"display_name":"Ayush Madan"},"score":0,"post_id":21112,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1410164884,"comment_id":33105,"body":"Would you happen to know another site with a clearer definition?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":21112,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410165006,"comment_id":33106,"body":"Can you tell us what you find unclear in this definition?

They wanted to identify DNA sequences in the genome of Lodgepole pine  (<em>Pinus contorta<\/em>) and rice (<em>Oryiza sativa<\/em>). To accomplish this goal, they used degeneracy alignment. Here's the relevant section from their methods:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>altered to allow searches against genomic sequence. Alignments were kept if they were no shorter than L − 3, where L is the query sequence length. No more than a total of three mismatches or insertions/deletions were allowed within the aligned region.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Their approach was to find genomic sequences that correspond to the small RNAs. They allowed for some degeneracy, either in the genome or the RNA. The sequences could differ in length by no than three nucleotides or mismatches (an A in the query sequence but a C in the target sequence instead of a T; I'm assuming the query is RNA and the target is the genomic DNA). Their degeneracy alignment allowed for a small amount of freedom in identifying potential matches of conserved RNA clusters (high similarity) in the genomes of distantly related plant species. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Morin, R.D. et al. 2008.

The fluorescently labeled target when bound to the probe can then be detected using a scanning laser. <\/p>\n","answer_id":21074,"question_id":21067,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1410026385}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21067/microarray-probe-and-target","last_activity_date":1410026385,"creation_date":1409981637,"answer_count":1,"title":"Microarray probe and target","body":"<p>In a microarray, which one is called a target and which one is the probe? the one that is added later , is that the probe or the one present in the slots of the microarray, that is the probe?<br>\n(I have not studied biology since last 8 years and now I am going through it because I need it for my research.

However, this might be more appropriate for chemistry, and will move it if I have to.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question has to do with the Poly A tails on mRNA. I've been doing in vitro transcription and tailing for a while now and have noticed that the untailed RNA has a 260/280 of about 2.0, like you'd expect, but successful tailing results in ratios from 2.15 to 2.45, with higher ratios correlating to better band shifts on agarose gels, implying a longer tail. I suspect the reason for this is because the adenine has a much higher 260/280 than the other bases, so if you add a lot of adenines to the 3' end of the RNA you add much more 260 absorbance than 280 absorbance.<\/p>\n\n<p>After seeing this I tried to come up with a mathematical method to estimate tail length based on 260/280, since gels are annoying, while I can get the ratio directly from the nanodrop.<\/p>\n\n<p>I started by using the 260/280 for each nucleotide, A: 4.50, G: 1.15, C: 1.51, U: 4.00, T: 1.47 source here: <a href=\"http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/gcat/protocols/NanoDrop_tip.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>. I then took the sequence for the Luciferase gene I'm using for mRNA and counted the nucleotides, 449 A, 566 C, 470 G, 374 U. I tried to get the weighted average of the 260/280 for my RNA. <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>A: 449 x 4.50 = 2020.50\nC: 566 x 1.51 =  854.60\nG: 470 x 1.15 =  540.50\nU: 374 x 4.00 = 1496.00\nSum:            4911.60\n\nNucleotides: 449 + 566 + 470 + 374 = 1859\nSum / Nucleotides : 4911.60 / 1859 = 2.64\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>2.64 is clearly not 2.0. Even accounting for the potential effect of pH and ionic strength on RNA 260/280 ( acidic solutions have lower ratios ) I can't explain why the calculated ratio is so high. Even if we assumed an RNA with 25% of each base, the weighted average is still (1.15 + 4.50 + 1.51 + 4.00)/4 = 2.79, even higher than for my real sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Doing the same calculation for DNA, (1.15 + 4.50 + 1.51 + 1.47)/4 = 2.16.<\/p>\n\n<p>So why don't my calculated ratios for RNA and DNA 260/280 match the \"ideal\" ratios of 2.0 and 1.8?<\/p>\n","question_id":21039,"tags":["rna","lab-techniques","dna-isolation"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":189,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3362"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3362"},"score":0,"post_id":21034,"edited":false,"creation_date":1409875195,"comment_id":32967,"body":"It would be good if you could flesh out the answer with an explanation for this: when cold, does it reduce the general circulation levels from the extremities being very cold, or does it actually increase it (even if slightly) due to the &#39;need&#39; for the extremities/core to be heated more?

It is a way we would like to find and explain phenomena, given pen and paper.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often, scientists build models in order to explain data in hand, but even then, they will have to add something from their imagination. For example, early astronomers saw planets moving differently from stars, and came up with the idea that, you know, planets do not circle the earth, but maybe around some points in space, which in turn circle the earth. That didn't work well, so they created the heliocentric model, where planets and the Earth circled the sun. That was still perfectible, and Newton suggested the planets do not move on circles, but on ellipses. Each generation of astronomers had almost the same data in hand, but chose to make some assumptions in their models.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same goes with the lack of interaction between potassium and sodium ions: it is a theoretical assumption. As models go, the GHK model is quite good, because it fits experimental findings better than any other model. Its assumptions have a great chance of being true, of reflecting the physical world. I guess you really asked what are the physical facts that underlie the assumption of ion independence. The fact is, you are looking for explanations for a fact that may be or may not be - so any response you will receive is, to a degree, speculation.<\/p>\n\n<p>My thought is that the number of water molecules (55 molar) that may collide with an ion is far greater than the number of cations (up to a few hundred nanomolar, about 100 million rarer). Perhaps the number of ion-ion collisions is negligible. There is one bottleneck, in the actual channels, but there different species do not meet, because each has its own channels.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another, more factual, is that the model is imperfect, and independence is more of a wish than a complete truth.

I'll give a quick basic answer just from the top of my head and hopefully someone can give some specific examples in birds.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bias in gamete production<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming XY chromosome systems where the males are heterogametic (XY, females XX) the male can influence the brood sex ratio by producing more or less Y-bearing sperm. Sperm carrying an X-chromosome will always produce daughters and sperm carrying a Y- will always produce sons. The opposite would be true for ZZ/ZW where female gamete type determines the sex, they could only produce Z eggs, therefore only having sons.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Female cryptic sperm choice<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A fairly modern idea is that females can selectively fertilise eggs with sperm based on the DNA they carry, this could include whether the sperm is Y- or X-bearing. This idea is thought to explain how females produce daughters from small sires and sons from large sires in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15009280\" rel=\"nofollow\">the paper I mentioned at the start.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Meiotic drive and sex ratio distorters<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Meiotic drive elements may be responsible for sex-ratio distortion in broods. Just like the biased sperm production this can alter the sex-ratio at the gamete level. Genetic effects mean that fewer offspring of one sex than the other are produced. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/23/13183\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is one example where suppressors of the distorter have evolved in the autosomes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Direct selection by the parents<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In the paper you mention above, and with most studies, it is possible that the parents are selecting which offspring to raise after they hatch (or as an egg - it may be possible to determine sex at that point) and if females are more costly to raise and conditions are poor, they may kill/neglect the female offspring early on.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Within brood competition<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>If one sex is stronger as a chick it possible that the broods could become sex biased in certain conditions which consistently favour one over the other.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Consequence of environmental strain<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly to the last two points, if conditions are poor it may be harder for one sex to reach maturity than the other which would result in sex-bias.

But there is no evidence as of now regarding Mitochondrial DNA taking part in inhibitory and excitatory systems. so, epileptic seizures are not specific in inheriting from any side (Maternal or paternal side) as far as pathophysiology of epilepsy is concerned.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21009,"question_id":20974,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20974/is-epilepsy-more-heritable-from-maternal-side","last_activity_date":1409817115,"creation_date":1409730004,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is epilepsy more heritable from maternal side?","body":"<p>I am thinking if paternal or maternal genetic line is the risk factor. \nMitochondrial DNA is coming from maternal line. \nI do not know the pathogenesis of epilepsy so well that I could answer my question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is epilepsy more heritable from the maternal side?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":20974,"tags":["genetics"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1409731721},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1391294090,"creation_date":1391294090,"body":"<p>I think one reason for greater virulence is the fact that M.tuberculosis <strong>prevents fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think this picture is little relevant here<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zbfJ0.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I am thinking what is happening in these two parts here:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dKH3R.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This answer does not provide enough support why there is greater virulance in HIV patients than in normal people.\nAnd particularly why the preventation of the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes leads to it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14774,"question_id":14773,"up_vote_count":1,"community_owned_date":1391294090},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07d542a58ef9867b4ac2309ecdac3d2e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3631,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3631/chinmay-kanchi","reputation":919,"display_name":"Chinmay Kanchi"},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":0,"post_id":14822,"edited":false,"creation_date":1391502165,"comment_id":19813,"body":"Thank you very much for your answer!

There will be one link on the returned page in the format of <code>http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?gl:G#####<\/code>, where G##### is your glycan number (in our example G00021).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have the glycan number you're good to go.  All of the structure images can be found at:\n<code>http://www.genome.jp/Fig/glycan/G#####.gif<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>And then you just download your GIF.

Cooking with Teflon influences how you cook, and it's how you cook that has the greatest effect on the levels of carcinogens in food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cooked food contains carcinogens in the form of reactive oxygen species.

(1)'<\/p>\n\n<p>The molecular mechanism most often thought of for cancer formation is genotoxic oncogenesis, damage to DNA. Here, genotoxic oncogenesis often involves a reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may generate free radicals which, when reacting with other molecules, generate more free radicals. Another example of a reaction involving free radicals is a fire. Human cells contain genes for antioxidant enzymes, like glutathione and superoxide dismutase, which catalytically converts the free radical superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. <\/p>\n\n<p>The abundance of ROS in our cells has 2 components:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Production of ROS<\/li>\n<li>Depletion of ROS by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Intracellular levels of ROS positively regulate levels of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione and superoxide dismutase <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12441363\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2).<\/a> This means that more oxidative stress leades to more protection from ROS by antioxidant enzymes.

It is a good concise guide, and reduces to some extent the mathematics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Theorem 1.3 is used to show the decay of heterozygosity in a population due to genetic drift.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Consider alleles in a population.  Two alleles drawn at random can differ by state, meaning they have two different DNA sequences. In other words, they are different alleles. Or the randomly drawn can have the same state, meaning they are the same allele. For alleles that are identical by state, they could differ by origin, meaning they are the same allele from two different chromosomes. The two alleles in a homozygous individual differ by <em>origin<\/em> (sampled from maternal and paternal homologs) but are identical by <em>state<\/em>.  Or, two identical alleles could differ by descent, meaning they are the same because they trace ultimately back to a common ancestor.<\/p>\n\n<p>To calculate heterozygosity, you can first account for homozygosity, the frequencies of alleles that are identical by state. First consider two alleles identical by origin.  If you draw two alleles identical by origin when t=1, the probability that the two alleles are copies of same original allele (from the same chromosome) is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{1}{2N}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>because there was only a single copy of that allele on that one chromosome in the population prior to the round of mating, so it is 1 out of the 2N alleles at time point 0 ($t=0$).  The probability that two alleles identical by state are <em>not<\/em> identical by origin then is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$1-\\frac{1}{2N}.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, total homozygosity ($G'$) in the population (identical by state) after one round of random mating is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$G' = \\frac{1}{2N} + (1-\\frac{1}{2N})G,$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $G$ is the homozygosity prior to the round of mating.  Of course, anything not homozygous is heterozygous. So, heterozyosity ($H$) is simply,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H=1-G.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>By substituting the formula for $G$ into the above equation, the equation for $H$ becomes,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H' = 1-G' = (1-\\frac{1}{2N})H$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $H$ is the heterozygosity prior to the round of mating.  This formula represents the change in heterozygosity after one round of random mating.  This can now be expanded for several rounds of random mating. For example, the change from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H_1 = (1-\\frac{1}{2N})H_0.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The change from $t=1$ to $t=2$ is,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H_2 = (1-\\frac{1}{2N})H_1$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the change in heterozygosity from $t=0$ to $t=2$ is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H_2 = (1-\\frac{1}{2N})^2H_0.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be expanded to any time $t$ with the equation,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H_t = (1-\\frac{1}{2N})^tH_0,$$<\/p>\n\n<p>which you will recognize as Durrett's Theorem 1.3.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, in the Wright-Fisher model, two alleles that have a common ancestor are by definition identical by state and so cannot contribute to heterozygosity.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.

The effects are most prominent under 30m and commercial/technical dives doing dives to 40/50m on air tend to experience the effects most. (Narcosis is managed by adding an inert gas - in most gases Helium - to air to form a mixture referred to as Trimix (Helium/Oxygen/Nitrogen) this then produces an effect as if the diver is diving to a shallower depth and is referred to as Equivalent Narcotic Depth, in some cases Heliox (Helium &amp; Oxygen) was also used)<\/p>\n\n<p>High Pressure Nervous Syndrome is an interesting aspect of deep diving and used to be called Helium Jitters/Tremors as the accepted standard was that it was caused by breathing Helium mixtures under 150m. Some people hold this to be true and others claim that it has nothing to do with Helium but rather the pressure disrupting the flow of electric signals thru the nervous system.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is interesting is that they found that if you used Trimix (Helium/Nitrogen/Oxygen) rather than Heliox (Helium/Oxygen) the onset happened later or not as severe.

Their strength is in numbers. At room temperature, fully one fifth of the water molecules are engaged in four bonds with other water molecules, while the remainder forms two such bonds. (More detail at <a href=\"http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html<\/a> ). In contrast, hydrogen sulfide forms essentially no hydrogen bonds with other hydrogen sulfide molecules, despite significant similarity between oxygen and sulfide. The difference in size between oxygen and sulfur makes the former much more electronegative. I could go on with other hydrogen compounds, but the fact that answers your first question is: each water molecule is involved in a series of bonds with other water molecules, on an unequaled scale.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Also, hydrogen bonds are stronger, pickier about distance and angle than the alternatives available to other molecules (dipole-dipole, van der Waals etc.) So even if they seem feeble, and even if the alternatives were as plentiful as hydrogen bonds, the latter would still be more capable of tying up molecules.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The effect of water drying (which comes after swimming, but also after sweating, bathing, or cleaning oneself with a hot oshibori) is caused by water evaporation. Each state transition, including that from liquid water to air-borne vapors, is a heat-consuming phenomenon. When skin dries, the heat to turn water into vapors has to come from somewhere. In perspiration's case, it is one's body.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Note that cooling down while water evaporates is not only something we feel, but a physical reality, occurring even in innate systems.

Were water non-polar, it would have lower latent heat, or, in lay terms, it would evaporate without much heat consumption.

While the other answers here propose various adaptive reasons, they do not actually explain the presence of the long snout in the majority of mammals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, you have to look at the evolutionary history of mammals and vertebrates. Modern mammals have long snouts because they inherited the trait from their earliest mammalian ancestors, such as <em>Morganocodon<\/em>. In turn <em>Morganucodon<\/em> and other early mammals had long snouts inherited from their synapsid (\"reptilian\") ancestors like the sphenacodontid (see the first phylogenetic tree below). Why did the synapsids have long snouts, then?  Because the earliest tetrapods like <em>Ichthyostega<\/em> had snouts. Before that, the lobe-finned fishes like <em>Eustenopteron<\/em> and <em>Panderichthys<\/em> had the elongated snouts (see the second phylogenetic tree below).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AYOoq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3MykK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the mammalian snouts were modified through natural selection to take on various shapes and sizes (or become greatly reduced) for various (presumably) adaptive reasons, as suggested by the other answers. <\/p>\n\n<p>An analogous question is why do all mammals have four appendages (arms and legs)? They inherited the four appendages from their common tetrapod ancestor, which in turn inherited the appendages from their ancestral lobe-finned fishes. The appendages are later modified by natural selection. That same reasoning applies to this question about mammalian snouts.<\/p>\n\n<p>When using phylogenetic trees to study the adaptive changes of particular traits (such as snouts), a researcher can first use comparative techniques like phylogenetically independent contrasts to tease out the effects of inheritance due to common ancestry.

There is a longer story, with cells pumping other ions in or out, or leaking ions due to the imbalance, but <strong>resting membrane potential<\/strong> really revolves around sodium. There is an imbalance in sodium across the membrane, and that makes sodium naturally try to balance out, by trying to leak back in.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am sure you have heard about the famous sodium/potassium ATPase. It expels sodium ions, while letting in fewer positive ions. It is just the most studied way the cells are going about making sure their innards poorer in cations, that is, negatively charged when compared to their environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>All these pumps are ATP-dependent, and you would know ATP is the main energy store. So as long as cells live and make ATP, they can maintain this difference between their innards and the environment. Once they die, ATP is gone, pumps stop, and there is no sodium disequilibrium - no membrane potential.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Diffusion potential<\/strong> is an artificial concept that we use in order to make sense of the membrane. We imagine a membrane that opposes sodium movement alone, and we calculate how hard will it be (how much energy must be spent) to keep the asymmetry of low sodium inside - higher sodium outside, were a hole punched in the semipermeable membrane. Luckily, we can use some physics and maths, and figure that this energy is dependent of the ratio of sodium concentrations ([Na]in divided by [Na]out). For typical cells, there are 150 mM Na outside and 15 mM Na inside a cell; physics tells us it will take 62 milli-electronvolts to hold a Na ion out once some hole is found.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you don't provide those 62 meV and you don't close the doors for leaking, sodium ions will fly in. And that is indeed what happens in depolarization, when sodium gets a chance to move.<\/p>\n\n<p>These electronvolts are a unit of energy, or work. We can think of a few way of performing this work on a Na ion that tries to leak in: heat the cell until ions stop caring about direction of movement, hold the outside Na in some tight  chemical structure etc. But the simplest way is to apply an electric field. If you add to the concentration imbalance a 62 mV electrical difference in electrical potential, you stopped the flow of sodium either way. Get a bit less than 62 mV, and the Na ions will carry on their old ways and try to no avail to leak into the cell. Get a bit above 62 mV, and the flow of sodium will be force in the opposite way. Stay on 62 mV and you achieve <strong>equilibrium potential<\/strong>: neither direction will have the upper hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>The picture is more complex once you factor in the other ions, but the facts are: resting an action potentials are voltages one can measure across membranes, diffusion potentials are part of an abstract model, while equilibrium potential is something one could impose on a cell - not natural, yet not plain fiction.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20827,"question_id":20826,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1409116626},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100006604836854/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":8570,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8570/mattkaeo","reputation":884,"display_name":"mattkaeo"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1409209799,"creation_date":1409209071,"body":"<p>To understand what a membrane potential is, you should understand the units for -80mv.

In it there is the flow of liquid along a concentration gradient. Water then flows from the side which contains the low concentration of dissolved molecules (this can be salts or sugar for example) to the side with the higher concentration until it reached equilibrium. This principle is shown in the image below (all images from the Wikipeadia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis\">osmosis<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/S9abq.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The blue dots are the dissolved material, the concentration is high on the right side and lower on the left. Through the dotted line in the middle (which is a semi-permeable membrane) only the solvent can pass to reach a concentration equilibrium. There is a pretty cool osmotic pressure simulator available on <a href=\"http://molo.concord.org/database/activities/72.html\">Molecular Logic<\/a> which can also help understanding the principle.<\/p>\n\n<p>And this is exactly what happens to the yeast cells. The sugar crystalls get dissolved (at least partly) by some of the humidity from the yeast block (this will not work with dried yeast) and form a highly concentrated sugar solution (also called hypertonic). The sugar concentration inside the cells is relatively low (called hypotonic). This leads to the effort to balance the concentration inside the cell and outside of it which then leads to a massive efflux of water from the cells. This goes so far, that the cell membranes break and the interior of the cells is released (nucleus, DNA, proteins and so on) and the sugar is completely dissolved in the released water. The reason why this mixture is so \"gooey\" afterwards is the DNA, which forms long, thick strains.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gv3Y7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This method can be used in the lab to break up cells relatively gently without applying too much force.<\/p>\n\n<p>When baking you should make sure, that your yeast is not coming directly into contact with undissolved sugar (or salt which works the same way), as this will kill a part of your yeast cells.

Development of a complete nipple begins in the eutherian (placental) mammals. <\/p>\n\n<p>The mammary glands develop early in the embryo along a pair of ridges called the mammary ridge, mammary lines, or milk line (shown in an adult human in the figure below, taken from Wikipedia). The nipples form along this line. In humans, this happens during the <a href=\"https://www.glowm.com/resources/glowm/cd/pages/v5/v5c030.html\">fifth week<\/a> of development. Within a few days, nipples begin to form. The number of nipples pairs that form is characteristic of the species (e.g., 1 pair in humans to 9 pairs in pigs).
