However, a <a href=\"http://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/default-source/synthetic-biology/2015-01-05-crispr-methods-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">poster<\/a> suggests that a properly designed DNA fragment can be delivered and produce sufficient amounts of guide RNA in situ to produce efficient cutting.<\/p>\n\n<p>The integration step is where the template DNA is inserted into the double strand break by homologous repair. Homologous repair efficiencies vary greatly from cell to cell, and is often less efficient than non-homologous end joining. However, using a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=nat.+methods+8+2011+753+-+755\" rel=\"nofollow\">single-stranded DNA<\/a> might increase the efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, even if only a small percentage of cells is correctly edited, it may be possible to select those cells and grow them. <a href=\"https://www.neb.com/~/media/NebUs/Files/Brochures/Expressions_IssueI_2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">NEB<\/a> describes a Cas9-GFP fusion (page 4) that can be used to bind GFP to a certain DNA sequence. It may be possible to produce CFP and YFP variants of this construct and use FRET to detect cells with the knock in. (This is where the speculation comes in) With the two fusion proteins and two guide RNAs for adjacent sequences in the knock-in gene, you might be able to detect cells where a CFP and YFP cas9 are close enough that you get FRET. This might allow you to sort cells by FACS, and then grow those cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course if your knock-in is making a membrane bound protein exposed to the surface, you could just use labeled antibodies to detect that protein.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30919,"question_id":30839,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTYSx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14826,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14826/cagliari2005","reputation":2361,"display_name":"cagliari2005"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":1,"post_id":30983,"edited":false,"creation_date":1427954943,"comment_id":51635,"body":"Interesting answer."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":1,"post_id":30983,"edited":false,"creation_date":1427984686,"comment_id":51663,"body":"Looks like they also used single stranded DNA oligos for some of their short insertions <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nbt.3190-S1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(see supplementary table 7)<\/a>, consistent with my speculation based answer below.

I compare because it's fairly clear to most individuals that we are all the same species: homo sapiens. About breeding, it is very likely that a reproductive specialist would be quite concerned (I certainly would be) about a woman with drarfism carrying the child of a very tall person (who had very tall parents), but not the opposite pairing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Below is a photograph of the wedding of Tom Thumb and Lavinia Warren. That union produced no children. Her bridesmaid Minnie, (her sister), who was only 27 inches tall, also married a little person (Edward Newell). She became pregnant with a normal-sized child, but died during the birthing of a 6 pound baby (her baby died as well).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CItC1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Are they a different species? No. A paleontologist (a good one) would be able to tell that the bones of a little person was actually of the same species based on certain conformations, just as I believe paleontologists today could distinguish prehistoric small cats from very large cats. Size matters, but not nearly as much as the type and distribution of teeth, the shape of the jaw, etc.  In other words, I strongly disagree with the following:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If somehow the recognized [dog] breeds existed only as fossils, paleontol­ogists would consider them not one species but many\u2014certainly more than the thirty-six species of wild dogs that live in nature today.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That statement is based on a fairly profound error in thinking: a cognitive bias that is mistrustful of science in general due to a lack of familiarity with the rigors involved in the scientific methods of paleontologists in particular. I say this without rancor or animus of any kind; where I settled down (in the deeply religious region), the vast majority of my children's friends' parents are creationists, and the vast majority of our friends are fundamentalists. We argue about science all the time; I know the basic arguments. I'm familiar with their websites. I personally find myself in the camp of Christian thinkers like geneticist Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., the director of the Human Genome Project, who understand genetics and find no threat to their faith in evolution or science.

The same articles mentions fruit fly research that bred two different species of fruit fly and made fertile offspring, even though they would never interbreed in the wild. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is speculation, but let's imagine taking an island and putting several breeds of dogs on that island. Many of those breeds would easily interbreed and create mutts. But I'm pretty sure there would some sorting, the large dogs like st. bernards and great danes aren't going to easily interbreed with tiny dogs like chihuahuas. If we came back to this island after 50 or 100 years, we'd probably see small dogs and large dogs (assuming the island had decent ecological niches for both sizes of dogs to survive in)<\/p>\n\n<p>Creationists like to ask why we haven't observed the evolution of a new species and don't want to listen to arguments about the fossil record or DNA sequences. If we just define some dog breeds as different species, we'd have an easy answer. I think some dogs would at least come close to meeting that definition for these reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dog breeds with large size differences would have great difficulty breeding.<\/li>\n<li>Some pairs of breeds seem to have trouble interbreeding (Beagles + Irish Setter). <\/li>\n<li>Some animals recognized as different species can create fertile hybrid offspring.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>So why don't we recognize some dog breeds as different species?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":27602,"tags":["evolution","species"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1461,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S6fkuyKRdbI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/mZjdnVkxvmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":18980,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18980/lao","reputation":1,"display_name":"Lao"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":38999,"edited":false,"creation_date":1443021206,"comment_id":65095,"body":"&quot;<i>.. to figure things out.<\/i>&quot;...

The main risk, though, is bleeding. Puncturing an artery can cause it to bleed until it tamponades, causing a hematoma which can  cause ischemia downstream and might compress/damage the nerve in that neurovascular bundle.

From a purely practical standpoint, veins are easier to access due to their superficial location compared to the arteries which are located deeper under the skin. They have thinner walls (much less smooth muscle surrounding them) than arteries, and have less innervation, so piercing them with a needle requires less force and doesn't hurt as much. Venous pressure is also lower than arterial pressure, so there is less of a chance of blood seeping back out through the puncture point before it heals. Because of their thinner walls, veins tend to be larger than the corresponding artery in the area, so they hold more blood, making collection easier and faster. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, it is somewhat safer if a small embolism (bubble in the blood) is introduced into a vein rather than an artery. Blood flow in veins always goes to larger and larger vessels, so there is very little chance of a vessel being blocked by the embolism before the bubble reaches the heart/lungs and is hopefully destroyed. Blood flow in an artery, on the other hand, always moves into smaller and smaller vessels, eventually ending in capilllaries, and there is a chance that a bubble introduced by a blood draw (generally rare) or more commonly an intravenous line (IV) could block a small blood vessel, potentially leading to hypoxia in the affected tissues.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27800,"question_id":27799,"up_vote_count":40,"last_edit_date":1422111607},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05769301bfbe1e559b059d218ab24c59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":13066,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13066/ashok-padmanabhan","reputation":241,"display_name":"Ashok Padmanabhan"},"score":14,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1421549718,"creation_date":1421549718,"body":"<p>Right of the bat, veins are superficial so it is much easier to hit a vein than an artery.

I know this addressing an erroneous assumption in the question rather than the question itself but bear with me. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ok, so as has already been mentioned, different cell types in a multicellular eukaryote (like a mouse, or a human) only grow in certain environments and this is really important . Think about it like this, a mouse's body is made up of many different cell types all working together to create functional organs and systems and to ultimately make up the mouse. The individual cells don't know they are all coming together to make an entire animal and a cell is designed to grow and proliferate in order to make more copies of itself and spread. So why don't all cells just grow all over the place, on top of each other and spread to all parts of the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason you and the mouse aren't a formless mass of undifferentiated cells - like a big soft tumour - is because different cell types develop in such a manner that they can only grow in a restricted, structured way in a certain environment in your body. There are mechanical and chemical signals along with unique sets of growth factors that are found in different environments in the body that make it possible for certain cell types to grow in one area while not in another. It's why only blood cells can survive suspended in the blood not adhered to anything and your fibroblast cells (they make up your structured connective tissue can't, they need to adhere to a surface to grow. The different cell types only get their signal to keep growing when they are in their proper environment.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is why when scientists are growing various mammalian cell cultures they have to be aware of what environment and growth factors the specific cell type they are working with requires in order to grow. <strong>Some mammalian (e.g. mouse) cells<\/strong> need a structured scaffold to grow them in culture and some <strong>can grow in soft or liquid culture.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Source: Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00127-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411001279%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00127-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411001279%3Fshowall%3Dtrue<\/a> [This is a classic paper that explains this far better than I can hope to - look for the section 'Sustaining Proliferative Signaling'.]<\/p>\n","answer_id":38990,"question_id":38857,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38857/why-do-cells-not-spread-on-soft-substrates","last_activity_date":1442951563,"creation_date":1442509822,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do cells not spread on soft substrates?","body":"<p>I recently read a paper discussing how cells (primary mouse embryo fibroblasts) fail to spread and proliferate properly when plated on a soft substrate (i.e. soft PDMS pillars with stiffness k = 2.3 nN$\\mu$m$^{-1}$), but spreading and proliferation can be restored with cyclic stretching of cells. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150223/ncomms7333/full/ncomms7333.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150223/ncomms7333/full/ncomms7333.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>My question is if we understand why cells need to be on a hard surface to do normal operations (proliferate and spread)?

In humans, for example, two cytochrome P450 enzymes\u2014 namely,CYP2D6 and <strong>CYP3A4<\/strong> \u2014 metabolise over half the orally administered drugs currently used. (Gonzalez and Tukey,2006).<\/p>\n\n<p>The various different CYP enzymes can act on various different foreign organic compounds with varying levels of efficiency. The CYP enzymes oxidise these organic molecules adding on -OH groups to make them more solube and thus more easily excreted. <\/p>\n\n<p>Grapefruit contains compounds known as furanocoumarins that block the CYP3A4 enzymes. These compounds do this by irreversibly binding to the CYP3A4 enzymes, putting them out of commission. Like the wikipedia article says it takes about 24 hours for the CYP3A4 enzymes to return to normal levels after the average glass of grapefruit juice is consumed. During this time your body\u2019s ability to process drugs for elimination is decreased because CYP3A4 is the main CYP enzyme for processing many drugs and toxins. <\/p>\n\n<p>You might think that this could be used to reduce the dose for a drug, but the amount of furanocoumarin in your blood would vary widely (grapefruit isn't uniform in it's concentrations) and CYP3A4 levels vary between individuals. \n If you tried using grapefruit juice or another source of furanocoumarins to do this you'd be reduced to guessing how much of your prescribed drug is safe to take. Blood levels of the drug may rise, resulting in the risk for new or worsened side effects. it can essentially cause the normal, dose of a therapeutic drug to act like an overdose by increasing the bioavailabilty of the drug in your body. Better not to risk it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:\n 1.

For this reason, when one is taking certain medications it is necessary to not eat grapefruits because the inhibition of CYP3A4 can reduce how much of the drug is metabolized before it can get used, resulting in an overdose.   It apparently takes 24 hours after eating a grapefruit before the enzyme level is 50% and up to 72 hours for it to be completely normal.  So, it seems that eating one grapefruit a day would substantially impair one's CYP3A4 levels indefinitely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia says, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4\">the purpose of CYP3A4<\/a> is \"to oxidize small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics), such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed from the body.\"   It seems like inhibiting CYP3A4, from a biological standpoint, would reduce one's immune system or at least the ability to tolerate and eliminate certain toxins.   Are there other enzymes that take up the slack, or is there something in grapefruit itself which does the job instead, or is a daily grapefruit just a bad idea?  What are the effects of extended inhibition of CYP3A4?

The higher the magnitude of acceleration, the more action potentials will be sent.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is also where dizziness comes from, as the endolymph and otoliths do not come to rest at the same rate, momentarily giving the brain two different interpretations of what acceleration you're experiencing.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is also the Doppler Effect:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DTvnc.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DTvnc.gif\" alt=\"Doppler Effect -- Wikipedia\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Based in the cochlear system of the inner ear this time, instead of the vestibular system, the doppler effect is interpreted by the brain and gives a very rough interpretation of both velocity <em>and<\/em> acceleration (if the velocity of the object happens to be changing).<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is the entire visual side of things. Motion blur and the speed at which the perception of objects change size are large contributors to our sense of visual acceleration, but almost all of this is done via complex manipulation of visual data in the occipital and frontal lobes.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also countless minor contributors: skin and join tension (the sensation of weight due to acceleration), ease of breathing, sensory cells in your hair if your hair is exposed to the open air while acceleration, blood pressure sensors (and numbness when the body can't compensate), etc.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In any of these cases, why I was feeling more acceleration while siting opposite than in direction of acceleration?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess would be because your body is more visually attuned to facing the same direction as the acceleration, and when you were facing the opposing direction your mind overcompensated in an effort to protect you since you probably don't get a lot of opportunities to rapidly accelerate backwards over distances of more than a few feet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your brain might also have been panicking a bit because you couldn't see where you were going (usually very bad), and the heightened sensory state made the magnitude of the acceleration feel greater.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are my best guesses, however.

As an example, this <a href=\"https://www.ohio.edu/research/compliance/upload/Anesthesia-Depth-Rodents.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">handout on monitoring anaesthetic depth in rodents<\/a> has the following entry on the list of criteria for surgical anesthesia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Withdrawal    reflexes    are absent! Try at  least   2   toes    and the ears    so  that    you are  sure   that    this    reflex  is  absent.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>Knee-jerk reflex: early history<\/h3>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it is known from the XIX century that stretch reflexes such as knee-jerk (note that they are monosynaptic) are very persistent. They can be abolished under some drugs (such as e.g. chloroform and ether) that act directly on the spine, but keep working under others. I am quoting from three old papers on the topic (here and below emphasis is mine).<\/p>\n\n<p>Horsley, 1883, <a href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/3/369\" rel=\"nofollow\">Note on the patellar knee-jerk<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1881, while experimenting (on myself) with this gas [nitrous oxide] for\n  a different purpose, it occurred to me to contrast the conditions of the superficial and deep \"reflexes,\" taking the\n  plantar reflex as an example of the former, and the patellar\n  phenomenon to illustrate the latter. Being aware of the fact\n  that <strong>deep chloroform-narcosis abolishes all the \"reflexes,\"<\/strong>\n  superficial and deep, and yet that with ether-narcosis, however deep, ankle-clonus frequently, appears, I was scarcely\n  surprised to find that <strong>the knee-jerk persisted in the deepest\n  anaesthesia from nitrous oxide,<\/strong> while the superficial reflexes\n  all disappeared.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sherrington, 1892, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1514413/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Notes on the arrangement of some motor fibres in the lumbo-sacral plexus<\/a> (p 671):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regard to the effect of anaesthetics on the \"jerk,\" a better proof of\n  the action of chloroform being rapid and direct on the nervous mechanisms of\n  the cord itself could hardly be found than in the <strong>speedy abolition of the\n  \"jerk\" by chloroform inhalation<\/strong> when the cord has been previously divided\n  in the thoracic region.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Simpson &amp; Herring, 1905, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1465681/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The effect of cold narcosis on reflex action in warm-blooded animals<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The knee-jerk is a very persistent phenomenon.<\/strong> It is known to disappear in deep anesthesia produced by ether or chloroform [Sherrington 1892]. [...] The knee-jerk is as a rule easily elicited, and we find it present when\n  all the reflexes have disappeared. [...] The lower the\n  temperature the smaller the jerk. [...] In several animals that died at a low temperature the disappearance of the knee-jerk was simultaneous with death [...] The lowest temperature at which we found the knee-jerk present was 15° C., and this\n  was also the lowest temperature at which any of our animals were\n  still alive. [...] Pinching the skin does not provoke any response till the temperature is 25° C.

Matute et al., 2004, <a href=\"http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/3/422.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the excitability of rat spinal motoneurones and nociceptive reflexes in vitro<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We used an isolated spinal cord in vitro preparation from rat pups and superfused the anaesthetics at known concentrations. [...] Applied at anaesthetic concentrations, [...] <strong>sevoflurane produced a large depressant effect on the monosynaptic reflex whereas propofol was ineffective.<\/strong> [...] Sevoflurane produces large inhibitory effects on nociceptive and non-nociceptive reflexes which are likely to contribute to immobility during surgery. Compared with sevoflurane, propofol appears to have much weaker effects on spinal reflexes such as those recorded in an isolated preparation. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Kerz et al., 2001, <a href=\"http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/Article.aspx?articleid=1945168\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of Propofol on H-reflex in Humans<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Previous studies of motoneuron excitability using H-reflexes or F-waves during general anesthesia found significant depression after administration of halothane,  enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, or nitrous oxide. [...]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Recommended propofol doses for induction and maintenance only had a transient effect on the H-reflex and were no longer demonstrable after 10 min of propofol anesthesia. [...] Immobility during propofol anesthesia [...] does not seem to be caused by a depression of spinal motoneuron circuit excitability.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So why is then the withdrawal reflex so easily abolished and the stretch reflex is so persistent (e.g. under propofol)? This does not seem to be well understood. Baars et al., 2009, <a href=\"http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/Article.aspx?articleid=1923785\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of Sevoflurane and Propofol on the Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex and on the H Reflex<\/a> write<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both H reflex and nociceptive withdrawal reflexes are reduced dose-dependently by propofol and sevoflurane in humans.

It's generally used in simple pattern recognition situations where each case has no bearing on the next. The learning portion is performed ahead of time during the training phase. For example, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">deterministic<\/a> perceptron isn't permitted to change after training. In contrast, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biological Neuron Model<\/a> is much more complex, and uses a variety of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation\" rel=\"nofollow\">ordinary differential equations<\/a> to integrate the <em>cumulative<\/em> behavior of neurons <em>over time<\/em>. As such, those models are non-deterministic and don't see as much practical use outside of experimentation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To address your second question<\/strong>, neurons themselves don't \"learn.\" A single neuron is essentially meaningless. Learning is an emergent process created by the interaction of several systems at once. While one influencing factor is connectivity (zero for no connection, non-zero for the inhibitory or excitatory connection which emulates both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity\" rel=\"nofollow\">synaptic<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsynaptic_plasticity\" rel=\"nofollow\">non-synaptic<\/a>), what you might call short term learning can also be performed by existing clusters of neurons, without any change in connectivity. Biologically, this is what must occur <em>before<\/em> any of the comparably slow process of tissue remodelling can take place, and the computationally equivalent process is only possible in time-aware models like the aforementioned Biological Neuron Model.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, someone who wishes to learn to play guitar. When they begin playing, existing clusters emulate the desired behavior as best as they can. These neurons act as the functional scaffold that initiates and drives the neuroplastic process. Playing becomes <em>easier<\/em> because this scaffold becomes more efficient as new connections (shortcuts) are created, existing connections are strengthened, and irrelevant connections are inhibited. The improved scaffold in turn allows further improvements. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newborn neurons<\/a> may also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblast\" rel=\"nofollow\">migrate<\/a> to the area, though the how, why, and when of that process is unclear to me. This \"behavior emulation\" or \"short term learning\" process used in practicing the guitar, or whenever a novel situation is encountered, must be primarily governed by excitatory and inhibitory neurons' influence.

The host genome would have acquired these genes by a lateral gene transfer mechanism. Now, because the endosymbionts that have lost these genes randomly, would have a lower cost of maintenance (as they can acquire these gene products from the host cell) compared to those who still maintain these genes themselves, the former will outgrow the latter at some point. Note that there is a constraint on the population size and therefore there is a good chance that the endosymbionts with full set of genes, could go extinct because of their additional growth cost. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a probable way by which the endosymbionts lost their genes and became dependent on the host. It has been observed the number of genes transferred to the host correlates with the number of endosymbionts present in the cell. The rationale behind the limited transfer window hypothesis is that if the number of endosymbionts is high, then the likelihood for the host to tolerate damage to a few endosymbionts is higher (note that damage was the first step in the endosymbiont to host gene transfer). <\/p>\n\n<p>This is still a hypothesis and the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Timmis, Jeremy N., et al. \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg1271\" rel=\"nofollow\">Endosymbiotic gene transfer: organelle\ngenomes forge eukaryotic chromosomes<\/a>.\" Nature Reviews Genetics\n5.2 (2004): 123-135.<\/li>\n<li>Smith, David Roy, Kate Crosby, and Robert W.

During one's adolescence, one typically has a large number of salient memories, due to the distinctness of events. People often make new friends, move frequently, attend different schools, and have several jobs. As each of these memories is unique, recollection of these (many) memories gives the impression that the time span was large.<\/p>\n\n<p>In contrast, older adults have fewer unique experiences. They tend to work a single job, and live in a single place, and have set routines which they may follow for years. For this reason, memories are less distinct, and are often blurred together or consolidated. Upon recollection, it seems like time went by quickly because we can't remember what actually happened.<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, it can be considered a special case of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability heuristic<\/a>: people judge a time span to be longer in which there are more salient/unique events.<\/p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, (and to at least <em>mention<\/em> biology), episodic memory has been shown to be neurally distinct from semantic memory in the brain. In particular, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dissociation\">double dissociation<\/a> has been shown for amnesics who suffer from semantic or episodic memory, but not both.<\/p>\n\n<p>My apologies for the lack of citations, but a good bit about autobiographical memories can be found in:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1841695408\">Eysenck, M.W., &amp; Keane, M.T.

The short answer (as far as I can say this after my literature search) is that we don't know the answer for sure. The long version follows below.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main problem with all these hypothesis is that they have some valid point, but a definitive hasn't been given yet. All these hypotheses are listed in the first reference, with a ton of additional references in the paper. I will summarize the different hypotheses only shortly here, for details please read the paper. The second reference is also interesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>The point when this process started is after we the last common ancestor of chimpanzee and humans divided into both lines. Chimpanzees are our closest relatives and still have hairs, so this process must have started afterwards. Analyzes of MC1R mutations (which affect pigmentation) suggest that human are hairless for at least 1.2 million years. See reference 3 for details here.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Aquatic ape hypothesis (also known as aquatic ape theory):<\/strong> This hypothesis states that the modern humans spent some time semi-aquatic. In this lifestyle fur is not insulating very good and this led to an evolutionary disadvantage. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cooling hypothesis:<\/strong> This hypothesis states that the modern humans lost their hairs when then left the forests and started to live in the savannah. There they got too warm with their fur and finally lost it. This hypothesis sounds logic on the first thought, but contains a few problems. Naked humans have two problems, at the day they collect quite some heat over their skin which requires them to have a cooling system (we sweat to cool us), in cold nights we need a lot of internal energy to keep our temperature stable. Insulation however works both ways (not only keeps warm in, but also can keep heat out), and indeed some savannah monkey have a denser fur than their relatives in the forest. The cooling system will also lead to water loss and potential dehydration.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hunting hypothesis:<\/strong> This hypothesis states that humans started to be carnivores and therefore had the need to run extended periods of time to hunt for meat. This leads to thermal overload, without a fur they can release this heat much faster without overheating.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bipedality hypothesis:<\/strong> This hypothesis assumes that modern humans, walking on two feed have a lower direct influx of solar radiation. This lowers the chance for overheating.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Allometry hypothesis:<\/strong> Allometry states that species which get bigger during evolution, do not have all their organs getting bigger at the same rate. The hypothesis states that humans got bigger, the number of hairs stayed the same and finally got lost.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Clothing hypothesis:<\/strong> One of the more unlogic hypothesis, which assumes that hair loss wasn't critical for humans, as they managed to make themselves clothes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vestiary hypothesis:<\/strong> A mix of the cooling and the clothing hypothesis: Here it is assumed that hair loss is beneficial due to more cooling and that the negative effects of too much loss of heat is saved by the invention of artificial insulation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Neoteny hypothesis:<\/strong> Neoteny denotes the retention of of juvenile physical characteristics in adults. Humans are characterized as retarded in development (compared to the apes) and matures slower. Additional it is assumed that some characteristics (here loss of hair) of juvenile or foetal apes are maintained.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Carrion-eating hypothesis:<\/strong> Another strange hypothesis, which assumes, that man as messy eater (like condors, which also have naked necks) have an advantage of being hairless.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sex-related hypothesis:<\/strong> This hypothesis assumes that hairless skin is more sensitive to stimuli like touch, temperature and pain. This would allow a more sensitive social contacts, especially between man and woman, but also between woman and child. Pubic hair is not explained by this hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Adaptation-against-ectoparasites hypothesis:<\/strong> Here it is assumed, that naked humans are less prone to harbour ticks, fleas and other parasites which hide and live within fur. Apes have great social rituals of removing these within their group.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://users.utu.fi/mjranta/reprints/Rantala%202007.pdf\">Evolution of nakedness in Homo sapiens<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://omicsonline.org/the-hairless-mutation-hypothesis-explains-not-only-the-origin-of%20humanization-from-the-human-ape-common-ancestor-but-also-immature-baby-delivery-2161-0436.1000111.pdf\">The Hairless Mutation Hypothesis Explains Not Only the Origin of\nHumanization from the Human/Ape Common Ancestor but also Immature\nBaby Delivery<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/uspace/id/682\">Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human\nbody hair.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":23707,"question_id":23693,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1415170126},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KK1zs.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":18939,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18939/keith-walters","reputation":21,"display_name":"Keith Walters"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":38952,"edited":false,"creation_date":1442796922,"comment_id":64953,"body":"Welcome to Biology.

The AAUAAA is needed for cleavage and polyadenylation because deletion or mutation of the AAUAAA hexamer prevents generation of the polyadenylated 3' end (though in plants and fungi there can be considerable variation from the AAUAAA motif).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I should add that the significance of 11 to 30, or as you said 10 to 35 nucleotides is that it is telling you the approximate size of the protein complex that is sitting on the RNA and where the active site of the protein is. The domain that recognizes the termination sequence is about 10 to 35 bases wide. It is likely that the variation is due to the RNA sequence following the termination sequence ability to form a stem loop structure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Campbell takes a necessarily basic and less nuanced approach to the information that they provide on molecular biology. The approach is to provide some details and show the evolutionary commonalities between a diverse range of biological systems. The approach is okay as it gets you into the frame of mind of thinking about the interconnectedness of biological systems. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you progress in your studies you will see that the reality and specifics are far more complex and exception based than was presented in introductory courses. But the more advanced courses spend an entire semester focused on what Campbell's covers in one chapter.

Most people aren't just concocting virus.  Generally, for viruses that humans can get, it's generally recommended/heavily encouraged to only use what you need for safety reasons.  So, for example, you might transfect the one protein you think is important to see what it does by itself.  After that, you might transfect the cell culture with the full virus, but with one important gene knocked-out.  I used to make single-round HIV by using a plasmid for full-length HIV without a functioning envelope gene and another plasmid for VSV envelope; new HIV particles would be made infectious because of the VSV gene but after infecting they no longer had that gene anymore.  Basically, a limited version of the virus, which leads me to...<\/li>\n<li>You want to make virus-like particles.  These are one of the better-named things in science and are just what they sound like \u2014 particles that look a lot like virus, but aren't.  Generally, they're empty shells.

There are around two freshwater nemerteans in Africa, neither of which looks like your worm, and in any case most nemerteans move by gliding using their cilia.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the remaining group is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annelid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Annelida<\/a>. There are three groups of annelids relevant in this context: polychetes, oligochetes and leeches. Polychetes are predominantly marine and normally have more or less pronounced parapodia (\"limbs\"). Some of the do behave according to your description, but they are very <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=arenicola&amp;tbm=isch\" rel=\"nofollow\">characteristic<\/a> in their appearance and you would not expect to find them in a bathtub.<\/p>\n\n<p>What remains are oligochetes and leeches. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=leech&amp;tbm=isch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leeches<\/a> are more or less dorso-ventrally flattened and have very prominent suckers. Moreover a fed leech (from which you would expect large quantities of blood) would look swelled (the gut in leeches has diverticula).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, the only worm group I can reasonably suggest is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligochaeta\" rel=\"nofollow\">oligochetes<\/a>. In fact your worm looks and behaves very much like a common <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?isch&amp;q=earthworm\" rel=\"nofollow\">earthworm<\/a>. It is very typical of them to be highly mobile during and after rains and their blood pigment is <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ad4rDwD_GhsC&amp;pg=PA18\" rel=\"nofollow\">hemoglobin<\/a> (i.e. red).

From its course, it appeared to have come up the bath plug from the drains. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IZRGY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IZRGY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>It's about 2mm-3mm wide at the fattest points and 1mm wide at the thinnest points (which vary as it moves). It's maybe around 10cm in length. The picture's not the clearest but (to the naked eye) it looked almost completely featureless - smooth (no visible rings), and no obvious hooks or features at either end. <\/p>\n\n<p>It was moving to the right from the point of view of the photo, and moved by narrowing and elongating unmarked segments about 2-4cm long each rather than the whole body. I say segments, since it seemed to be the same sections each time, but when it wasn't moving there was nothing to distinguish these segments. Its movements began by elongating the very front 2-3cm, then it'd feel around, come down, and other (unmarked) segments in the body would expand and contract to bring the rest of the body after it.<\/p>\n\n<p>While I'm pretty sure it's not either of the two most notoriously nasty West African parasitic worms (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loa_loa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loa Loa<\/a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculus_medinensis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guinea Worm<\/a>), I didn't want to to take any chances, and we had nothing to isolate or store it in, so we carefully squashed this one after taking photos then cleaned the plug hole with boiling water and cleaner. <\/p>\n\n<p>On squashing it, it burst in a very similar way to a recently-fed mosquito or bed bug with a splatter of what looked exactly like regular human/mammal blood. I've not seen this before from a worm. Each 5mm or so of worm body contained about as much blood as a well-fed mosquito.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've done a little browsing of species of bloodworm but didn't find any obvious matches.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This might be unrelated, but the bathroom in which this worm surfaced has for several weeks had a small but constantly replenishing population of tiny flies like this, which I never questioned because they look almost exactly like regular drain flies. There's usually 1-3 of these flies on any given day, even after wiping out all of yesterday's flies, and I've not seen them anywhere else in the country. In this image it's about 3mm from wingtip to wingtip - much smaller than the worm.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ct24G.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ct24G.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n","question_id":38875,"tags":["species-identification"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":38901,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":392,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1442577647},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f79f022bcac42e17312d7f2d522959e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16892,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16892/chris-chambers","reputation":118,"display_name":"Chris Chambers"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f79f022bcac42e17312d7f2d522959e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16892,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16892/chris-chambers","reputation":118,"display_name":"Chris Chambers"},"score":0,"post_id":38898,"edited":false,"creation_date":1442617031,"comment_id":64844,"body":"I understand that, I&#39;m using the term matrix because I am handling it with one programatically, but I&#39;m generating it with said match and mismatch values.

In many cases such as that of zinc finger proteins (ZF), sequence identification usually happens for dinucleotide pairs such that each finger (a modular unit) can identify a di/tri-nucleotide (Figure 2,3). An array of fingers in case of ZF and helices in case of Helix-Turn-Helix motifs can recognize a unique stretch of DNA sequence (which is certainly more unique than individual base pairs). Usually the binding of the fingers are co-operative which leads to increased affinity and specificity of the protein-DNA binding <sup>[2,3]<\/sup>. Analogous mechanism may exist for other kinds of DBD too (I haven't specifically looked for that). Moreover, many DNA motif binding proteins oligomerize, which is again co-operative.

Classical plant breeding is slow, imprecise and carries many traits of negative benefit.

Back-crosses to variety A are then necessary in order to make, in successive generations, offspring that are 75% A, then 87% A, then 93% A and so on.

It is important to know that ever since <em>homo sapiens<\/em> created the primitive form of agriculture called farming, we have been engaged in producing GMO plants. Every time a farmer select seeds form the plants that grew a little heartier in cold weather, or produced fruit just a little more juicy, it was a deliberate act to produce a higher quality crop (for some trait) the next season. The only difference between what we called and still call farming and GMO agricultural practices, is how finely controlled the individual genes are manipulated. The obvious by product from being able to sequence and manipulate a genome is that we can much more rapidly and broadly create and test new varietals at a pace that could have taken decades or generations earlier. This represents a very important opportunity to improve our quality of food and robustness of crops, and is just as \"natural\" as what has happened for 10,000 or so years.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1846,"question_id":1838,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d0dd6897969239195430ed5adf4db89?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":752,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/752/yotiao","reputation":396,"display_name":"yotiao"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35114dfb827dc71cb3a8ff281617c5b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/535/larry-parnell","reputation":3430,"display_name":"Larry_Parnell"},"score":0,"post_id":1849,"edited":false,"creation_date":1334664867,"comment_id":2389,"body":"I believe that there is a GMO potato now grown in Europe for paper production."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1334649775,"creation_date":1334649775,"body":"<p>I'd like to add that most of the GMOs that might most dramatically improve human condition (ie via drought/salt resistance, greatly increased yield or nutritional value) are all unfortunately still under development (or not even that), partially because of the general public resistance to GMO in some regions of the world (like Europe; anyone remembers the tomatoes?) and organized campaigns against GMO (not really fact-based; ie Greenpeace &amp; Co).<\/p>\n\n<p>So yes, GMO can lead to development of crops with increased nutritional value, better resistance to environmental conditions or changes and/or increased yield, but we're not there (yet).<\/p>\n\n<p>The above should not mean that what we have so far (insect resistant crops, disease-reducing GM insects or the golden rice) is not important, because it is, and it should not mean that the current legal/political context of GMO is fine, because it isn't.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1849,"question_id":1838,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kVLLx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16657,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16657/naveen-kumaar","reputation":58,"display_name":"Naveen Kumaar","accept_rate":17},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1442587694,"creation_date":1442587694,"body":"<p>Imagine an apple which won't get brownish (oxidised) after being cut..\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/86bim.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/86bim.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a>\nImagine a tomato which will not get wrinkles and will not perish for a long time<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ye48o.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ye48o.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a chicken and fish which gives more flesh in short incubation time \n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BE301.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BE301.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NAChX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NAChX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fcOWC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fcOWC.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In endocrinology to get one unit of growth hormone one have to get 1000 pituitaries from cadavers.\nImagine a bacteria which produces growth hormone and other hormones like insulin for therapeutic and research purposes<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a vaccine against flu in cow's milk and hepatitis in Banana.

I am reiterating the background of your question.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cas9 cuts the both the strands of the target DNA at the same location thereby making a blunt end cut. Usually sticky ends and microhomologous ends lead to indels because of exonucleolytic clipping and addition of extra bases by pol-µ. The question is how do indels arise during NHEJ mediated re-ligation of blunt ends.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>NHEJ may not always lead to indels. Most blunt end cuts can be repaired without error. Some non blunt cuts are also perfectly re-ligated; the best example for this is VDJ recombination. The binding of Ku proteins is essential for a perfect re-ligation (canonical NHEJ/C-NHEJ).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are some variant non-canonical pathways which include alternative-NHEJ, backup-NHEJ and microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ) (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004086\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bétermier et al. 2014<\/a>). Some studies also refer to all of these pathways as alternative-NHEJ or altNHEJ. These alternative pathways involve resection of nucleotides by exonucleases such as Mre11 to produce overhangs. Imperfect alignment of these overhangs prior to ligation leads to indels. Sometimes non-templated addition of nucleotide happens by the action of terminal deoxyribonuclotide transferase (TdT). Pol-µ can also add random nucleotides at the 3' end (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.biochem.052308.093131\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lieber 2010<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>In general, the propensity of DSBR via alternative NHEJ pathways would be higher when Ku activity is lower. Even with a moderate Ku activity, there is always some likelihood of alternative pathways in action. Moreover, it is to be noted that sticky end ligations are more efficient than blunt end ligations.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8PXvH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8PXvH.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup> Reproduced from <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004086\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Bétermier et al. 2014<\/em><\/a> <\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":38858,"question_id":38828,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1442555094}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38828/how-does-nhej-cause-indels","last_activity_date":1442555094,"creation_date":1442465980,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does NHEJ cause indels?","body":"<p>I was reading up on CRISPR-cas9 and how it works and I am having trouble wrapping my head around how NHEJ to repair the DSB can cause indels to occur.

Telomeres could be removed and just added back after the fact, as there is likely a standard length for each chromosome of the six nucleotide repeats. <\/li>\n<li>Though you could have a minimum of a two bit code, you would really need a larger data set. You would need metadata, so things like polarity of DNA and chromosome number. <\/li>\n<li>You might also want data about the alleles of each and every gene, that way any errors could be fixed. If you are making the DNA from a data set, there is no sense keeping any genetic defects or diseases in the sequence when you remake it.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>Craig Venter, one of the protagonists of the Human Genome Project has a company that is able to produce synthetic DNA for a whole organism. They have reportedly produced a synthetic bacterium, so in theory, they could print DNA from a database and recreate an entire genome, though at what cost and how long I am not sure.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The Original sequencing of the Human Genome did cost Billions of Dollars, however today's sequencing machines can produce an entire genomic sequence more in the range of thousands of dollars. I am not sure if they have broken the $1,000 threshold yet.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Most of the commercial companies do not produce full genomes. They likely do not even sequence a full exome (The areas of all genes that make up the coding sequences of mature mRNAs). They likely do some form of polymorphism analysis to determine if for any given gene you have certain allele other than the Wild Type allele. In this kind of analysis, you do not really need a full sequencing to determine what gene a person has, you only need to identify areas of key differences to determine what is what. That being said, the data collected by a commercial genetics company would likely not be sufficient to recreate an entire genome.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Another important factor is Epigenetics. Just because you have the entire base sequence of the person, doesn't necessarily mean that synthetically creating all 46 of that person's chromosomes would give you the necessary material to transfer into an enucleated oocyte to then produce a new person. You would likely also want to capture the epigenetic encoding as well as the full genome. The epigenetic code that you would likely want would be from one of the cells from the 8-cell stage of development I mentioned earlier. While we have been able to clone adult mammals by nuclear transfer, those animals have had issues with cancer and premature aging. This may have something to do with telomeres, but it also may have something to do with the epigenetic code in early development.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There are other considerations in development as well. There is exchange of nutrients between mother and fetus during development. There is also a sharing of immunity and probably hormonal signals from the mother that can effect development.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Also women are mosaics. A woman would also have the added challenge that every single one of her cells has one of her two X chromosomes inactivated, so depending on which one is inactivated, at random, will determine which of the two X alleles she will be expressing in that cell. It is very possible that her clone would be different from her in appearance.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>That is a pretty extensive list. I probably have missed some things. One thing I have definitely left out are all of the structural proteins of chromatin and how to package the DNA into a nucleus. We do not yet understand all of the mechanisms to compact DNA down into a nucleus, so we would have to answer all of those questions before we could figure out how to print and package the DNA to make a clone of a person from a database of their genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>As we have not currently cloned a human, then it is difficult to say if it is possible. Things that we can do, even in other mammals do not always translate to humans and human cells. There would also be significant ethical hurdles to overcome and based on the current sentiments, it is unlikely, even if we have the technology, that society would allow human clones to be produced.<\/p>\n","answer_id":38870,"question_id":38864,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1442546609}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38864/what-dna-has-the-most-info-for-getting-a-persons-likeness","last_activity_date":1442546609,"creation_date":1442526894,"answer_count":1,"title":"What DNA has the most info for getting a person's likeness?","body":"<p>I understand that DNA can come from hair but also from other places.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's suppose a person gets their DNA mapped by a company (there are some companies claiming to offer analysis of DNA.. e.g. maybe $200 and maybe some may send the DNA on a DVD)<\/p>\n\n<p>I understand from this link that human DNA should fit on a DVD <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8954571/how-much-memory-would-be-required-to-store-human-dna\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8954571/how-much-memory-would-be-required-to-store-human-dna<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Would it be possible to get a person's likeness..  if not now, then in future, based on the DNA I might be able to get sent to me digitally.<\/p>\n\n<p>And presumably the DNA of a 28 year old would be the most ideal for getting (in a computer program) the likeness/image of that person at 28 - the age the DNA was taken?  <\/p>\n\n<p>I hear of the cost of sequencing the human genome to be millions or billions..

However, if you look at birth statistics your find that boys are slightly more likely to be born then girls.   <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/30/396384911/why-are-more-baby-boys-born-than-girls\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article talks a little about how it happens<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>If it was truly advantageous for an even sex ratio to exist at birth I imagine we would have evolved to make that happen, by slightly favoring more female sperm or by having the processes that decides which embryos to spontaneously abort be stricter for males embryos then females.  For that matter since it's more important for males to be exceptionally healthy then it is for females, since males have to compete for a mate while females don't, you would think more strict filtering for 'bad' embryos in the case of males then females would make sense anyways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus I'm inclined to think that the increased number of males to females is not random evolutionary fluke, but adaptive.  I'm wondering what would cause there to be a benefit for males to be slightly more common then females.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know males are more likely to die in childhood, due to risk taking activities to impress the females, so could it be that the increase in males is due to the expectation that more males will die before reaching sexual maturity?  I'm not certain I buy this logic, it doesn't seem you should favor a sex any more because it's likely to take higher risks.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know that strong/healthy mates would prefer males and weak ones prefer females, since strong males would out compete weak males for mates it's good to have strong males that can achieve multiple mates and weak females since their guaranteed to have at least one mate.  Is it possible that our increased nutrition and health of recent generations simply results in more males because our bodies judge each of us as 'healthy' compared to the standard that existed for 99% of our evolution, ie, evolution hasn't caught up with technology when judging health to decide which sex to favor?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there some more obvious explanation for why favoring males slightly would be adaptive in humans?<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: I want to stress again, I'm not asking <em>how<\/em> the bias happens.

Many other populations of Central-Southern Italy were created by the mixing of local and foreign elements dating back to the previous millennium; it is the case of the <strong>Sabines<\/strong> and <strong>Latini<\/strong> who settled in Lazio together with <strong>Falisci<\/strong>, <strong>Aequi, Volsci, Hernici and Ausones<\/strong>. The interior of Abruzzo was dominated by the <strong>Vestini, Paeligni and Marsi<\/strong>, while the central Adriatic coast was populated by <strong>Picentes, Marrucini and Frentani<\/strong>.

One that is easily demonstrated (first documented in 1733) is the effect of intrathoracic (chest) pressure on circulation. The blood pressure of healthy people falls during spontaneous inspiration. When someone takes a deep breath, the blood return to the heart via the vena cava decreases, and pressure is exerted on the right atrium. Both cause decreased filling, which will drop blood pressure. Although this is best demonstrated with a blood pressure cuff, it can be demonstrated without. An unrecommended method is exemplified in a childhood game of <em>passing out<\/em>. A Valsalva maneuver (deep breath and glottal closure) decreases blood flow to the heart.
