However, it is important to consider the size of the resulting clones. At that early stage of embryogenesis only ~ half (or less) of those cells will go on to contribute to the fetus, the rest will form the placenta. Also at this stage each cell is likely totipotent, and capable of contributing to all of the different tissues, but eventually the daughters of these cells will become committed, or determined in their developmental lineage. Depending on how much mixing of cells occurs prior to determination, I think it unlikely that within one retina the cone cells would originate from more than a single clone--so I would think that either they all are + or the all are mutant. Since there is L-R symmetry between the two optic cups that will give rise to the developing eyes, I think it is more likely that one female could have one eye that is mutant and one eye that is +.  Given that the prevalence of red-green color-blindness in males approaches 7 % of the population, we can infer that heterozygous females are very common, yet to the best of my knowledge there are not millions of females with partial color-blindness--they either have it (m/m), or they don't (+/+ &amp; m/+). So I think a mosaic female with one eye color-blind and one eye normal must be exceedingly rare.\nRe: autosomal dominant diseases, it all depends on the tissue(s) and the affected developmental stage.

In fact, tetrachromats often show increased error rates in their color discrimination. In dichromatic New World monkeys the heterozygous females do functionally benefit from their extra cone as they gain trichromatic vision.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anomalous trichromats<\/a><\/strong> have all of their three cone types to perceive colors, but one type of cone perceives light slightly out of alignment. There are three different types of effect produced depending upon which cone type is affected.<\/p>\n\n<p>The different anomalous conditions are <em>protanomaly<\/em> (reduced sensitivity to red light), <em>deuteranomaly<\/em> (reduced green sensitivity - the most common type) and <em>tritanomaly<\/em> (reduced blue sensitivity - extremely rare). People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly are collectively known as <strong>red-green colour blind<\/strong> and they generally have difficulty distinguishing between reds, greens, browns and oranges. They also commonly confuse different types of blue and purple hues. Red and green cones are indeed coded on the <strong>X-chromosome<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>One source of variation is the very common Ser180Ala polymorphism that accounts for two spectrally different red pigments and that plays an important role in variation in normal color vision as well as defective color vision. The most common source of variation is the existence of several types of red/green pigment chimeras. The red and green-pigment genes are arranged in an array on the X-chromosome with one red-pigment gene followed by one or more green-pigment genes. Recombination events have given rise to red/green hybrid genes and deletion of the green-pigment genes. Only the first two genes in the tandem are expressed. The severity of red-green color vision defects is inversely proportional to the difference between the wavelengths of maximal absorption of the photopigments encoded by these two genes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Females who are heterozygous for red and green pigment genes that encode three\nspectrally distinct photopigments have the potential for <strong>enhanced color vision<\/strong>, as they are effectively tetrachromats (<a href=\"http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/staff/j.vangisbergen/endnote/endnotepdfs/colleges/NEUROBIOFYSICA/HC%20colleges/plaatjes%20en%20files/vision/kleurenzien/DEEB_hybride-genen-kleur.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deeb, 2005<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/252/5008/971.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neitz <em>et al<\/em>., 1991<\/a>). However, sensitive color-contrast testing on 43 tetrachromats has revealed that most of these females have no deviating color-discrimination whatsoever. 8 subjects showed relatively small effects, while only one showed a clear increased sensitivity in a narrow range of frequencies. It is believed that the <strong>human visual system is not plastic enough to cope with the extra spectral input<\/strong>. In fact, in the group there was an overall increase in error rates on some color tests (pseudoisochromatic plates, and Nagel anomaloscope color matching) <a href=\"http://www.imbs.uci.edu/~kjameson/JordanMollon1993.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Jordan &amp; Mollon, 1993)<\/a>.       <\/p>\n\n<p>In New World Monkeys, however, the situation is different. <strong>Squirrel monkeys are basically a dichromatic species<\/strong>, but two-thirds of the females are heterozygous, and <strong>gain trichromatic vision<\/strong> by expressing two of three possible alleles coding for pigments in the middle- to long-wave range of the spectrum. X-chromosome inactivation serves to segregate the alternative allelic products in different subsets of cones. The <strong>visual system<\/strong> of the heterozygous female is apparently <strong>plastic enough to take advantage of the presence of three classes of cone<\/strong>, because heterozygous monkeys have enhanced <strong>color selectivity in the red-green range<\/strong> that are impossible for all males and for homozygous females.

About the two that concerns you:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Pathway modules<\/strong> represent groups of functionally related enzymes part of the metabolic network. I think this one is easy to understand because it represents the classical understanding of \"module\". The modules involve metabolites (compounds with id starting with \"C\"), enzymes (represented by KEGG ortholog ids starting with \"K\") and reactions (represented by ids starting with \"R\").

We\n  established a 150 m wide × 250 m long transect at each dam and\n  determined the felling angle of at least 100 aspen trees cut in each\n  transect.

The land around Alum Creek Lake generally slopes toward the water, so to direct the fall of a tree towards the water a beaver should cut a symmetrical tree from the downhill side. Cutting from the downhill side occurred for trees >9.0 m from the water. Near the shore, trees tended to lean toward the water and would fall toward the water regardless of the side from which the beaver cut. At distances &lt;9-0 m from shore, beavers cut predominantly from the uphill side where it should be easy to sit and there is little danger of the tree falling on them. At all distances, beavers showed random orientation when cutting trees on shallow slopes (&lt;20°), whereas on steep slopes (especially slopes >30°) they cut predominantly from the uphill side. Beavers cut small trees (&lt;5.0 cm diameter) mostly from the downhill side, but tended to cut trees >5.0 cm in diameter from the uphill side.

Giving birth to live young is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary\">vivipary<\/a>.

(Anguis fragilis is an example of ovo-viviparity.) In the sea\n  horse, zygotes are retained in the male\u2019s ventral \"marsupium\". In the\n  frog Rhinoderma darwinii, the zygotes developed in the vocal sac. In\n  the frog Rheobatrachus, zygotes developed in the stomach. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Histotrophic\n  viviparity: the zygotes developed in the female\u2019s oviducts, but find\n  their nutriments by oophagy or adelphophagy (intra-uterine cannibalism\n  in some sharks or in the black salamander Salamandra atra).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Hemotrophic viviparity: nutriments are provided by the female, often\n  through placenta. In the frog Gastrotheca ovifera, embryos are fed by\n  the mother through specialized gills. <strong>The lizard Pseudomoia\n  pagenstecheri and most mammals exhibit a hemotrophic viviparity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Though it is true that most <strong>typically we would associate egg laying with animals with ears \"inside\" such as birds and snakes, there are some examples that are not this way<\/strong>.

Therefore, you could make the statement about external ears (also more common to mammals) using any other mammal specific body plan.

This beastie has no external ears (or external testicles for that matter),it has tiny ear slits instead and it lays eggs. So, even this extreme weirdo seems to follow the ears (or testicles) on the inside means eggs rule.

Usually the hormones targeted are auxins and cytokinins which are both involved in the regulation of normal growth patterns; disrupting these patterns leads to disorganised growth, or in some cases a differently organised growth. There are several methods that I know of:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The gall inducer directly synthesising the hormone.<\/li>\n<li>The inducer chemically inducing the host to synthesise more hormone.<\/li>\n<li>The inducer chemically inducing the host to transport more hormone to the site.<\/li>\n<li>The inducer genetically modifying the host to cause synthesis of the hormone in the host cell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Some examples of the different methods:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Direct production:<\/strong> The bacterium <em>Pseudomonas savastanoi<\/em> directly produces indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, a type of auxin). This direct accumulation has been shown to be responsible for gall formation in oleander knot disease. Some key papers: Palm et al. 1989, link 1; Glickman et al. 1998, link 2.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chemical induction of transport:<\/strong> Root-knot nematode worms induce root gall formation in clover. They probably do so by producing flavonoids which up-regulate transportation of auxin into cells (see link 3).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic induction:<\/strong> As already mentioned by Amy, <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens<\/em> is a very well characterised example of induction by genetic modification, however, <em>A. tumefaciens<\/em> is also known to directly produce auxins in large quantities. Another interesting example of genetic modification is in viral gall-inducers. They are not so well studied as their bacterial counterparts, but in some cases (e.g. white clover mosaic potexvirus) it has been shown that virus infection initially leads to a complex change in the types of cytokinins produced by the plant (e.g. Clarke, 1999; see link 4). It has also been shown that if cytokinins are applied exogenously (i.e. injected into the plant) after viral infection, that the virus cannot replicate well. This suggests that the virus is manipulating the host's hormone production in a complex way.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is also the interesting case of <em>Rhodococcus fascians<\/em>, which seems to produce a chemical which is not structurally similar to any known cytokinin, and yet has similar effects (Goethals et al., 2001; link 5).<\/p>\n\n<p>You specifically asked about gall wasps, but unfortunately this mechanism is, as far as I can tell, not completely known. It is speculated (e.g. in Shorthouse &amp; Rohrfritsch, 1992; link 6) that this involves direct injection of phytohormones. The evidence to support this is simply that other insects, particularly aphids, excrete phytohormones in their salivary sheaths when they inject them into a plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'll just say that the fact that gall induction is carried out by bacteria, viruses, nematodes, fungi and wasps, and that some mechanisms are shared across all those associations,  demonstrates the ability of evolution to converge on the most elegant solution to a problem. It also shows that plants are so great, everyone wants a piece (but I would say that, because I'm a plant biologist).<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC209694/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC209694/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.2.156\">http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.2.156<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=PP98157\">http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=PP98157<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/120/2/547.full\">http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/120/2/547.full<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.phyto.39.1.27\">http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.phyto.39.1.27<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nhbs.com/biology_of_insect_induced_galls_tefno_3838.html\">http://www.nhbs.com/biology_of_insect_induced_galls_tefno_3838.html<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":860,"question_id":761,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1328130999}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/761/how-do-plant-galls-form","last_activity_date":1436511977,"creation_date":1327283099,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do plant galls form?","body":"<p>I am curious how Gall Wasps, bacteria and other organisms induce <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall\">galls<\/a> to form. <\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, what chemicals induce gall formation?<\/p>\n","question_id":761,"tags":["botany"],"score":16,"accepted_answer_id":860,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1139,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1436511977},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2eaf1a37aabbfa11fd3ef0fad525ab3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":16687,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16687/linda-marie","reputation":14,"display_name":"Linda Marie"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":4,"post_id":35932,"edited":false,"creation_date":1436480172,"comment_id":59240,"body":"Welcome to Biology.SE.

In effect, more apical parts of the cochlea are exposed less frequently to (damaging) sound stimuli, while the <strong>base of the cochlea is exposed to all sounds entering the inner ear<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, <strong>chemical exposure and acoustic wear and tear<\/strong> may be more prominent in the cochlear base, which can explain why <strong>presbyacusis starts at the very high frequencies and progresses to low frequencies<\/strong> (upward in the cochlea) from there.         <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/537/The-analysis-of-sound-frequencies-by-the-basilar-membrane\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Brittanica* The-analysis-of-sound-frequencies-by-the-basilar-membrane<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/7/2115.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kujawa &amp; Liberman, <em>J Neurosci<\/em> 2006; 26:2115-23<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.psypress.com/cw/mather-9781841696997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mather, Foundations of Perception, 2009<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596108/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schacht et al, Anat Rec Hoboken 2013; 295:1837-50<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FHuib_Versnel%2Fpublication%2F47660604_Effects_of_electrical_stimulation_on_the_acoustically_evoked_auditory-nerve_response_in_guinea_pigs_with_a_high-frequency_hearing_loss%2Flinks%2F0c96053cd1c55581f2000000&amp;ei=JYe8VJjTO-PPmwX_4oGQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHO_pbdR5L3pW2btsnZGDdtEo-iLA&amp;sig2=S1nw5B9anvl__Iwy7eNgLA&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.dGY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stronks et al, Hear Res 2011; 272:95-107<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":27824,"question_id":27822,"up_vote_count":31,"last_edit_date":1436453601}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27822/why-do-adults-lose-hearing-at-high-frequencies","last_activity_date":1436453601,"creation_date":1421638440,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do adults lose hearing at high frequencies?","body":"<p>Children and teens can hear high pitched sounds that adults can't hear anymore.

To any others experienced with closure, I am certainly skipping plenty of steps and ideas in attempt to convey the general.<\/p>\n\n<p>******A general warning that graphic surgical images are used below.******<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Setup:<\/h2>\n\n<p>You asked about \"severed\" jugular and carotid injuries, so we will focus on neck injuries, with a focus on insults to the R/L <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery\">common carotid arteries (CCA)<\/a> and the R/L <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein\">internal jugular vein (IJV)<\/a>.  To get everyone on the same page visually, we are talking about the large blood vessels in this image:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/B5Tzn.png\" alt=\"dissection of human neck\"><\/p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will deal with injuries that are focused directly on these vessels.  In reality, there are so many different and important tissues tightly packed in the neck that there are often many complications and multiple vessels that need to be dealt with near simultaneously.  Further, we will suppose that our patient (pt) is unlucky to have a \"severed\" vessel in his neck, but lucky enough to have immediate access to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Trauma_Life_Support\">ATLS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just like you should have learned in your basic neighborhood CPR/aid class, you address the ABC's (MD's add DE): <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28medicine%29\"><strong>A<\/strong> irway, <strong>B<\/strong> reathing, <strong>C<\/strong> irculation<\/a> (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S28478\"><strong>D<\/strong> isability, <strong>E<\/strong> xposure<\/a>).  In reality when presented with a pt bleeding from the neck, you will almost always begin by applying pressure at the wound site, while you address the airway.  When I say \"applying pressure\" I literally mean a nurse or medic putting their fingers up against where it is bleeding and trying to stop it like a hose.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will assume that a clear airway is established, the pt is breathing normally enough, and under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia\">general anaesthesia<\/a>.  We will also give us the advantage of having the head, and to a little lesser extent body, packed down with ice.  This will give us precious time, and help <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2013.03.03\">prevent brain damage<\/a>.  All else is presumed to be well with the pt, and all we need to do is fix the bleed in his neck.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Identifying the problem:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Now that we have our idealized pt ready to fix, the first thing you have to do is to identify where the bleed is.  Assuming you have serious bleeding, like one would come from a \"severed\" CCA or IJV that normally means cutting open the wound quickly and in a controlled manner.  Again, the neck is full of tissue you don't want to damage, so a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior\">anterior<\/a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle\">sternocleidomastoid<\/a> incision is <a href=\"http://www.acssurgery.com/acssurgery/institutional/getChapterByIDHTML.action?chapId=part07_ch04&amp;type=tab\">normally called for<\/a> when you are looking for where the CCA or IJV is damaged.  As opposed to coming from the top the way we would dissect a cadaver (as in the drawing above), the sternocleidomastoid incision will give us a side view into the neck like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sY24T.jpg\" alt=\"anterior sternocleidomastoid incision\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The point at this stage is to <a href=\"http://www.trauma.org/archive/vascular/PVTmanage.html\">gain control of the bleed<\/a>.  You don't want to just go digging in where the vessel is bleeding, because you are likely to cause more damage than help (and in this case, loose the pt).  Instead you are going to clamp above and below where the vessel is bleeding.  This will let you suck out the blood and see what's going on.  If you happen to have a large wound in a large vein, there's a chance that a clamp won't give you sufficient control of the bleeding.  In that case you have to also use a catheter to stop the bleeding (<a href=\"http://www.acssurgery.com/acssurgery/institutional/getChapterByIDHTML.action?chapId=part07_ch04&amp;type=tab\">in obtaining distil control to be specific<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>In our case, this means dissecting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_sheath\">carotid sheath<\/a>.  This needs to be done very carefully so that you don't damage the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve\">vagus nerve<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed I kept putting \"severed\" in quotes.  That's because it matters how the vessels are damaged.  Were they crushed or ground apart? Cut jagged or cleanly? Transverse or longitudinal?  All of these change the exact procedures into how you go forward.  Clearly a vessel that has a small tear is easier to repair than one that has been totally separated with jagged shredding from a crush injury.  Veins and arteries won't retract from the insult in the same way either, so how you find them can be a bit different.  Here is a flow chart that shows the basic decisions:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lIOuJ.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Put it back together Doc: [warning of graphic images]<\/h2>\n\n<p>You may notice that there are basically two end points for either veins or arteries: repair it or ligate it.  There are many different technical/specific ways either can be done, but those are beyond the scope of this answer.  If the sight of open wounds bothers you, note I am going to start using actual surgical photos below.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it's possible it's better to repair the vessel.  That means that you can close the artery where it is.  If there is just a small hole, you can suture the hole closed.  With the CCA or IJV it's more likely that you are going to need a patch.  This means that you take another piece of vein or a synthetic replacement, and suture it into the hole.  I always like to tell people surgery is a lot more tailoring than most people realize (not that this is as easy as sewing fabric).  Below is an example of where a patch would be used in the CCA:<\/p>\n\n<p>First the tear in the artery:<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P5h0r.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>And after the patch has been added:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tLzE2.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Suturing and patching can only be used to close the vessels when tension isn't needed to repair the wound.  If the laceration or severing of the vessels are such that it has come mostly (not completely) apart, but you can still get the ends together with NO tension,  end-to-end anastomosis repair can be utilized.  This means that you take the two ends, with branches if there are any at the wound, and suture them back together.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again here is an example of the opening in the artery (popliteal):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1wWGA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>And here it is again after end-to-end anastomosis repair:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4fqsY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's say that you really did get the vessel cut in half.  That's a bit of bad news for you, you're going to have to ligate the vessel.  That means sewing up the end of it to close it down.  You start above the injury in arteries and below in veins, and then you tie at least three loops--many prefer five loops--down on the vein, and make a clean cut leaving at least two loops on the part staying in the body.  Then you do the same thing on the other side of the injury.  I think this is best displayed by a video, unfortunately most of the good ones I know of are not available to the public.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cEnVlwKkZY\">This video<\/a> certainly not the best technique I've ever seen but it get's the idea across.  I will search for a better video as I have time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if it is possible, a surgeon will try to make a graft deal with the ligation.  The first choice is a <a href=\"http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/338141.html\">interposition graft<\/a>.  This means taking a larger vein graft and connecting the two ends of the severed vessel.  You do this after making clean ends with the ligations from above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here we have the femoral artery prepped for an interposition graft:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KQbSJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>And here is interposition graft in place:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dOM3n.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In certain cases, this is not possible.  As strange as it sounds, the ligation may just be left in place, depending on where it is.  <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Is that all?<\/h2>\n\n<p>No, not by a long shot, but that is the basics.  There are many different techniques that can be used, with new and better ones being invented often.  For example instead of suturing, chemical cauterizing of the ligation can be used and is quicker.  That also allows the surgery to be done through a scope.  But the basics remain the same:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Stop the bleeding, gain basic access, get full control of the bleeding, obtain full exposure/access, sew up the problem,<\/strong> put everything back, close up, give fluids, and send them to ICU.  Even after getting everything right in surgery, the recovery can be quite difficult.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Sources and Further Reading<\/h2>\n\n<p>Note: I will try to come back with primary sources, I started from knowing what to do and searched for sources.

For instance: sharks are pretty much the same shape they were millions of years ago, but they've been accumulating genetic differences 'invisibly' that allows us to group the different kinds of shark accurately. Where genetic data is unavailable (paleontology as a rule, certain kinds of field taxonomy where it's cheaper to code the morphological features of each new beetle than sequence them all) morphological trees are still used. So in terms of which tree type is more common: It depends.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of which tree type is more accepted, it's genetic data by a landslide. Genetic data by and large is much less affected by homologous structures and convergent evolution. In addition, it works on species that all look pretty much identical (imagine trying to code hundreds of bacterial species that are all closely related). Using highly conserved cellular machinery, trees for very distant species can be constructed. Using unconserved noncoding sequences trees for very closely related individuals trees can be constructed with a reasonable degree of accuracy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some examples: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve\">Mitochondrial Eve<\/a> would be impossible to date with morphological characters.

The Pacinian corpuscles (and hair follicle receptors) are of the rapidly adapting type. These receptors swiftly become unresponsive (they adapt) when a pressure stimulus is applied, but faithfully transmit rapidly changing stimuli (such as vibrations).<\/p>\n\n<p>Pacinian corpuscles are specialized vibration receptors.

If this capsule is dissected from the receptor and a pressure stimulus is directly applied to the sensor element underneat the capsule, the receptor response to a sustained stimulus substantially increases <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1713151\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Mendelson &amp; Loewenstein, 1964)<\/a>. Basically, these elastic lamellae mold their shape to the stimulus and pressure stimuli are only transmitted for a few milliseconds, after which the lamellae absorb the pressure. So only a one or a few spikes are generated at the start of a pressure stimulus. Upon release of the pressure stimulus another spike or two are generated. Hence, a continued pressure stimulus is not faithfully reproduced. However, vibratory stimuli generate spikes on the pressure onset as well as offset as well, and this happens on every phase of the vibration. Hence, vibratory stimuli are faithfully transmitted.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ei1tn.jpg\" alt=\"PC response\"><br>\n<sup>Response of Pacinian corpuscle to a sustained pressure stimulus (indentation of the skin) and superimposed vibratory stimuli.

Bash (or other shell) is essential. While one can replace Python with C or Java and eventually replace R by Python or Julia, I find Bash to be really necessary. To compare Python to R, Python is much faster. If you are a purist, you'll like Python much more than R. R is a weird language, I use it a lot but you always have to deal with very special kind of objects. The big advantage of R is its community; There are tons and tons of functions. Typically, for any task you you want to do and related to statistics or to phylogenetics, you'll find an already existing package that will do the job for you. C is nice and very popular. It is super fast but it is not super handy for most tasks. Moreover, C doesn't have an interpreter which is always kinda annoying when you're use to high level languages such as R typically. I know nobody who uses Ruby and I don't code in Ruby but it is an important language. Some may use it for bioinformatics and it is very much used in many other disciplines (unlike R, which only statisticians know).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What I personally use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, I use mostly R, Python, C/C++ and Bash. Bash to organize stuff, modify files and manage processes on my machine and on remote machines. R for data analysis. Python when R is too slow (to analyze more data such as sequence data for example) and C/C++ to run individual based simulation. I happen to use some other languages for my work but not as often.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How to learn<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Nobody excels at coding to start with. Actually, after my first class of programming I had in mind that programming was not meant for me. Now, I don't excel, I am just a biologist who codes a bit and not a computer scientist but I spend the majority of time coding and I love that. I learn a lot everyday but ever since I started to feel a bit confident, I found that I could do much with this knowledge. You'll probably realize after some time that few people are really good at coding and you can already do much with only a few days of training. Don't be afraid. I think that indeed one of the best way to learn a language is to use it for a project. Here are a bunch of things you could do:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Go on Dryad.com, get some data and analyze them. You can redo the analysis they did on the original paper for example. Or, better you could try to discover something by yourself by combining some existing data.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>individual-based (OOP) simulations in population genetics<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>simulate genetic drift in populations. Try to estimate the probability of a new mutation to fix and the time it takes to get fixed.<\/li>\n<li>Simulate the process of selective sweep with defining chromosomes.<\/li>\n<li>You'd basically have to have a function that creates a list of objects of type individuals. Each individual has two objects called chromosomes. You have a function that simulate reproduction (without selection, recombination nor mutations to start with). And you need a function to print the statistics you need on a file. I think you could do a simple individual-based simulation in a few days only and then you'd feel more comfortable with the language and you would also have a better grasp on how one can numerically simulate a population through time.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":35881,"question_id":35875,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1436348551}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35875/what-are-the-programming-languages-important-to-learn-for-a-geneticist-or-bioinf","last_activity_date":1436348551,"creation_date":1436311533,"answer_count":2,"title":"What are the programming languages important to learn for a geneticist or bioinformatician?","body":"<p>I am interested in learning more about both genomics and bioinformatics, with emphasis on genomics.

The most used scaffold protein is an N-terminal truncation of apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1), which is the primary protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. But because the size of the scaffold protein defines the size of the nanodisc, membrane proteins with different size could require different type of scaffold protein.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reconstitution of a membrane protein into a lipid disc is a self assembled process. The reaction consists in mixing the membrane protein solubilised in detergent with lipids (that can be chosen according to the protein) and the scaffold protein.

For small strains(amount of deformation) flesh isn't that springy and mostly \"flows\" like water. When you pressurize the cuff around the arm, the flesh of the arm equilibrates to the cuff pressure the way balloons equilibrate to the air pressure, only less dramatically because water is mostly incompressible.

(The cuff works by exerting a relative pressure difference on part of your body.) At high altitude the sphygmanometer is still accurate-ish because the cuff pressure relative to the atmosphere is still the same as the blood pressure, relative to the atmosphere. If you had air for blood(or any compressible fluid) your veins would collapse underwater. This is why your ears hurt while diving deeply if you don't equalize them: your ear is full of compressible air, and at depth the air attempts to shrink more than the flesh around it, pulling things out of place painfully.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35822,"question_id":35817,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1436282202}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35817/how-does-pressure-measured-by-sphygmomanometer-translate-directly-to-blood-press","last_activity_date":1436282202,"creation_date":1436186413,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does pressure measured by sphygmomanometer translate directly to blood pressure?","body":"<p>As per my understanding a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer\" rel=\"nofollow\">sphygmomanometer<\/a> when wrapped around the arm and inflated only measures the <strong>pressure of the air inside the cuff<\/strong>, doesn't it?

In short: you can tell how oxygenated the blood is by its color, but you have to correct for how much blood there is: The dilation of the arterioles and capillaries with the heartbeat increases the size of the area being measured, and changes all sorts of properties including conductance.

However, the jugular venous pressure is the pressure of the internal jugular vein that drains the head, and that has heartbeat oscillations (not one-to-one, there are \"echoes\" and other weirdnesses because it's almost connected to the heart.

You are\n   sloughing millions of skin cells each day, but for a nail the dead\n   cells all mass together. Nails only wear away or must be trimmed.\n   Individual cells are not lost. <strong>The solidity of the nail comes from the\n   connecting of the dead cells together by junctions between the cells\n   called desmosomes<\/strong>, and by the interlocking of the cells like jigsaw\n   puzzle pieces. But there\u2019s more.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Individual keratin protein filaments also become connected so that the entire mass of keratin becomes one solid structure. This is called cornification, like the stratum corneum (the outer, dead layers) of your skin.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>One of the two main forms of keratin in your nails is crystalline keratin, which is rigid, stronger, and has an ordered structure - like a tinker toy cube. <strong>Transmitted light is less likely to strike an atom and bounce back when the atoms are all lined up, so this is why many crystalline lattices appear translucent.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":35791,"question_id":35780,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1436241441}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35780/what-is-the-cause-of-colours-of-nail","last_activity_date":1436241441,"creation_date":1436078137,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is the cause of colours of nail","body":"<p>Why the nails are of white colour from bottom? then why they are pink and again white in the end?<\/p>\n","question_id":35780,"tags":["pigmentation"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":148,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/034fee90c4f1dc7e75310e84866ea3d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":16623,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16623/a-guest","reputation":16,"display_name":"A Guest"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c66c4d97a7bc3859a85253f003e1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"moderator","user_id":6,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6/mad-scientist","reputation":6781,"display_name":"Mad Scientist","accept_rate":55},"score":1,"post_id":35840,"edited":false,"creation_date":1436280165,"comment_id":59019,"body":"You might want to look at <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936974/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article about how Lipemia causes interference with some tests<\/a>."}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35840/do-high-triglycerides-invalidate-tests-for-infections","last_activity_date":1436237540,"creation_date":1436237540,"answer_count":0,"title":"Do High Triglycerides Invalidate Tests for Infections?","body":"<p>Blood donation websites tell you to avoid eating fats a few days before the donation, because when there is a lot of fat in the blood, they can't test for infectious diseases and must discard the blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does that mean that if you have, say, high triglycerides, the result of an infection disease blood test will be invalid?

The probability that a single channel is <em>conducting<\/em> is the product $r^{n_1}s^{n_2}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>$r^{n_1}$ describes the \"activation\" process, while $s^{n_2}$ describes the \"inactivation\" process. These are two separate processes, with the activation process now known to be driven by voltage-dependent changes in the configuration of transmembrane domains of the channel protein, while the inactivation process is a charged part of the protein inside the cell that more slowly moves to block the channel when the cell is depolarized. See <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gating_currents\" rel=\"nofollow\">this summary<\/a> by Clay Armstrong, who contributed much to our understanding of these processes.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in the terminology here, a channel can be \"open\" (in terms of the $r$ process) but still \"inactivated\" (through the $s$ process) and thus be <em>non-conducting<\/em>. It can also be \"closed\" (in terms of the $r$ process) and \"inactivated\", in which case it is also <em>non-conducting<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The way this is modeled is that $s=1$ means <em>no<\/em> inactivation, while $s=0$ means <em>fully inactivated<\/em>. So that covers question 3. This is in contrast to the activation process, in which $r=1$ is full activation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Question 4 might be a bit misleading as there may be a hidden assumption that you are starting from being at potential $u_0$ for a long-enough time and then increasing $u$ suddenly (which is how action potentials normally are generated). In that case your understanding of differential equations should make it clear that $\\tau_r$ and $\\tau_s$ are the time constants for the responses of the $r$ and $s$ processes to a change in $u$. The process with a shorter time constant responds more quickly, so activation precedes inactivation (on the average). The different powers associated with the $r$ and $s$ processes ($n_1,n_2$) might confuse things a bit, but try running this model and you should be convinced.<\/p>\n\n<p>This might seem convoluted at first, but Hodgkin and Huxley worked out this model based solely on their electophysiological studies (with help from Bernard Katz). It's amazing how this model's postulates of multiple single channels and separate activation and inactivation processes have been so well verified at the molecular level over the past decades.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35834,"question_id":35797,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35797/hodgin-huxley-model-for-a-single-neuron","last_activity_date":1436222857,"creation_date":1436118394,"answer_count":1,"title":"Hodgin-Huxley model for a single neuron","body":"<p>I am viewing (through <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">edX<\/a> ) an introduction course to computational neuroscience.

Of course, there are certainly examples of the opposite as well, with predators killing &amp; consuming young prey on a fairly regular basis.

This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are the loosely bound organic cofactors, often called coenzymes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Each class of group-transfer reaction is carried out by a particular cofactor, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. An example of this are the dehydrogenases that use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a cofactor. Here, hundreds of separate types of enzymes remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ to NADH. This reduced cofactor is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that require electrons to reduce their substrates.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, these cofactors are continuously recycled as part of metabolism. As an example, the total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole. This ATP is constantly being broken down into ADP, and then converted back into ATP. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75 kg. In typical situations, humans use up their body weight of ATP over the course of the day. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times daily.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)#Cofactors_as_metabolic_intermediates\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>If you did not like that explanation of cofactors maybe you will this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whole foods offer three main benefits over dietary supplements:<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Greater nutrition<\/strong>. Whole foods are complex, containing a variety of the micronutrients your body needs \u2014 not just one.

A vitamin C supplement lacks these other micronutrients.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Essential fiber<\/strong>. Whole foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, provide dietary fiber. Most high-fiber foods are also packed with other essential nutrients. Fiber, as part of a healthy diet, can help prevent certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and it can also help manage constipation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Protective substances<\/strong>. Whole foods contain other substances important for good health. Fruits and vegetables, for example, contain naturally occurring substances called phytochemicals, which may help protect you against cancer, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.

Micronutrients are the vitamins like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vitamin A<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vitamin B<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vitamin C<\/a>, etc. but it's also trace elements like zinc, iron, iodine, and many other metals that the body requires in very small quantities.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the part of the diet that most people actually overlook, and is what pills like the \"once-a-day\" vitamin are intended to supplement.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Macronutrients<\/h2>\n\n<p>Much of what we get from food falls in the category of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient\" rel=\"nofollow\">macronutrients<\/a>\". These nutrients are the actual building blocks of the body - things like fats, proteins, calcium, carbon, hydrogen, etc. A lot of macronutrients are required on a daily basis, and it would be difficult to condense these into a pill form. An average-sized pill would have to be taken 5-6 times a day in order to provide even a less-than-average amount of macronutrients for the average person.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Digestion<\/h2>\n\n<p>The human body is designed to be an engine. The act of eating is hard-coded into human physiology, and the act of digesting food kick-starts a great many processes throughout the body. Digestion is a rather efficient process, and it's one that only works properly when it has enough food to break down. A handful of pills could never fuel this process correctly, since they would simply dissolve in the stomach and never require any kind of breaking down.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Psychological<\/h2>\n\n<p>Lastly, food &amp; drink have a psychological component to them as well. The human brain is wired so that it desires food on a psychological level. The physical act of eating something soothes that desire in a way that a pill never could. One of the greatest obstacles to someone trying to lose weight is this very component - even when their body technically has what it needs from vitamins, supplements, or shakes, this psychological aspect of hunger makes them want food anyway.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35830,"question_id":20992,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20992/why-cant-you-just-take-a-vitamin-why-you-need-a-healthy-diet-on-top-of-that","last_activity_date":1436213764,"creation_date":1409786206,"answer_count":4,"title":"Why can't you just take a vitamin?

E.g., life quality, height, mental disabilities, cardiovascular risks etc. Thing is that for most health problems that stem from single gene variation we already know named gene, or can easily find it out.<\/p>\n\n<p>More complex issues are often hidden in statistics, links are not so clear. So, for example, autism is described by genetic variations (so far) only in less than 30% of cases or so. In other cases there is no genetic predisposition or strong evidence. Mainly that is so because many genes interact to produce final trait or illness. Looking with microscope one gene at a time will not provide information about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should look into multi-gene traits, maybe pick your favourite illness (e.g. autism) and see how it is hereditary (tip: not fully). Whole-genome sequencing is important tool in tracing such issues because it gives wide overview and <em>a lot<\/em> of genetic information about patient.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35811,"question_id":35810,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35810/critical-discussion-gene-expression-and-systems-biology-allows-us-to-understand","last_activity_date":1436178328,"creation_date":1436176240,"answer_count":1,"title":"Critical discussion: Gene expression and systems biology allows us to understand the control of complex traits","body":"<p>I'm having a bit of trouble tackling this question.
