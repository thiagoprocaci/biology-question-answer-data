The anterior part of the choroid continues anteriorly to became a ciliary body which in turn contains ciliary muscle - one circular muscle per eye. From the ciliary body/muscle spread zonules (zonule fibers) and they are fixed on the lens equator. <\/p>\n\n<p>Physiology: contraction of <strong>ciliary muscle<\/strong> causes <strong>zonules<\/strong> to became loosen and <strong>\"free\" the lens<\/strong> to became more convex and move the focus anteriorly (<em>not choroid contracts itself<\/em>). If the ciliary muscle relaxes then zonules are tighten up and the lens consequently becomes more flat (less convex) moving the focus posteriorly. In other words you can say it in the terms of depth of focus - convex lens gives less depth, less convex gives more depth of focus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the classical choroid layer does not perform any action (look at your choroid related link - there are almost nothing about accommodation).<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Permanent state of contraction\" can be physiological (=normal) as well as abnormal one, and it is very common in some conditions (muscles spasms). One example is priapism, where corporal smooth muscle contraction causes permanent and dangerous penile erection which can be medical emergency (priapism is by far more complex, so take the explanation like a metaphor). <\/p>\n\n<p>If we refer to \"accommodation spasm\" there is analogy to \"muscle spasm\" (and partially to priapism), but I should state we believe that spasm of ciliary muscle exists - since we don't see it directly. Probably (and take this sentence as speculation, since I cannot give you reference right now) the causes of this is not a muscle spasm itself, but the state of zonular fibers which cannot come back to their base state. I like the example with iron rod - if you will contract it fast and many times, at some point it can be \"loosen\" as well as fractured (and probably it does happens to zonules too). Probably (I say \"probably\" to underline the point we do not exactly know this), the \"accommodation spasm\" is partially misname and in future the investigations will clarify that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Probably, you will learn some interesting facts from definition of \"pseudoexfoliation\" syndrome, but I do not explain it here because it is not related directly to the question. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoexfoliation_syndrome\">wiki<\/a> \"has been known to cause a weakening of structures within the eye which help hold the eye's lens in place, called lens zonules\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Another example for analogy for continued \"spasm\" is the situation when one should care something heavy for a long distance without releasing the grasp - finally one can get not only spastic contraction but also severe ischemic damage to the fingers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Considering your case, you should know about pathological (degenerative) myopia where the eye expands posteriorly and consequently the focus is before the retina which should be corrected by minus lenses. It is well known fact that myopic eyes have longer axial length then normal eyes. Probably, it is your case.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, the answer to your question is not a clear cut, but assumption. The ciliary muscle does can relax, but probably the problem is more complex then only ciliary muscle related issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>PS The image you reposted is a little bitconfusing one and is not exact.

I consulted an ophthalmologist to see if this was eye strain because I work at computers a lot, or part of a natural degradation of the eye over time, or both. My ophthalmologist seems to believe that in my case I'm youngish enough that the natural degradation with age is minimal, and that it's mostly eye strain that is my problem. She believes I can get my eyesight back to roughly 90% of my post-surgery sight ability, if I can reduce eye strain. She gave me some eye drops to help with dryness, and recommended various ways to for me to help my eyes recuperate.<\/p>\n\n<p>I decided to look into eye strain to learn more about what conditions cause it and what can alleviate it. What I learned is that the lens of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_of_the_eye#Theories_of_mechanism\" rel=\"nofollow\">the eye needs to be flatter to accommodate focusing on far objects<\/a>, and rounded to focus on near objects. The way the lens becomes flat is by using spring-like connective tissue called <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid\" rel=\"nofollow\">choroids<\/a><\/em> that pull it taught. Attached to these choroids are muscles called <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_muscle\" rel=\"nofollow\">ciliary muscles<\/a><\/em> that stretch the choroids out when they contract. This action causes the choroids to stop pulling on the lens, and the lens will retract into a more rounded shape. So, when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, you can see far. When the ciliary muscles are contracted, you can see close up. <a href=\"http://www.yorku.ca/eye/ciliary.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This diagram from the York University website<\/a> was the clearest explanation I have come across:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tM4cr.gif\" alt=\"ciliary muscles and choroids\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the reason for my current inability to focus on far objects is that so much focusing on close objects, mainly computer monitors, is straining my eyes. In order to regain the ability to focus on far objects, I need to reduce strain and allow the muscles to relax. If they relax, the choroids can pull the eye to the flatter shape needed to see far.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I can't reconcile that model with how I understand the mechanics of the other muscles in my body. If I go to the gym and run or lift weights, or in any way expose my muscles to work, they respond by getting stronger without sacrificing the ability to stop contracting. The muscles in my body don't lose the ability to relax, no matter how much I train them. I have never heard of anyone who worked out too hard or too long such that their bicep would remain in a permanent state of contraction.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, in my experience, after a hard workout, it's <em>impossible<\/em> to prevent my muscles from relaxing and resisting doing more work. When I do a bicep curl at the gym, and I do it to the point that I can't lift the weight anymore, my muscle gives up and I drop the weight. Similarly, if I've spent a long time looking at close up objects, shouldn't my ciliary muscles give up, allowing the choroids to take over, making clear far vision the unavoidable outcome?<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea that my ciliary muscles need to relax in order to see far also seems to contradict my personal anecdotal experience. Sometimes I am able to see far away, but I can't hold it for more than a few seconds. If I try to maintain focus on far objects for too long, I get an uncomfortable feeling in my eyes that is hard to describe, but it's a form of pain that forces me to give up. My vision goes blurry, and I can only see close objects again. If my bicep worked the same way, it would be as if it hurt to let my arm hang straight down with a weight, and the only way to alleviate it would be to raise the weight, which makes no sense. I feel like the effort is in seeing far, and that when I'm tired, I can only see close up.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's not that the case that I think that all medical research on the eye has it backwards, it must be that there is some aspect of this that I am not seeing (pun intended).<\/p>\n\n<p>How can it be that the ciliary muscles, unlike other muscles, lose their ability to relax?<\/p>\n\n<p>Why is it that my ciliary muscles don't become exhausted and allow the choroids to take over by default?<\/p>\n","question_id":15736,"tags":["human-biology","eyes"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":15902,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":6975,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1395042502},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1LBbl.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19754,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19754/jean-paul","reputation":91,"display_name":"Jean-Paul","accept_rate":100},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":40145,"edited":false,"creation_date":1446377353,"comment_id":67416,"body":"The adult human brain contains ~86 billion neurons with trillions of synapses <a href=\"http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43512\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated at 0.15 quadrillion<\/a>.

Humans became bipedal in Africa, since bipedality is well-established for the first species in the human lineage to leave Africa (Homo erectus/Homo ergaster).  This can be verified in many textbooks.  However if you ask the question when, in what species, or why, there's no easy answer to your question. The question comes down to (a) which fossils are specifically ancestral to humans (b) what fossils have evidence for bipedality, and (c) theories as to why those species became bipedal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The narrow sense of humans, Homo sapiens, has been bipedal ancestrally.  Other closely related species were almost certainly bipedal (Homo neanderthalensis and Homo heidelbergensis for example).  In fact, the species or species complex from which humans likely arose, Homo erectus, was also likely bipedal (discussion below).  If we take the broadest sense of what \"human\" means, it could mean any species which split from the human lineage after the split with the extant great apes (specifically, post split with chimpanzees).  Here there's reasonable evidence for bipedality exists around the same time as this split, but not in all species.  Specifically, Orrorin tugenensis is a 6 million year old specimen with some (but not conclusive) evidence for bipedalism.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Question b, how do we know a fossil creature is bipedal, is a challenging question.  Homo sapiens, the only completely bipedal primate, have many adaptations which facilitate walking on two legs.  The shape of our pelvis facilitates the muscle attachments necessary for walking by flaring the ilium (the bone which forms the upper part of the pelvis).  This same flaring is found in Australopithecus afarensis (which includes the famous \"Lucy\" specimen), about 3 million years ago.  Australopithecus also has a fossil of footprints, which seems to indicate bipedal movement.  The human femur is bent inwards and the neck is thickened to support the weight of someone walking upright.  This same thickening is found in Orroin tugenensis and the angle in Homo erectus/Homo ergaster (these are two names which are either closely related species or the same species, depending on who you ask). The human big toe is also in line with the others in the foot, which likely allows us better motion on the ground.  This feature is also true of Ardipithecus ramidus, at about 4.5 million years ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>The third part of your question, why humans became bipedal, is largely speculative.  Many theories exist for the process which lead to bipedalism.  A popular theory in the 1970s and 1980s was that humans became bipedal to enhance our abilities to see across tall grass, because many people thought Homo erectus/Homo ergaster was the first upright walking species, and grasslands dominated east Africa at the time.  However since earlier evidence for bipedality, many people have abandoned this hypothesis in favor of others.  These other hypotheses include that bipedalism arose after scaffolding on to arboreal (tree-living) adaptations.  If human ancestors lived in trees, they may have moved in a vertical posture, leading to many of the adaptations needed to move vertically on the ground.  Others include an increased reliance on meat, caught through endurance hunting, or even wading into tidal waters being the key feature (notably this is not the aquatic ape hypothesis, which is pseudoscience), and this reliance on key marine resources provided the essential stable food supply for brain enlargement.  The short answer is that there's a tremendous amount of speculation in this area, and few firm facts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whichever of these species you choose as the \"first bipedal human,\" and how confident you want to be about that bipedality, they all evolved in Africa.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40115,"question_id":40049,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40049/when-did-human-ancestors-learn-to-walk","last_activity_date":1446245598,"creation_date":1446106864,"answer_count":2,"title":"When did human ancestors learn to walk?","body":"<p>Where does our ancestor learn to walk from?

This means a deleterious mutation which has an effect in early life, will affect reproductive value more than a mutation which manifests itself in later life, after the individual has already had offspring. Thus selection will act strongly on genes which are expressed in early life than on those which are expressed later. For that reason, there's no strong selection against diseases such as diabetes or cancer. This argument can be applied not only to occurrence of disease but also to decay of ordinary functions of the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, cells in the body are constantly renewed and defects such as telomeric breaks are repaired.

It&#39;s long enough! ;)"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1423092988,"creation_date":1423092988,"body":"<p>Dizziness after eating, which can lead to falls and passing out, is called <em>postprandial hypotension<\/em>, and as the heart is indeed responsible for responding to hypotension by increasing it's rate - which can be seen in any number of clinical scenarios from blood loss to standing up too suddenly - failure to do so, for any reason including heart disease, can result in continued hypotension, which is experienced by most of us as dizziness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Postprandial hypotension (PhTN) is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 20 mmHg occurring within 2 hours of a meal. This hypotension (hTN) can result not only in dizziness, but  may also cause syncope, falls, weakness, angina pectoris, and stroke. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because PhTN is particularly common in older hypertensive patients, and older patients tend to have higher incidences of heart disease, it was initially thought heart disease was the cause. However, that didn't explain why some young people without heart disease have PhTN.<\/p>\n\n<p>In truth, the mechanism of PhTN is not fully understood. <\/p>\n\n<p>Normally after a meal, blood supply to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract increases, starting with increased flow through the left gastric and celiac arteries, followed by the mesenteric artery, which is more prolonged. Observations indicate that the postprandial hyperemia progresses along the GI tract in association with the movement of ingested food. The magnitude (25\u2013200%) and the duration (3\u20137 h) of the hyperemia appear to depend somewhat on the composition of the meal. The increase in GI blood flow means there's less blood to circulate in the rest of the body (relative hTN). Normally this is corrected for in various ways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Baroreceptors (nerve cells within arteries near the heart and in the kidney) are sensitive to rises, falls, and the rates of change in BP, but are especially sensitive to sudden falls in BP, which results in decreased baroreceptor firing. Autonomic Nervous System responds by increasing sympathetic outflow and decreasing parasympathetic (vagal) outflow. Sympathetic outflow leads to vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance, or SVR), increased HR (tachycardia) and increased force of contraction on the heart (positive inotropy). This leads to a partial restoration of arterial pressure. In people with PhTN, any abnormality at any point in the system will result in an insufficient rise in SBP to overcome the fall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore possible contributors to PhTN include inadequate sympathetic nervous system compensation for meal-induced GI blood pooling; impairments in baroreflex function; inadequate postprandial increases in cardiac output; impaired peripheral vasoconstriction, as well as abnormal responses to GI hormones released during digestion.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dysautonomic patients with postprandial hypotension fail to maintain systemic vascular resistance after a meal. This impairment in vascular response to meal ingestion may underlie the development of PhTN. Power spectral analysis suggests an impairment in the postprandial autonomic modulation of HR in healthy elderly and dysautonomic subjects, possibly predisposing to hTN when vascular compensation is inadequate. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Heart conditions that might result in an inadequate response to PhTN include low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems (decreases cardiac output), heart failure (decreased ejection fraction equals cardiac output), patients with atrial fibrillation (decreases cardiac output because of inadequate filling of ventricles), heart attack (decreased ejection fraction), heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), severe left ventricular hypertrophy, people with HTN on medications which cause a lowered heart rate, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Postprandial Hypotension is an important hemodynamic abnormality in patients with cardiac diseases as well as autonomic nervous system abnormalities such as can be seen in Parkinson's Disease, diabetes mellitus, and others.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=708429\">Postprandial Hypotension: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Clinical Management<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/9288010\">Association of postprandial hypotension with incidence of falls, syncope, coronary events, stroke, and total mortality at 29-month follow-up in 499 older nursing home residents.<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/18/5/694.short\">Postprandial hypotension.

In practice there are resistance mechanisms that operate on whole classes of antibiotics at once(<a href=\"http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/1/20.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">drug exporters<\/a>, for instance). So there might be a bacterium that happens to be actively or passively resistant to every antibiotic on the planet, but it's a question of statistics. I think it's pretty unlikely but there are a lot of bacteria, so it's theoretically possible.

The reason for this limit is the exclusion size of the bacterial porin channels which allows the uptake of the peptides and free amino acids (see reference 2 for details).<\/p>\n\n<p>Once these are exhausted, the growth stops, which is the reason why LB Medium is actually not very good suited to get really high densities (that's why SOC media are used for some applications).

Regarding the concentration I haven't found any data, but in reference 4 it is estimated that only about 25% can be used by the bacteria. Since the mixture contains about 15 grams of protein lysate, this would roughly mean about 4 grams of free amino acids or more.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC386127/?page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Studies on Lysogenesis I.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/243/23/6291.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Size Restriction on Peptide Utilization in Escherichia coli<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jb.asm.org/content/189/23/8746.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Escherichia coli Physiology in Luria-Bertani Broth<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2009/11/the-limitations-of-lb-medium.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Limitations of LB Medium<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":40088,"question_id":40060,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1446214515}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40060/is-it-possible-to-grow-e-coli-k12-with-algal-amino-acids-as-the-sole-carbon-sou","last_activity_date":1446214515,"creation_date":1446133510,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is it possible to grow E. coli K12 with algal amino acids as the sole carbon source?","body":"<p>Instead of glucose or glycerol, is it possible for E coli to grow on an amino acid mixture as the sole carbon source and, if so, what should the concentration be? <\/p>\n","question_id":40060,"tags":["cell-culture","amino-acids","ecoli"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XAjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5963,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5963/harshal-gajjar","reputation":118,"display_name":"Harshal Gajjar"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":15585,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394322966,"comment_id":20957,"body":"A selection of related questions: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7401/what-makes-a-gene-dominant-or-recessive\">what makes a gene dominant or recessive<\/a>, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1294/why-some-genes-are-dominant-to-each-other-what-is-the-mechanism-behind-it/1325#1325\">why are some genes dominant to each other?<\/a> and <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2653/relative-property-of-alleles\">relative properties of alleles<\/a>."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79614cc5fcd376b95171a5c8f6354e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5754,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5754/jarlemag","reputation":3075,"display_name":"jarlemag"},"score":10,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XAjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5963,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5963/harshal-gajjar","reputation":118,"display_name":"Harshal Gajjar"},"score":0,"post_id":15586,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394296968,"comment_id":20944,"body":"Yeah, I used wrong term gene over here.

Firstly, let's get the terminology straightened out: The terms recessive and dominant are not actually used to describe genes, but rather <em>alleles<\/em>. The term allele is used for alternative forms of the same gene.(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>) Many genes have two or more alleles, and <em>some<\/em> genes have alleles that can be described as dominant or recessive.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also useful to be familiar with the terms <em>genotype<\/em> and <em>phenotype<\/em>. Genotype refers to the form of the genetic material (DNA), while phenotype refers to the observed <em>effect<\/em> of the genotype. <\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it's important to realize that the concept of \"dominant\" and \"recessive\" is a human-made <em>abstraction<\/em>. The concept of dominant and recessive genes were invented (or discovered, if you like) before we reached a good undertanding of how genetics works at the molecular level. Thus, genetics in the early days had a much cruder understanding of how different phenotypes depend on the genotype. <\/p>\n\n<p>The dominant/recessive concept is useful in cases where there is a limited number of possible allele pairs and one or several alleles can <em>mask<\/em> the effect of other alleles. This is a very limited set of cases. Many genes have <em>many<\/em> different alleles, and it's hard to account for all of them. Many alleles also do not have a clear observable effect, in which case any \"masking\" effect is not prominent. To quote Wikipedia (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most common basis of dominance and recessiveness is that the\n  dominant allele codes for a functional protein and the recessive\n  allele for a mutant, non-functional protein.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A further important point is made in the following passage:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dominance is not inherent to an allele. It is a relationship between\n  alleles; one allele can be dominant over a second allele, recessive to\n  a third allele, and codominant to a fourth. Dominance should be\n  distinguished from epistasis, a relationship in which an allele of one\n  gene affects the expression of an allele at a different gene.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's consider your example: A single gene with two different <em>alleles<\/em>, T and t. Let's assume the T allele codes for a more powerful version of the growth hormone than the t allele, or that the t allele produces a non-functional hormone. Furthermore, we assume that production of the T hormone from a single allele is enough to make the plant grow tall, and that production of T <em>or t<\/em> from a second allele has no further effect. Then, we can say that the T allele masks the effect of the t allele. However, as you can probably imagine, one allele fully masking the effect of another is rather rare. So recessive/dominant allele pairs are rather the exception than the norm.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the that place for the two <em>alleles<\/em> in the genome of the plant is definitely not empty. Note that a mutation <em>could<\/em> in principle cause one of the genes to be deleted in its entirety from one of the chromosomes of the plant during reproduction. The \"place\" for the <em>gene<\/em> on that chromosome would then indeed be empty. This has nothing to do with how dominance and recessiveness usually works, except that a recessive gene could become expressed if the dominant allele is deleted.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>at the molecular level there is no concept of recessive or dominant alleles. Some genes have allele pairs that can be described as dominant/recessive in relation to each other, most others do not.<\/strong> The <em>effect<\/em> of different combinations of alleles determines whether the relationship between the alleles is described in terms of dominant/recessive.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15586,"question_id":15585,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1394347524},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1394300203,"creation_date":1394300203,"body":"<p>I'm having real difficulty understanding the original question.

But it might be more correct to say we get 1/4 of our total DNA from each of our grandparents, because though the genes are really important to code for specific proteins, there are tons of non-coding DNA in between them. In fact, 98% of our genome is non-coding! Although we are discovering awesome novel functions for this DNA slowly but surely. But it is important to think of it as 1/4 of your DNA and not genes because it is in this non-coding DNA where a lot of mutations can occur, and these mutations are what we inherit and make things like DNA fingerprinting for forensic analysis possible, like in CSI. <\/p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to add three more thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<p>Though it is true that 1/4 of your DNA would come from each grandparent, that is only true for your autosomal genes, not your necessarily for your sex chromosomes. The X chromosome does recombine regularly in the mother, but in the father the X and the Y do not recombine. (Actually I think part of the Y can recombine, but for the most part, the sex-determining part of the Y and its associated genes stay completely intact). This means that if you are a male, your father, and his father, and his father all share the same Y chromosome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally for the women, because the woman makes the egg, and thus all the early embryonic organelles and RNA's, the woman donates the mitochondrial DNA, which has its own sets of genes that are really important and have been linked to many diseases. So every child of a woman, shares their mother's mitochondrial DNA, as she shares her mother's and her mother's mother, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>If ~1/4 of our DNA comes each grandparent, then 1/8 of your DNA comes from each great-grandparent. So then 1/16 of our DNA comes from each great-great grandparent, which are your grandparent's grandparents. And thus it continues exponentially upward. The result is that there comes a point where your ancestors have contributed so little to your actual DNA, that it becomes almost negligible. So if you are an American, who most likely has ancestors from all over the world, even if you have 1 great-great-great-great grandparent who was a French immigrant while the rest of your ancestors were all British, the French DNA is only 1/64 of your total DNA. So even if you are a complete mix, there comes a point where so many different people have contributed to you being you, that you can establish a cut-off and just say, 3/4 of my ancestors were born in America, I'm American!<\/p>\n","answer_id":3348,"question_id":2684,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8f52a4feb50530e2cbaef33d833d4cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1656,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1656/kt8","reputation":76,"display_name":"KT8"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1352815070,"creation_date":1352815070,"body":"<p>There is a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting where the allele of the gene would only get expressed if it is passed on from the father (e.g. IGF2).

Basically, they comprise two aromatic rings that are connected via an oxygen atom. Optionally, they may contain organic side chains and inorganic iodine atoms.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of iodothyronines, which are represented e.g. by the well-known thyroid hormones T4, T3 and 3,5-T2, the side chain contains an amino group and a carboxylate group. Therefore, iodothyronines are amino acids. Up to four different hydrogen atoms (two at every ring) may be replaced by iodine atoms, and the resulting pattern of iodination determines their biological activity. Generally, iodination of the inner ring and deiodination of the outer ring results in high biological activity (e.g. in T3 and 3,5-T2), whereas iodination of the outer ring and deiodination of the inner ring delivers a receptor-blocking thyroid hormone (e.g. reverse-T3). There are three deiodinases encoded by the DIO1, DIO2 and DIO3 genes that catalyze the \"step-up\" and \"step-down\" reactions to active or inactive thyroid hormones, respectively. Multiple molecular processes are able to differentially upregulate and downregulate tissue deiodinases. Therefore, thyroid hormones are subject to both global and local control.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4VCWE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Removal of the amino group results in iodothyroacetates. Their biological effects are similar to those of iodothyronines, but in addition to nuclear receptors they also have a strong effect on membrane-bound receptors, which are only weakly activated by iodothyronines.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yeW9w.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Thyronamines lack the carboxylate group. Their biological effect is different to that of iodothyronines and iodothyroacetates. By activating the membrane-bound TAAR1 receptor they have an effect that is in most respects antagonistic to that of classical thyroid hormones. Thyronamines seem to be most active in deiodinated state.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3XZDB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Summarizing, both organic and anorganic modifications are able to modulate the effect of thyroid hormones.

They affect every part of the body, and are important for cell-cell signaling. Wikipedia says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The thyronines act on nearly every cell in the body. They act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we have iodine in these hormones?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is really what your question is. I have found several articles about this and what I found is Iodine is an important catalyst, and Iodotryosines evolved to be important hormones<\/p>\n\n<p>First, of all, the use of iodine in organisms was ancient. Many prokaryotes and protists used it as a way to deal with reactive oxygen species. Iodide peroxidases were present in primitive oxygenic and photosynthetic Cyanobacteria about 3 - billion years ago. This is because Iodine is one of the most ancient antioxidants. <\/p>\n\n<p>The thyroxine-like hormones seems to have evolved some 4 Mya in unicellular algae. However, its original function was not for cell-cell signaling as is the case for T3 and T4. It was originally to catalyze other biochemical reactions and scavaging  free radicals. This all came about when tyrosine was first created. Iodine reacts with the tyrosine, and forms iodotryosines that were important catalysts for many biochemical reactions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The first use of Iodotryosines for regulation could have been for ATPase in the mitochondria for non-verterbrate organisms. Also, for vertebrates, the regulation of mtRNA was regulated by iodotryosines.<\/p>\n\n<p>Iodotyrosines can diffuse between cells very easily, and the development of TH-receptors leaded to the development of thyroxine hormones. Such hormones were used first for embryological development, metamorphosis (if this is the correct term) of amphibians, and more. The rest is really evolution! These hormones are present in virtually all organisms (except prokaryotes).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, the use of iodine in hormones started with iodine in the first cells as they provide protection against free radicals and reactive oxygen species, while catalyzing biochemical reactions. Iodotyrosines evolved to be important for regulation in cells and finally important in cell-cell signaling.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have any more questions, please ask in the comments or we can chat in the Biosphere.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>These are my sources and there is much more information on these articles.

There are slight exceptions though of lineages that have lost their legs. Typically snakes have no legs anymore. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7087/abs/nature04413.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apesteguia and Zaher (2006)<\/a> discuss the evolution of snakes legs reduction and report a fossil of snakes with a robust sacrum.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cetaecea (whales and friends)<\/a> have lost their hind legs but we can still spot them on the skeleton. See for example the orca (killer whale, easily recognizable to its teeths) on the picture below. Pay attention to the small bones below its vertebral column at the level on the left side of the picture. I also want to draw attention to the importance of the definition of legs. I guess that we would call something a pair of legs if it is constructed using a similar developmental pathway than current existing legs. If we are using some broader definition, then a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensile_tail\" rel=\"nofollow\">prehsenile tail<\/a> as found in some new world monkeys for example might be somehow considered as a leg (but only a single leg, not a pair of legs obviously). A list of animals having a prehensile tail can be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensile_tail#Animals_with_fully_prehensile_tails\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> (wikipedia).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you say Natural Selection?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think (might be wrong) that you have too selectionist a view of evolution. What I mean is that you are wondering why mammals have four legs and you're looking for an explanation of the kind \"because mammal have this kind of need of locomotion and for this purpose four is the most optimal number of legs\". Consider the following sentence: \"If there is a need, natural selection will find a way!\". This sentence is wrong! Evolution is not that easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reality is that it is not easy to evolve such a developmental pathway as drastic as having an extra pair of legs that is well integrated into the body of the carrier of this new trait. Such individual would need a brain, a nerve code, a heart and some other features that are adapted to have extra legs. Also, assuming such a thing came to existence it is rather complicated to imagine how it could be selected for. To go slightly further, you have to realize that there are many stochastic processes in evolution (including mutation and random variation in reproductive success) and an organism is a complex machinery and is not necessarily easily transformable to some other form that would be more efficient (have higher reproductive success). Often going from one form to another may involves a \"valley crossing\" meaning that if several mutations are needed, intermediate forms may have low reproductive success and therefore a high amount of genetic drift (stochasticity in reproductive success) to cross such valley of low reproductive success. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_balance_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">shifting balance theory<\/a>. A complete discussion on why the sentence \"If there is a need, natural selection will find a way!\" is wrong would fill up a whole book.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why 4 legs?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So basically, terrestrial vertebrates have four legs because they evolved from a fish ancestor that had four members that were possibly used as legs (that could \"easily\" evolve into legs). The explanation is as simple and basic as that. You can have a look to the diversity of terrestrial vertebrates <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Terrestrial_Vertebrates/14952\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> (click on the branches).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Number of legs in invertebrates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Arthropda (Spiders (and other chelicerata), insects (and other hexapods), crustaceans (crabs, shrimps\u2026) and Myriapoda (millipedes) and Trilobite as well)) evolved from a common ancestor who had a highly segmented body. From this ancestor many group have fused some segments. In these taxa, each pair of legs is attached to a particular segment (I don't think the segments are still visible in spiders today). In insects for example, all 6 legs are attached to the thorax but to 3 different segments of the thorax, the pro- meso and meta- thorax (see below).<\/p>\n\n<p>As a sidenote, it is interesting to know that the wings in insects did not evolve from the legs (as it is the case in birds and bats). There are two competing hypotheses for the origin of insect wings. Wings either developed from gills or from sclerite (chitine plate, the hard part of the insect). At the time an insect population evolved wings, it actually evolved three pairs of wings (one on each segment of the thorax). One pair has then been lost. In the diptera a second pair of wings has been lost and are replaced by halteres, particularly easy to spot in craneflies (see below picture).

We are far from having enough knowledge in protein biophysics (and many other fields)  to answer that question. There are so many parameters to take into account. I would expect that creating a third pair of legs would need major changes and therefore one mutation will never be enough in order to develop a third pair of legs. But, no I cannot cite you any reference for this, I am just guessing!<\/p>\n\n<p>Following the wings example in insects. Insects have had three pairs of wings. While some mutation prevented the expression of the third (the first actually) pair many of the genetic information for this third pair remain in the genotype of insects as they still use it for the two other pairs. Taking advantage of that, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehopper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Membracidae (treehoppers)<\/a> developed some features using similar biochemical pathway than the one use to develop wings. Those structures are used as protection or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry\" rel=\"nofollow\">batesian mimicry<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Let's imagine that an extremely unlikely series of mutations occur that create some rodent with 6-legs. Let's imagine this rodent with six legs has a larger heart in order to pump blood to these extra legs and it has a brain that is adapted to using six legs and some changes in its nerve cord so that it can control its 3rd pair of legs. Will this rodent have higher reproductive success than other individuals in the population? Well\u2026 let's imagine that with its six legs, it can run faster or whatever and has a very high fitness. How would the offspring of a six-leg mother (or father) and a four-leg father (or mother) look like? Will it be able to reproduce? See the issue is that it is hard for such trait to come to existence because 1) it needs many steps (mutations) and 2) it is hard to imagine how it could be selected for. For those reasons, there exist no vertebrates with 6 fully functional legs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, let's assume it does and in consequence after 200 generations or so, the whole population is only made of 6-leg individuals. Maybe the species got extinct then and no fossil record has ever been found. This is possible. It is not because something has existed that we necessarily find something in the fossil record.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21776,"question_id":21772,"up_vote_count":51,"last_edit_date":1446077621},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7caed18bfdbfecbba86f636749c8f029?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9575,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9575/fluffysheap","reputation":219,"display_name":"fluffysheap"},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"post_id":21782,"edited":false,"creation_date":1412145183,"comment_id":34470,"body":"needs references"}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1412144413,"creation_date":1412144413,"body":"<p>I think I might interpret your question as asking, not just why don't mammals have more than four limbs, but why arthropods have more variety.  Insects have six, but others have eight, ten, or more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Partly there are just many more species of arthropods.  80% of animal species are some sort of arthropod, and some lineages of arthropods are distantly related to each other because arthropods as a group have existed since the Cambrian period.  With so many more species, it's no surprise that they've managed to tack on some extra variety.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although it might seem that insects and spiders are more closely related than, say, humans and fish, the reverse is actually true.  In fact, insects split off from other arthropods at approximately the same time that fish were diversifying into the three main lineages that would eventually become cartilaginous fish (sharks &amp; rays), ray-finned (\"regular\") fish, and lobe-finned fish (coelacanths and lungfish).  All of these things happened at approximately the same time, geologically speaking, at around 400 million years ago.  Some ancient lungfish crawled up onto land a short while after, giving rise to land animals.  So in light of this, it's not really surprising that arthropods would have so much diversity in body plan - you don't look much like a leafy sea dragon (I hope).<\/p>\n\n<p>But perhaps another way of looking at it is in the difficulty involved in adapting the body plans of these different types of animals.  Arthropods have segmented bodies.  In some arthropods, especially the myriapoda (centipedes, millipedes and so on), there's a pretty straightforward arrangement of one segment to one pair of legs (excluding the head).  Vertebrates have a segmented body plan too, but our segments aren't quite so well-separated.  In vertebrates, a \"segment\" is approximately equal to one vertebra.  So since vertebrates aren't in the habit of attaching a pair of legs to each vertebra, it's harder to grow more legs.  Instead, vertebrates have internal skeletons, with the familiar hips and shoulders in land animals.  Vertebrates do have good luck adapting the internal structure when they need to.  Most use the traditional four-leg layout, but humans, birds, whales, and snakes have all made pretty significant changes to it.  But internally, it's still the familiar hips and shoulders - even snakes still have the necessary bones.  Given another few hundred million years, they might disappear entirely, but it seems like the basic bone structure is tough to change.  Who knows, in a hundred million years, the far future descendants of snakes might end up with legs again, and grow six or eight instead of four!<\/p>\n\n<p>So, overall, I'd say that the two main reasons are that the arthropod body plan is just a little more flexible due to its higher degree of modularity, and that different kinds of arthropods are actually more distantly related than you might expect.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21782,"question_id":21772,"up_vote_count":12},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbe6a0909e3e3704092210b2f3264dd7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9583,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9583/abulafia","reputation":120,"display_name":"Abulafia"},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1412171986,"creation_date":1412171986,"body":"<p>The answer by Remi.B is excellent, I'll just attempt an explanation by way of gene networks:<\/p>\n\n<p>In genetics we see new genes \"linking\" to the older genome by regulation pathways and by being \"fit\" only in the context of the existing genome. This has the effect of making the older genes indispensable. Change them and you rupture the whole mesh.

Connective tissue is tissue that connects, supports, binds, or separates other tissues or organs. In the connective tissue, there are cells known fibroblasts. According to an article in The Scientist (<a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35301/title/The-Science-of-Stretch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35301/title/The-Science-of-Stretch/<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the cells that are responsible for synthesizing all the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix. These cells reside within the matrix they create, responding to mechanical stimulation by regulating the amount of collagen and other matrix proteins produced, and by secreting matrix-degrading enzymes in response to chronic changes in tissue forces.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Their research also showed that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the fibroblasts initiated a specific Rho-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization that was required for the tissue to fully relax. Rho is an intracellular signaling molecule known to play a role in cell motility and the remodeling of cell-surface proteins that connect the fibroblast to its surrounding matrix. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They also mentioned that the fibroblasts secrete ATP, which is converted to adenosine which is an analgesic. This leads me to a second article in in Discover Magazine (<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/30/a-biological-basis-for-acupuncture-or-more-evidence-for-a-placebo-effect/#.VjAmFyPn_qD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/30/a-biological-basis-for-acupuncture-or-more-evidence-for-a-placebo-effect/#.VjAmFyPn_qD<\/a>). In this article, they mention about a paper that described the importance of adenosine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Criticism<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The research showed that the A1 receptor for adenosine is important for acupuncture to work. But they mention in the Discover article that there is nothing special about acupuncture. They say:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>o answer that, clinical trials have used sophisticated methods, including \u201csham needles\u201d, where the needle\u2019s point retracts back into the shaft like the blade of a movie knife. It never breaks the skin, but patients can\u2019t tell the difference from a real, penetrating needle. Last year, one such trial (which was widely misreported) found that acupuncture does help to relieve chronic back pain and outperformed \u201cusual care\u201d. However, it didn\u2019t matter whether the needles actually pierce the skin, because sham needles were just as effective. Nor did it matter where the needles were placed, contrary to what acupuncturists would have us believe.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is hard to also have a control but it seems the best may be the sham needles. However, much of this research is debatrd.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope I have answered your question.

The distribution of wavelengths coming from sunlight looks like this (wavelengths on the x axis):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/E22yL.gif\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/E22yL.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Any perceived 'colour' is some sort of summary of the wavelengths of the photons which get into an animal's eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, a little about colour perception<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are cells in the eyes which respond to being hit by photons: these are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell\">rods<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell\">cones<\/a>. Colour vision is principally achieved using the cone cells, which have a peak sensitivity at <em>one particular<\/em> wavelength, and are less sensitive at other wavelengths.<\/p>\n\n<p>We (non-colourblind humans) have three different types of cone cell, sensitive to photons with wavelengths of 560, 530, or 420 nm, corresponding to the peak sensitivities of three different types of light-sensitive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin\">opsins<\/a> which are present in cone cells. Other types of opsin exist in rod cells (Rhodopsin) and our circadian-rhythm entrainment (melanopsin), but the three different opsins in our cone cells are responsible for our colour vision. Because we have three different types of cone cell, we are referred to as 'cone trichromats'. The sensitivities of the three cone types overlap a bit, looking like this when plotted over the visible spectrum:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JQ5nK.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JQ5nK.jpg\" alt=\"image from http://www.illinoislighting.org/graphics/c-cones.jpg\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>When cone trichromats perceive colour, what we're doing is taking the information on how active each of our different types of cone cell are, and using that to infer how many photons there are of each wavelength in the light that hits our eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, cone trichromats can't possibly summarise the whole diversity of wavelengths that are coming into their eyes using just three different measures of intensity - the line is way too complicated to summarise from three points. Also note that for humans, there is no cone cell that is sensitive above about 700 nm, or below about 400 nm. This means that we simply can't see differences in the infra-red or UV parts of the colour spectrum.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does this all relate to colour-blindness in animals?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is fairly simple to test the peak sensitivity of a cone cell: you <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698910003603\">take an eye from a freshly-dead animal, hook up an electrode to a cone cell, and then provide light of different wavelengths, and measure what wavelength causes the cell to 'fire' the most<\/a>. If you repeat this with a large number of different cells, you can confidently determine how many different types of cone cell the animal has, and what wavelengths those cone cells are most sensitive to. This experiment (or similar ones) has been done for many different species, so we have a good background knowledge of what colours different species are capable of seeing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many species have only two types of cone cell (i.e., they are cone <em>di<\/em>-chromats, as against non-colourblind humans, which are cone <em>tri<\/em>-chromats). This doesn't mean they see <em>no<\/em> colour, but it does limit the types of colour they are able to see. Many tools exist to simulate the visual ability of cone dichromats, for instance <a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/2.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also cone <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy\">tetrachromatic<\/a> (four types of cone cell) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentachromacy\">pentachromatic<\/a> (five types) species. The record appears to be held by mantis shrimps, which have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp#Eyes\">sixteen different types of cone cell<\/a>. These species can in principle see a greater diversity of colours than cone trichromats.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Does colourblindness present an evolutionary problem?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Not necessarily. Compared to cone tetrachromatic species, humans are 'colourblind', and it seems to have very little impact on our day-to-day survival. Similarly, most colourblind humans (i.e., with one or more types of cone cell disabled compared to non-colourblind humans) get along perfectly fine - a special test is needed to detect colourblindness in humans. If trichromatic vision gives no particular survival advantage, there is no reason to think that it will be favoured by evolution.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39890,"question_id":39882,"up_vote_count":15,"last_edit_date":1445680407},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1445996337,"creation_date":1445692419,"body":"<p><strong>Short answer<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dichromats can discriminate colors;<\/li>\n<li>Color vision in animals can be tested behaviorally;<\/li>\n<li>Trichromatic vision is not essential for most animals, but is believed to be beneficial to species relying on fruits (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore\" rel=\"nofollow\">frugivores<\/a>). <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nI would like to complement bshane's excellent physiological perspective with a more behaviorally oriented answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, it is quite <strong>incorrect to say that dichromats can't see color<\/strong>. \"Color blindness\" is a deceptive term, since dichromats are not blind to colors, they are \"blind\" to some. For example, the most common type of color blindness, namely red-green color blindness (<a href=\"http://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/\" rel=\"nofollow\">deuteranopia<\/a>), is caused by the lack of green cones. Because of the <a href=\"http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/psych115s/notes/lecture5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">red-green opponency<\/a> in color vision, they have difficulties discerning greens and reds. However, they can see yellow and blues perfectly fine. Hence, 2 cone classes are sufficient to recognize colors, but missing a green cone simply results in reduced resolution in the long wavelengths. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Evolutionary<\/strong>, the added cone in trichromats is the medium-wavelength green cone. Trichromatic vision has evolved relatively late in evolution in New World Monkeys and is thought to have been beneficial to them to distinguish between ripe (red/yellow) and unripe (green) fruits, as their diet consists for an important part of fruits <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/263/1370/593.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Osorio &amp; Vorobyev, 1996)<\/a>. Noteworthy is that trichromatism is more of an exception than a rule. Nocturnal animals are often monochromats, as <a href=\"http://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/vandplite/pages/chap_9/ch9p1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">rod<\/a>-mediated vision is beneficial under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">scotopic<\/a> conditions. Nocturnal species not only are not negatively impacted by a lack of color vision, they in fact benefit from it, because all of their retinal space is occupied by light-sensitive rods. The photon-hungry color-receptive <a href=\"http://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/vandplite/pages/chap_9/ch9p1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cones<\/a> need <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">photopic<\/a> conditions. Dichromats are the rule, while trichromatic vision is considered exceptional.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We can show <strong>trichromatic color vision in animals<\/strong> using behavioral experiments. Animals can be trained to perform color recognition tasks, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_Color_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\">Munsell papers<\/a>, that test the ability of the subject to recognize  red, yellow\u2013red, green\u2013yellow, green, blue\u2013green, blue, purple\u2013blue, purple and red\u2013purple colors. When the subject is able to succesfully recognize these colors, it is safe to say they are trichromats.

This is driven by Tfh cells. The specific cytokine stimulating the class switch determines the isotype of the heavy chain to be synthesized. For your example, interleukin 4 (IL-4) drives the class switch to IgE. You also need a costimulatory signal from the CD40/CD40L interaction between the B cell and the Tfh cell. This induces activation-induced deaminase (AID), see bottom paragraph on this. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are switch regions (denoted S) in the introns between J and C segments at the 5' end of each C<sub>H<\/sub> locus, and upstream of that is an I exon (region denoted I) w/ it's own promoter. Induction by CD40 and whatever cytokine is present starts transcription of the I exon, switch region and C<sub>H<\/sub> chain of the H-chain the B cell is meant to switch to. This <em>germline transcript<\/em> facilitates dsDNA breaks at the switch regions S<sub>µ<\/sub> for the IgM (switch region mu) and the switch region for the class to be switched to, S<sub>ε<\/sub> in our case for IgE.

These nicks lead to dsDNA breakages in the switch regions. Text shows that the switch region DNA is G-C rich and can form stable RNA:DNA hybrids with the coding strand of the switch region and the germline transcript. This is what frees up the noncoding strand for alteration by UNG and cutting by APE. The result is that the V region becomes associated w/ a new constant region.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd also be careful with the terminology plasma cell as used in the title because we aren't yet at the high-affinity secreting stage when we're talking about class switching.

An organism that produces venom is venomous. Poison is <em>not<\/em> venomous, the black mamba <em>is<\/em> venomous. <em>Venom<\/em> is not venomous.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom\" rel=\"nofollow\">venom<\/a>,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Venom is a form of toxin secreted by an animal for the purpose of causing harm to another. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin\" rel=\"nofollow\">toxin<\/a> is a poisonous substance produced by a living organism. The article goes on:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Venom is injected into victims by means of a bite, sting or other sharp body feature, which differentiates it from poison (that is absorbed, consumed or inhaled).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, a toxin is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison\" rel=\"nofollow\">poison<\/a>, and poisons are defined (by wiki) as <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>substances which cause disturbances to organisms, usually by chemical reaction or other activity on the molecular scale, <strong>when a sufficient quantity is absorbed by an organism<\/strong>. (emphasis mine)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the definitions are kind of circular. <\/p>\n\n<p>From what I understand of your question, you are wondering whether a venom would still be dangerous if it were, for example, ingested rather than injected, as well as whether a poison would still be dangerous if injected rather than ingested (or inhaled, or whatever), and this is where the \"Too Broad\" category gets applied. There are thousands if not millions of different types of toxins in the world, ranging from full proteins to peptide-based to small organic molecules to completely different structures, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide\" rel=\"nofollow\">lipopolysaccharide<\/a> (LPS, the component of Gram-negative bacteria that causes septic shock). Some may not survive the digestive tract, others might. Some can act through the skin, others can't be absorbed. Inhalation is the next best thing to injection, but probably not for every single one of them, so it's impossible to make broad statements about their efficacy and median lethal dose via different routes of exposure. The exact same thing applies to the \"poisons\" category - while something that is damaging when absorbed cutaneously, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmercury\" rel=\"nofollow\">methyl mercury<\/a>, is probably just as damaging directly injected into the bloodstream, it's impossible to say that with certainty about <em>all<\/em> poisons.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39978,"question_id":39977,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1445913523,"creation_date":1445913523,"body":"<p>Most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_venom#Chemistry\" rel=\"nofollow\">venoms contain a lot of enzymes<\/a>.

Lastly, a rare form of this event is defined by incomplete penetrance or mosaicism of cells that contain duplication.  Short Answer: No, In rare cases, a carrier can pass on trisomy 21 without being affected themselves but they themselves are a \"balanced carrier\" and don't have extra chromosome 21 material. See last paragraph below from the NIH and this quote from the Mayo Clinic: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material, but no extra genetic material \u2014 this means he or she is a balanced carrier. A balanced carrier has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but he or she can pass the translocation on to children, causing extra genetic material from chromosome 21<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Types of Down Syndrome details from: <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/down/conditioninfo/Pages/causes.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">NIH Down Syndrome Information Page<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Research shows that three types of chromosomal changes can lead to Down syndrome.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Complete trisomy 21. In this case, an error during the formation of the egg or the sperm results in either one having an extra chromosome. So after the egg and sperm unite, the resulting cells will also have three copies of chromosome 21. The complete extra copy of chromosome 21 is in all of the person's cells\u2014or a complete trisomy. Complete trisomy 21 is the cause of about 95% of Down syndrome cases.1,2,3<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Mosaic trisomy 21. Not every cell in the body is exactly the same. In about 1% of Down syndrome cases, most of the cells in the body have the extra chromosome, but some of them don't. This is called \"mosaicism.\" Mosaic trisomy 21 can occur when the error in cell division takes place early in development but after a normal egg and sperm unite. It can also occur early in development when some cells lose an extra chromosome 21 that was present at conception. The symptoms of someone with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary from those of someone with complete trisomy 21 or translocation trisomy 21, depending on how many cells have the extra chromosome.1,2<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Translocation trisomy 21. In this type of chromosomal change, only part of an extra copy of chromosome 21 is in the cells. The extra part of the chromosome gets \"stuck\" to another chromosome and gets transmitted into other cells as the cells divide. This type of change causes about 4% of Down syndrome cases. There are no distinct cognitive or medical differences between people with translocation trisomy 21 and those with complete trisomy 21.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Sometimes, a parent who does not have Down syndrome may carry a translocation in chromosome 21 that can be passed on to children and cause Down syndrome. Studying the parents\u2019 chromosomes can reveal whether this is the cause of the syndrome.

This is achieved first by the soap chemically bonding to certain molecules (i.e. oil or lipids). Second, friction from rubbing mechanically and rinsing with water pick up and removes the soap and chemically bonded particles. Thus, the more soap and the longer the hands are rubbed together, the less oil and microbes left on your hands.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a more scientific answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>Soap is a detergent, meaning one side of the molecule is hydrophilic (likes water), and the other is hydrophobic (likes oil). Cellular membranes are also made out of a dual sided hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecule called a lipid. The soap solvates the hydrophobic parts of the lipid cell membrane, and you're left with a mixture of lipids &amp; oils suspended in the soap. These are washed away when you rinse with water (imagine how cooking oil floats on top of water).<\/p>\n\n<p>For another (longer) response to this question see <a href=\"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2168\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Comments on website credibility:<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll also comment that at any point that you do an online search, you REALLY need to pay attention to the source of the information you're looking at. The internet is crawling with misinformation and inaccuracies -- often represented as fact or even presented by a so-called 'expert'! Typically, .edu websites (from academic institutions) are MUCH MUCH more trustworthy than .com, .org, etc. because they typically originate from some kind of peer-review or life-long study of a topic. <\/p>\n\n<p>Be cautious, however, that you don't end up on a .edu page that contains a student's (or other non expert's) thoughts/opinions/or (possibly wrong) response to a question. Further, unfortunately it's not always this simple, as .org or .com info isn't necessarily wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to increase your odds of finding the most accurate information,  go straight to the peer-reviewed literature (start a search <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>). If this is too daunting a task or if you can't find what you're looking for, then I'd suggest focusing on .edu websites for info. You can use the \"site:\" operator in a Google search to specify a domain -- specifically, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality references, you could use site:.edu to only pull up results from .edu domains.<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, I think it's clear that your first link is not nearly as trustworthy as your second, and in this case can be dismissed as internet misinformation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n","answer_id":39900,"question_id":39894,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1445702986},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XdJ9g.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19432,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19432/akadrhouse","reputation":448,"display_name":"akaDrHouse"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1445780915,"creation_date":1445702349,"body":"<p>Soap is a detergent.

Cells have to fulfill multiple different functions to be able to build complex multicellular organisms. Differently expressed genes lead to different proteins made in the cell, which leads to different morphology, shape or function. For example melanocytes in the skin are highly specialized cells which mostly make the pigment melanin. Plasma cells on the other are highly specialised for making antibodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is all about regulation of genes. The RNA doesn't know or transcribe anything - \nthe DNA is trancribed into the mRNA (which is then further processed) and finally translated into proteins. Cells develop from precursors which proliferate and finally differentiate into highly specific cells. This progress is controlled and activated by specific transcription factors and growth factors. For example: pigment cells only develop, when a specific transcription factor is present. When this factor cannot be expressed, these cells do not develop at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>This developmental process is shown schematically in the figure below (the figure is from the NIH website on <a href=\"http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/pages/chapter1.aspx\">stem cells)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H8qB9.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":15545,"question_id":15544,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1394142810},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1260d8a009d05d8eada4867047e6f6d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":19260,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19260/medical-student","reputation":1,"display_name":"Medical student"},"score":-2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":2,"last_activity_date":1445837182,"creation_date":1444340468,"body":"<p>Despite of the fact that all cells have the same genome, not all the genes contained in the cell nuclei are functional.

For this reason, only a certain number of genes of the total that a differentiated cell contains, are in use.

(Environmental cue --> Cell signal --> Cell turns on or off different genes based on these signals)<\/p>\n\n<p>Recognizing that all cells have the same DNA is a good place to start. Imagine a single celled zygote formed from the union of one sperm and one egg...Early on, each of cell is capable of reacting in the same way to the same signals. And as the early embryo's cells begin proliferating, but before it implants in the womb, each cell is pretty much the same. And each cell has the possibility of becoming any of the myriad of cell types in the body. In fact, you can even split these early embryos apart and generate twins - two bodies (or more) instead of one.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, soon, the embryo comes to rest against the wall of the womb and implant there. From this point on, not every cell gets the same signals. One cell is resting against the wall of the womb, another is several cell-widths away from the wall. A bit of randomness acts as the start of differentiation. The two cells start reacting to the signals in their slightly different environment and progress towards different fates. As development proceeds, these small differences become more pronounced and cells begin to commit to distinct lineages. No longer are they 'pluripotent' and able to become any given cell. The possibilities are more restricted as the environment of each cell gets more and more different. Cells 'commit' to their decisions and can't go back.<\/p>\n\n<p>One good book you can pick up that will walk you through this idea is Neil Shubin's 'Your Inner Fish.'

What you describe here is known as <strong>aposematism<\/strong>. Aposematism is the adapation of warning signals against the predator. This word is used for any sound, coloring, and odor used as a warning signal. Of course, for this question the focus is color.<\/p>\n\n<p><b><h1>Honest indications<\/h1><\/b>\nAnimal coloration is usually an honest indication of their noxiousness. The brighter they are, the more noxious and toxic they are (<a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1658/871\">http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1658/871<\/a>). In the linked article, there are many references one this positive correlation of toxicity of prey to predator and the brightness of the coloration.

Such arrangements in signal structure may increase redundancy in the signal but improve the likelihood that the strategic component will be detected by the receiver. In addition, repeated elements may be rare in many natural environments, thus increasing conspicuousness of the prey animal. Simple pattern components (such as stripes and spots) may facilitate detection and also speed up avoidance learning if they are easier to memorize.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The research seem to show that the patterns, such as the stripes, lead to increased avoidance, but it is not sure whether or not it is due to the stripes itself or due to the constrast of the black and yellow.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope I have answered your question and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39943,"question_id":39935,"up_vote_count":10}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39935/why-black-and-yellow-indicates-danger","last_activity_date":1445819980,"creation_date":1445797702,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why black and yellow indicates danger?","body":"<p>It is a pretty well-known fact that combination of black and yellow indicates danger or poisonousness.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dc400.4shared.com/img/K5q9RrZv/s7/12a0fd36370/Tape_Black_and_yellow_stripe\"><img src=\"http://dc400.4shared.com/img/K5q9RrZv/s7/12a0fd36370/Tape_Black_and_yellow_stripe\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In western society it seems obvious this comes from bees and wasps, but the look to the patterns of venomous tropical frogs led me to think about it different way (it seems like many frogs use yellow and black).

Mom, that must have been an accident.\") But it wasn\u2019t an accident.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is flight, alright: a pure <em>flight of fancy<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There have been many hundreds of videocams set up in all kinds of remote locations so that behavior in the wild can be studied. Some of the most popular cams in recent years have been the eagle cams (e.g. at eagles.org). They are live during nesting season and record for all the behavior of eagles.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the parents did not feed their young, as described in the fabrication above, the young would starve to death, as it takes time to learn to fly. If anything, the eagle parents must increase the feeding to keep up with the nutritional needs of the growing chicks, and the muscle building taking place. The parents don't stop feeding until a while after they're flying well. <\/p>\n\n<p>Eagles don't learn \"learn\" why they have wings by observing the mother eagle hovering above them (pure anthropomorphizing). They leave the nest and start roaming on the branches, practicing hopping, landing, and building up their wing strength. Eventually flying, they still come back to the nest to feed. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxDMtRqYbhc\" rel=\"nofollow\">this video<\/a> from British Columbia (not the most exciting in the world) you can see exactly this happening with bald eagles. Eventually the young eagles scavenge and learn to hunt for themselves. It takes time. <a href=\"http://www.hornbyeagles.com/eaglefaq.htm#E\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page<\/a> describes the fledgling feeding and flight behavior.<\/p>\n\n<p>While I am not going to try to find an eagle that behaves in the bizarre manner you've found and asked about, I will say that eagles are eagles and more or less behave pretty similarly. The most common eagle in the world is the bald eagle. The Golden behaves like the Bald. Eagle behavior is influenced by habitat, etc. Wikipedia has a page listing 60 species of eagles. Picking a random eagle from another part of the world (in this case, the Sub-Saharan <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_eagle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martial eagle<\/a>, this information seems to confirm that attentiveness of adult eagles and fledgling behavior is <em>similar<\/em> though not without species variation:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Martial eagles have a slow breeding rate, laying usually one egg (rarely two) every two years. The egg is incubated for 45 to 53 days and the chick fledged at 96 to 104 days. Despite increasing signs of independence (such as flight and beginning to practice hunting), juvenile birds will remain in the care of their parents for a further 6 to 12 months. Due to this long dependence period, these eagles can usually only mate in alternate years.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm sure I'm not the first to warn you not to believe everything you read on the internet.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26363,"question_id":26361,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1420273940}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26361/what-species-of-eagle-pushes-their-young-to-teach-them-flying","last_activity_date":1445764192,"creation_date":1420262933,"answer_count":1,"title":"What species of eagle pushes their young to teach them flying?","body":"<p>There are many references to eagle pushing their young off the nest to make them know how to fly, for example <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ap8u-xD8xc\">this motivational video<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also described in <a href=\"http://www.eagleflight.org/cyberstudies/actions-and-attitudes-of-a-growing-church/157-with-eagles-wings\">this website<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let me show you \"the ways of an eagle\" in the nest, and give you a picture of our lives as well. After the eaglets get to a certain size, or maturity, everything changes! One day the mother eagle comes back from being gone, but this time there\u2019s no food in her beak, and she doesn\u2019t land on the edge of the nest. Instead, she hovers over the nest.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>You may not know this, but an eagle can do almost what a hummingbird can do. Even though they are great birds, they can remain almost motionless in midair with those great wings just undulating in the breeze. They do this about three feet above the nest. I\u2019m sure if little eagles could talk to one another\u2014and maybe they can\u2014one would certainly say, \"My, what strong wings Mommy has.\"<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Why does the mother do this? She is demonstrating that those curious appendages on the babies\u2019 backs have a useful function. Eagles, of course, were meant to fly, but they don\u2019t know that. If we take an eagle and separate it at birth from its parents, it will never learn to fly. It will just grovel around in the dirt like a chicken. It might even look up and see eagles soaring overhead and never guess that it was meant to soar in the heavens.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Eagles have to be taught, and that\u2019s the mother\u2019s job. So first she just demonstrates.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The next thing she does is come down into the nest and surprise her young. One can imagine how warm it must normally be for the little eagles to snuggle with their mother and be enshrouded with her feathers, but this time she puts her head up against one of the little ones, and pushes that little one closer and closer to the edge of the nest. (\"Hey mom, mom, what are you doing?\")<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>All at once she pushes the little one out of the nest, and the eaglet falls down the face of the cliff, surely to be destroyed. But not so! In a flash the great mother eagle flies down, catches the little one on her back, and flies up and deposits it in the nest. (\"Whew! Mom, that must have been an accident.\") But it wasn\u2019t an accident. The mother bird pushes the little one out again, and again, over and over.<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Why would a mother do that to her young? Does she hates the little one? Not at all. It\u2019s just that those little birds were made to fly, and they don\u2019t know it, so she is going to push them out of the nest. She never lets them hit bottom, but she does let them fall, because they have to learn something they don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The next time the mother bird comes back she decides to clean house, and so she stands on the edge of the nest. The first things to go are the feathers inside; she drops them over the edge. Then the leaves go over the edge\u2014heave ho! While this is going on, she\u2019s not very talkative, either. (\"Mom, what are you doing?\") She pays no attention. Since she built the house, she knows how to take it apart.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Next she decides to take the sticks out of the middle of the nest, and with her great strong beak and feet, she\u2019s able to break them off and stand them straight up. (\"Mom, it\u2019s not comfortable in here anymore.\") Then she takes certain key sticks out of the nest and throws them over the edge. (\"What are you doing, Mom? You are wrecking my room.\")<\/p>\n  \n  <p>She seemingly pays no attention to the concerns of her young as she prepares to pull the nest apart, for she is determined that those little ones will fly, and she knows something they don\u2019t. She knows they will never fly as long as they remain in the nest.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, looking at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1-Os0l7Ac\">this very interesting documentary on white-tailed eagle<\/a>, the young eagles don't learn to fly by getting pushed as described in the motivational video, but they learned flying by practicing their wings on good winds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking from the nesting place (cliff), I read that it might be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle\">Golden Eagle<\/a>. But the section describing the fledgling doesn't say anything about the parent eagle pushing the young, although it does say about \"jumping off\":<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first attempted flight departure can be abrupt, with the young jumping off and using a series of short, stiff wing-beats to glide downward or being blown out of nest while wing-flapping. The initial flight often includes a short flight on unsteady wings followed by an uncontrolled landing.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Does Golden Eagle really push their young to teach them flying? If not, which species is it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In case it's not clear, I am also interested in references that describes the eagle behavior in more details. It would be good if there is a video documentary, but considering that capturing this moment on tape might be difficult, that's not my utmost concern.<\/p>\n","question_id":26361,"tags":["species-identification","ornithology"],"score":6,"down_vote_count":1,"protected_date":1445775145,"is_answered":true,"view_count":10745,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yaE6t.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8198,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8198/honza-zidek","reputation":231,"display_name":"Honza Zidek","accept_rate":50},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XdJ9g.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19432,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19432/akadrhouse","reputation":448,"display_name":"akaDrHouse"},"score":-3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XdJ9g.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19432,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19432/akadrhouse","reputation":448,"display_name":"akaDrHouse"},"score":0,"post_id":39905,"edited":false,"creation_date":1445783925,"comment_id":66955,"body":"Thanks for the anonymous down voting.
