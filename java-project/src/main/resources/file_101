With that in mind, any time a value is recorded, body position should also be recorded. It is widely accepted that diastolic pressures while sitting are higher than when a patient is supine by as much as 5 mmHg. When the arm is at the level of the heart, systolic pressure can be 8 mmHg higher, such as when a patient is in the supine position rather than sitting. A patient supporting their own arm (isometric exercise) may increase the pressure readings. If the patient\u2019s back is not supported (i.e., when a patient is seated on an exam table instead of a chair) the diastolic pressure may be increased by 6 mmHg. Crossing the legs also may raise systolic pressure by 2-8 mmHg. Arm position plays a dramatic role in value errors as well. If the arm is below the level of the heart, values will be too high; if the arm is above the level of the heart, values will be underestimated. For every inch the arm is above or below the level of the heart, a 2 mmHg difference will be found (Pickering et al. Circ 2005;111:697-716).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So if you are comparing your own blood pressure day-to-day, make sure you keep a consistent position.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if you are reading guidelines for healthy/risk blood pressures, make sure you take this into account.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10532,"question_id":10531,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10531/blood-pressure-difference-while-seated-and-laid-down","last_activity_date":1379838262,"creation_date":1379813160,"answer_count":1,"title":"Blood pressure difference while seated and laid down","body":"<p>My blood pressure readings differ a lot when I read them while seated and while I lay down on a bed. <\/p>\n\n<p>I tie the strap in both cases to my left bicep and rest for a minute before noting the readings down.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, one reading I took was:<\/p>\n\n<p>Seated: 130-85\nLaying on bed: 115-75<\/p>\n\n<p>These were noted down one after the other.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if there should be this much difference in the readings and is this something to be worried about.<\/p>\n","question_id":10531,"tags":["blood-pressure"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":1,"closed_reason":"off-topic","is_answered":true,"view_count":58131,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1379817638},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8351210c1a9da3503fdc991cb9d99c77?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":657,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/657/woliveirajr","reputation":138,"display_name":"woliveirajr"},"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"Sancho"},"score":3,"post_id":10527,"edited":false,"creation_date":1379699692,"comment_id":13937,"body":"Despite me having answered, I think this is off-topic for skeptics, because you&#39;re not asking us to verify/falsify a particular claim.

Our \"rate\" of development/ageing is lower, which is completely related to our reproductive strategies. <\/p>\n\n<p>I imagine that a very similar story is true for plants - for some it will be advantageous for them to \"live fast, die young\", whereas for others the best strategy might be to take a long time creating less, but more robust, offspring.<\/p>\n\n<h3>At the molecular level<\/h3>\n\n<p>I have answered a related question previously (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2055/do-trees-age-on-a-microscopic-level/\">Do trees age on a microscopic level?<\/a>) which might be of interest to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, the phenotype of ageing is associated with irreparable damage at the molecular level - be it to DNA, organelles, protein aggregations... you name it! Organisms that have a higher metabolic rate, such as mice, accumulate this damage faster. This gives them the benefit of being able to reproduce much earlier, at the cost of reduced overall lifespan.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plants age slightly differently, but at the genetic level much the same repair pathways are conserved throughout the kingdoms of life, with some alterations of course - for instance plants seem almost completely immune to cancer (2)! <\/p>\n\n<p>As I argue in the linked to question above, plants have a potentially indefinite replicative potential, as every cell has the capability of regenerating its telomeres, because plants do not have a conserved germ line as animals do - any cutting from a plant has the potential to create an entirely new plant. This varies from plant to plant of course, and plants are still susceptible to damage, they just have modified/adapted repair pathways to cope with their specific lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n<p>You ask whether it is the telomeres or the \"rate\" that differs between the plants - the answer is almost certainly a combination of both, amongst the other myriad of factors that influence lifespan!<\/p>\n\n<h3>Refs<\/h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Colado, et al, 2013. <strong>Telomere dynamics in mice and humans<\/strong>. <em>Seminars in hematology<\/em> [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23956466\" rel=\"nofollow\">PubMed<\/a>]<\/li>\n<li>Doonan &amp; Sablowski, 2010. <strong>Walls around tumours - why plants do not develop cancer<\/strong>. <em>Nature reviews cancer<\/em> [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrc2942\" rel=\"nofollow\">DOI<\/a>]<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":10513,"question_id":5589,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1379688678}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5589/difference-in-telomeres-between-a-thale-cress-plant-and-a-methuselah-tree","last_activity_date":1379688678,"creation_date":1356511351,"answer_count":1,"title":"Difference In Telomeres Between A Thale Cress Plant And A Methuselah Tree","body":"<p>From what I have read and understood telomeres cap off how many times a cell can divide before it can no longer divide and that is what causes aging.<\/p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana\" rel=\"nofollow\">thale cress plant<\/a> apparently has a life cycle of 6 weeks before it dies, while the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_%28tree%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Methuselah tree<\/a> has set the record at over 4,800+ years.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is the difference between these two plants regarding their telomeres?<\/li>\n<li>Is the cell division rate different between both plants instead of a telomeres difference?<\/li>\n<li>If given ideal conditions what could the potential life-span of a Methuselah tree be?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Btw you don't have to answer all these.

The longer answer is the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>I am a professional researcher in brain ischemia (ischemia = no blood flow), which is the topic of the question. Armatus' answer was correct insofar as neurons have very limited energy reserves and therefore loose ATP very quickly. Gianpaolo R gave the correct time course for ATP loss.  However, Gianpaolo R's explanation of cell death applies only if the ischemia lasts for about 20-30 minutes.  In this case, the cells swell and lyse by a process called necrosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if the duration without blood flow (which is the duration with no oxygen and nutrients) is less than 20 - 30 minutes, then the cells do not die by necrosis.  It is less well-known to lay people, but well-known to neurologists that the neurons will die days or weeks after the ischemia in a process called \"delayed neuronal death\".<\/p>\n\n<p>What is also less known to lay people is that if the duration of ischemia is less than about 7 minutes (this depends on the species, e.g. human, rat mouse, etc), no neurons die, and in fact, they are protected for a short while from a similar insult.  This is a phenomenon known as \"ischemic preconditioning\".<\/p>\n\n<p>The explanation of necrosis is uncontroversial.  However, no one knows what causes delayed neuronal death or preconditioning responses.  The excitotoxicity mentioned by Armatus is a popular theory in the field, that has been largely discredited for a variety of reasons I will not go into here.  It is also popular to believe the delayed neuronal death is due to a process called apoptosis, but this also has fallen out of favor in recent years.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, right now, there are many competing ideas as to why the neurons die in a delayed fashion, and the simple fact is, no one knows for sure why they die in this way.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you may imagine, being a worker in this field, I have a theory that I think is the most feasible of all.  But it is a mathematical theory that applies to any injured cell, not just neurons deprived of blood flow.  The theory is very simple conceptually.  It says that when a cell is injured it gets damaged (call it D), but also activates genetic responses to protect itself (call this S).  If the genetic protective responses are greater than the damage, that is, if S > D, then the cell recovers and lives.  If the damage is greater than the stress responses (D > S), the cell dies.  The rate at which the cell recovers or dies is inversely proportional to |D - S| after D and S have run their course interacting with each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>This last statement precisely answers your questions. Neurons will die quickly when |D-S| is a large number.  They will die slowly when |D-S| is a small number.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, this is just a qualitative description. The theory actually consists of mathematical equations that predict many things. You will note it is a true theory and does not rely on the biological specifics of the system under study. I am currently measuring the theory in my lab.  I am confident it will be a very useful theory not only for explaining brain ischemia, but many other forms of cell injury.<\/p>\n\n<p>The original article detailing this theory can be obtained <a href=\"http://www.med.wayne.edu/degracialab/PDFs/2012B1%20DeGracia%20et%20al%20jcbfm201210a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">at this link.<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":10508,"question_id":7553,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1379650890}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7553/why-do-neurons-die-so-fast-without-oxygen-and-nutrients","last_activity_date":1379650890,"creation_date":1363504611,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why do neurons die so fast without oxygen and nutrients?","body":"<p>Some human tissue can survive without oxygen a couple of minutes, even hours. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why are the neurons are so \"weak\" and depends so much on oxygen and other nutrients and cannot live without them for more than a few seconds or 1 or 2 minutes?<\/p>\n\n<p>Are they missing some parts of their cells which can store nutrients for worse times in favor of their function or what is the case?<\/p>\n","question_id":7553,"tags":["neuroscience"],"score":6,"accepted_answer_id":7831,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":6107,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1363509069},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28d155a0c7bc791dd65232f0ae87cff6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4423,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4423/tdog2","reputation":20,"display_name":"tdog2"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c795e351e4a7fb62fbe075e81f19f929?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4427,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4427/xuanji","reputation":313,"display_name":"xuanji"},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28d155a0c7bc791dd65232f0ae87cff6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4423,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4423/tdog2","reputation":20,"display_name":"tdog2"},"score":0,"post_id":10338,"edited":false,"creation_date":1378655395,"comment_id":13630,"body":"Hi thanks.

Example: bee workers lay their own eggs rather than tending those of the queen. \"Laziness\" or \"inactivity\" of bee or other social insect workers is incredibly widespread, but it is not clear that it is selfish: it may be a side-effect of imperfect task allocation, or those individuals may be a reserve work force. \"Robbing\" in bees usually refers to removal of nectar or pollen from flowers without pollinating them.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Cheating\" associated with illicit reproduction is widespread in social insects, including in bees, and there's a broad literature on it (search terms \"anarchist\" \"queenright\", \"policing\") but it sounds like your question concerns differential effort and environmental resources specifically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Differential effort in labor (\"laziness vs. busynesss\") has been seen in many social animals. The way you frame the question seems to be in terms of:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"how many lazy individuals can a society tolerate given environmental\n  conditions?\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most observational/experimental studies seem to have approached the question in terms of:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"how can what appears to be cheating actually be adaptive?\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs001140050528\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kukuk et al.<\/a> suggest that in Halictine bees, lazy bees who avoid the high-mortality-risk foraging tasks are actually acting as caretakers and orphan-rearers for the brood of the foraging busy bees. It's also been proposed that apparently lazy insects act as a \"defensive reserve\" for the nest, although at least in <em>Bombus impatiens<\/em>, experiments show no evidence that lazy bees defend any more than busy bees (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZW1haWwuYXJpem9uYS5lZHV8ZHItamFuZHR8Z3g6NmY0Y2JmYWM1NjU2ZDk4ZQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jandt et al.<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Lazy individuals could also be acting a labor reserve (\"substitute helpers\"), in case of food or colony depletion. To me, this scenario is the closest to what you mention \u2013 the idea that lazy individuals become busier, either voluntarily or through coercion, in time of need. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0745\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baglione et al.<\/a> show that this is the case for carrion crows, and quantify it to some degree along the terms you suggest.

Several possible reasons might lead to this:- <\/p>\n\n<p>1) The existing metabolic pathways are all intertwined to form a complex metabolic net. This means that invariably, the intermediates of any pathway are the products or intermediates of several other pathways. Therefore, the G3P shuttles require Glycerol-phosphate and Glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase (I and II) which might be naturally abundant in brain owing to its use in strict lipid metabolic control in nervous tissue. This means that tapping the already high G3P for use as a shuttle compared to synthesising and operating a distinct metabolic shuttle is more profitable. Furthermore, operating Malate aspartate shuttle migh require intermediates whose high concentrations (required to maintain the shuttle) might negatively interfere with existing metabolic pathways like protein synthesis and regulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) This shuttle has much faster operation time than Malate-Aspartate shuttle and hence is very useful in shuttling reducing equivalents fast in muscles and brain. Compared to the malate aspartate shuttle, it is shorter and hence faster and less prone to cessation due to unavailable intermediates or enzymatic disruption. Due to several enzymes working in Malate-aspartate shuttle, it has a narrower pH and temperature optima than the G3P shuttle which is shorter and depends on lesser intermediates, and hence is less prone to disruption.<\/p>\n\n<p>3)The last and the most far-fetched (but relevant)reason is that the loss of one ATP may not cause much of a problem because of already high respiratory rate, high Oxygen delivery to brain and ability of the body to quickly transfer available energy sources to brain at the cost of other parts, at times of energy stress. This means that replacing the shuttle with a more energetically conserving one may not have a strong driving force for evolution to operate on, and therefore the presence of G3P may be because of something like phylogenetic inertia, that is, the prevalence of an ancestral character just because it is neutral and does not influence the fitness in a considerable manner.

Pretty much whenever a neuron's involved, the interesting biology is multi-scale.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Is the membrane continuous along these tubules, or does the tubule just end somewhere inside the muscle fiber?<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The membranes are continuous.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>When the muscle is twitching...<\/strong> is this neurological of nature, or is it related to a molecular cause in the muscle itself?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most things you'd call a muscle twitch are at the whole-muscle-group scale, involving the coordinated contraction of many individual motor units, so it's basically neurological.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>When the muscle is cramping...<\/strong> I'm almost certain this arises in the muscle. What causes it? A malfunction with regard to the calcium ions?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A <em>muscle cramp<\/em> is a colloquialism for a couple of things that are quite different from each other. Overall, as with the previous question, if someone's experiencing a muscle cramp that means it's a fairly macroscopic phenomenon and it likely involves a whole group of muscle filaments, so it's neurological. Most spasms and cramps are neurologically mediated. <\/p>\n\n<p>The connections with electrolyte balances (cramps from low sodium, potassium, magnesium, or calcium) also hint at the neurological basis because neurons act on each other (and on muscles) by forming or dissipating ion gradients. You may know that low dietary calcium can lead to muscle cramps; if this was relevant to the calcium release within the myocyte (from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) then the calcium-starved muscles wouldn't be expected to chronically contract (which requires calcium) but to chronically relax. <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, there's a lot of room for feedback mechanisms. So, let's say a person experiences a muscle tear; the tear is small enough that it doesn't compromise the function of the entire muscle group. In this case it's adaptive for the local damage to 'signal' to the rest of the muscle group to initiate spasm so as to stabilize the damaged structures as they're repaired. In this scenario the local damage would 'inform' a neurological (and/or endocrine) response that actually effects the spasm.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lastly, and on a slightly different subject, <strong>what are the microlesions in the muscles that occur during strength training, and what is the overcompensation that happens?<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Last time I was updated on this (not my bag), there were some large questions remaining. The tricks used by growing muscle to establish large, regular arrays of contractile machinery, that is organized over many spatial orders of magnitude, are poorly understood. There are structures that monitor the overall organization and that detect any large deformations. Regarding overcompensation, let's play through a generic scenario. A muscle cell is loaded too much and becomes physically damaged. It has to stop taking orders (stop responding to contraction/relaxation signals) and to initiate repairs. The overcompensation results because muscle cell's not really capable of knowing how large it was before the damage, so the safe amount of repairs to do is <em>extra.<\/em> Probably there are epigenetic processes that let a muscle cell 'count' the number of times its been greatly damaged and to scale-up the response appropriately.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you just consider two likely sources of damage -- mechanical strain and lactic acidosis -- you can see that there are widely different mechanisms that would be required to detect the damage and to initiate repairs. <\/p>\n","answer_id":10437,"question_id":7121,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7121/molecular-cause-of-cramps-spasms-and-strengthening-in-muscles-incl-intro-to","last_activity_date":1379209425,"creation_date":1360261819,"answer_count":1,"title":"Molecular cause of cramps, spasms and strengthening in muscles?

This is an important one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The above principle follows from transition-state theory, which holds that the activated state for the reaction in one direction is that same for that in the reverse direction.  It also follows from the principle of microscopic reversibility at equilibrium or, more correctly, the principle of detailed balance at equilibrium, which states that \u201cin a system at equilibrium each collision has its exact counterpart in the reverse direction, and that <strong>the rate of every chemical process is exactly balanced by that of the reverse process<\/strong>\u201d (my emphasis) [Laidler, 1987, p 130]. It is important to realise that these two points of view are equivalent.  To again quote Laidler (p130), if one is working within the framework of TST \u201cthe principle of microscopic reversibility presents nothing new\u201d. <\/p>\n\n<p>To put it bluntly: a system where any elementary reaction, either explicitly or implicitly, is not exactly balanced by the reverse process is not at equilibrium. By this criteria, the actin example alluded to above <em>cannot<\/em>, even loosely, be considered at equilibrium. <\/p>\n\n<p>This principle has many important consequences, even when a system is not at equilibrium.  One is that the the <strong>product of the ratios<\/strong> of rate constants around a cycle (closed loop) equal the equilibrium constant for the cycle (see Cornish-Bowden, 2004, p 104). [see Addendum for an example of where this consequence was not adhered to].<\/p>\n\n<p>(b) When a species is in a steady-state, the rate of formation equals the rate of breakdown. The steady-state concentration may differ markedly from the equilibrium concentration.<\/p>\n\n<p>(c) As <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg\">@WYSIWYG<\/a> has <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/10303/1136\">pointed out<\/a>, an enzyme (catalyst) does not change the equilibrium constant for the uncatalyzed reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>(d) When we are dealing with equilibria, we are usually interested in Gibbs free energy changes.  For example (Silbey &amp; Alberty, 2001, p 277).<\/p>\n\n<p>&#916;G<sup>o<\/sup>' = -RT ln K\u2019 <\/p>\n\n<p>(In the above equation K\u2019 is the apparent equilibrium constant, that is the equilibrium constant at specified pH, and &#916;G<sup>o<\/sup>' is the standard transformed Gibbs free energy of a biochemical reaction.  More on this distinction, if you are interested, in the Silbey and Alberty reference quoted above). <\/p>\n\n<p>The important point is that there is a relatively simple relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant. The Gibbs free energy, of course, gives a measure of the spontaneity of a reaction and also its capacity to do work.  <\/p>\n\n<p>When the transformed Gibbs free energy is of a reaction (&#916;G') is zero, the reaction (at specified pH) is at equilibrium and cannot perform useful work, and reactions with negative &#916;G' may be considered \u2018spontaneous\u2019.  It is also important to realize that equilibrium is a dynamic state: chemical bonds are continuously being broken and energy is continuously being redistributed (with no loss of energy). [I am dealing here with the transformed free energy, &#916;G', that is the free energy change at specified pH, rather than &#916;G (the pH independent value), as this is the most useful when considering a biochemical reaction.  However, similar conclusions apply to &#916;G]. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Having got those out of the way, I can now attempt to answer your question (slightly rephrased). Can a reaction in a metabolic pathway be at equilibrium?  <\/p>\n\n<p>To be extremely pedantic, if there is a flux through the pathway (net conversion of first substrate to end product) then the answer is <em>no<\/em> (Newsholme &amp; Start, 1973, p 11). That is, if there is a flux through the pathway, &#916;G' cannot be exactly zero for any individual reaction.   However, <strong>reactions in a metabolic pathway may be very close to equilibrium<\/strong> (Newsholme &amp; Start, 1973, chapter 1).<\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s (once again) rephrase your question.  Are there any examples of reactions in metabolic pathways that are close to equilibrium, and how can we determine this?<\/p>\n\n<p>To again quote Newsholme &amp; Start (1973, p11)  \u201cIn a series of reactions that constitute a metabolic pathway, a few may be displaced far from equilibrium, whereas the majority of reactions may be close to equilibrium\u201d. <\/p>\n\n<p>So how can this be determined? One way would be to measure the ratio of products to substrates (or the ratio of product to substrate pairs) in the cell, and compare this with the equilibrium constant.  Note that it is only the ratio of substrate/product pairs we are interested in, not the absolute concentrations. We might be interested in the NAD<sup>+<\/sup>/NADH ratio in the cell, for example.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That is, we measure the <strong>mass action ratio<\/strong> and compare this with the equilibrium constant.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Such measurements are fraught with difficulties, but let\u2019s agree that they can be made. We could rapidly freeze the tissue sample to -190&deg;C (using liquid nitrogen), for example, and then measure the ratio of metabolites.  Finally, it should be pointed out that comparison of mass-action ratio with the equilibrium constant is not the only way of deducing that a reaction is near equilibrium, and agreement between alternative methods is highly desirable before any firm conclusions are drawn. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s consider glycolysis as an example.  It is generally agreed that the reactions catalyzed by <a href=\"http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ec:5.3.1.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">phosphoglucoisomerase<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoglycerate_mutase\" rel=\"nofollow\">phosphoglycerate mutase<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoglycerate_mutase\" rel=\"nofollow\">enolase<\/a> are all close to equilibrium: the mass action ratios and the equilibrium constants are about the same (see Newsholme &amp; Start, 1973, p 98).  <\/p>\n\n<p>It is also generally agreed that the reactions catalyzed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphofructokinase\" rel=\"nofollow\">phosphofructokinase<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_kinase\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyruvate kinase<\/a> are far from equilibrium (see Newsholme &amp; Start, 1973, p 98).  <\/p>\n\n<p>What is the rationale? In general, it is control reactions catalyzed by regulatory enzymes that are displaced from equilibrium. (A key property of a regulatory enzyme is that the activity is controlled by factors other than substrate concentration). <\/p>\n\n<p>The enzyme <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphofructokinase\" rel=\"nofollow\">phosphofructokinase<\/a> is a good example.  This enzyme plays a key role in the regulation of glycolysis. Measurement of the mass-action ratio for this enzyme gives a value of 0.029, where the equilibrium constant for the reaction is about 1000 (see Newsholme &amp; Start, 1973, p31). It is clear that physiologically this enzyme catalyzes a reaction that is far from equilibrium. <\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, many reactions in metabolic pathways may be close to equilibrium, but regulatory enzymes almost always catalyze reactions that are displaced from equilibrium.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if anyone wishes to provide more recent references or to otherwise improve the answer, feel free to edit. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>For a well-known controversy in the enzyme kinetics field where the requirement that product of the ratios of rate constants around a closed loop equal the equilibrium constant for the cycle was not adhered to, see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1134645/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selwyn (1993)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1130917/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Topham &amp; Brocklehurst (1992)<\/a>.

If you work with a proper lab, you will be inindated with vendors trying to sell you these and many others.<\/p>\n\n<p>But to answer your question, if you are looking to purchase many such items <a href=\"http://www.atcc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATCC<\/a> is an excellent resource.  Not only will you have to meet regulatory requirements, but you will also have to deal with a great many MTA's depending on what you are trying to get. <\/p>\n\n<p>In response to edit: Salmonella is actually not normally a <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000294.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">serious<\/a> pathogen to a healthy adult.  It is, however, still a human pathogen and should be handled under BSL2 conditions.  So if you have the funds and time to setup a BSL2 lab at your house, by all means go to town.  And I hope you don't live with any children, the elderly, or otherwise immunocompromised individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>In response to further edits: \nIf you just want to look at things under the scope, then I suggest you get started by making your own homemade culture plates.  If you can get your hands on some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogeny_broth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lysogeny Broth<\/a> (LB), agar, and petri dishes then you can make lb plates like a researcher in a real lab (minus an autoclave but you could use a pressure cooker).  These are items the public could get, but might be harder to come by.<\/p>\n\n<p>I however will assume that you want to make your own plates from common household ingredients (I used to do this a lot as kid, whatever that says about me).<\/p>\n\n<p>**<\/p>\n\n<h2>Making your own culture dishes:<\/h2>\n\n<p>**<\/p>\n\n<p>1) The \"plates\" themselves.  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I recommend getting the smallest Tupperware like\ncontainers your can find that are microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and\nreally make a good seal (water tight at the least).  They really\ndon't have to be big, and you will make your life easier if you buy a\nbunch to match.<\/li>\n<li>They need to be super clean.  After running them through your\ndishwasher at home, put them all in a boiling pot of water until you\nare ready to pour in your \"media.\" A mid-low simmer will work<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note that you won't probably be able to have perfect sterile technique at your house, but you should try to do what you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Your \"Media\" or Broth<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I highly recommend using pectin as your gelling agent if you can't\nget your hands on some agar.  After that comes plain unflavored\ngelatin, but I recommend pectin.  You can get it at almost any\ngrocery store and my recipe is made assuming that.  You can determine\nhow much you want to make, just scale up the ratios.  I'm going to\nlist things as rough volume by volume so you won't need a scale.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>i) Make the powder first:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>45mL of pectin;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>4 bouillon cubes ground as finely as you can (you can get different\ntypes and results depending on if you start with vegetable, beef, or\nchicken.  I recommend starting with vegetable.);<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>125mL of refined white sugar; <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Additives (more on this later)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><em>ii) Mix the powder into 500mL of water<\/em><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Before you mix in the powder, hear the water to 50-75oC (mid low\nheat), but not boiling.  Mix the powder in while stirring until\ndissolved.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>iii) <em>Bring the mixture up to a boil.<\/em><br>\nLet it boil for about 2 min, stirring all the while.<\/p>\n\n<p>iv) <em>Cover the pot and let it cool for 4-5 min.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>You by no means want it cool down to room temperature, you just want to get it a little below boiling.  If you are at 55oC or bellow it's definitely time move on.<\/p>\n\n<p>v) <em>Dip/fill your \"plates\" 1/3 full of media using clean/sterile utensils and seal while hot but not boiling.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed this seems an awful lot like canning, and that's because it is.  Again you want to be as clean as possible in this step and of course try not to burn yourself on anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>vi) <em>Let your media plates set and chill over night in the refrigerator.<\/em>  <\/p>\n\n<p>You really probably only have to wait a few hours if you are anxious to get going.  You are going to want to store the plates that you are not using in the refrigerator anyway.  Also if you made a bunch of plates, let the cool on a counter before you put them in the fridge so that you don't raise the temp of your fridge too much.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remember the thing about additives?  You can play around with adding different amounts and different types of salts, vitamins, food, or other items to see how they effect the cultures you get to grow.  All kinds of fun there.  First go round, leave them all out.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Now you have your own home made culture plates!<\/strong>  The above recipe was empirically tested by my childhood, and repeated by my son's.  Not all pectin from the store may be equal, this is with Ball Classic (I have no relation to the company).  I'd love to know people's results in trying it, because I might need to re-think how/what I'm doing to get it to work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Go around your house swabbing things with sterile swabs (you can get these at a drug store), and then streak them out on plate.  While it will be a little different with a swab and homemade plate, the idea is similar to what is done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAm21yPGMRo\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leave your plate in a warm wet place, but not in direct sunlight.  Ideal temp is going to be around 37, but you can leave them above and below that and still get things to grow.  On top of our dryer is where I leave.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a day or so you should have colonies you can streak out on a slide and look under a scope.  You will find all kinds of things this way.  If you want a more formal way to put things on a slide, you can check out dry and wet mounting from a Google search.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are actually quite likely to run into E.coli if you sample enough \"areas\" this way.  Obviously don't eat or huff the stuff that ends up growing.

I suppose it is possible to get a nascent RNA strand copied into cDNA, but I've never heard of that being done.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because cDNA is dsDNA, the original strand is made from your mRNA as the complementary strand, but then you dispose of the RNA and make the second strand to get a stable, reproducable molecule. The total dsDNA molecule is what we refer to as cDNA (not a single strand of this material).<\/p>\n\n<p>consider this simplified DNA molecule:<\/p>\n\n<p>ATG-INTRON-CTCTAG<\/p>\n\n<p>TAC-INTRON-GAGATC<\/p>\n\n<p>this could be transcribed into the following mRNA (corresponding to Met-INTRON-Leu-Stop):<\/p>\n\n<p>AUG-INTRON-CUCUAG<\/p>\n\n<p>before nuclear export the intron is removed, making mature mRNA:<\/p>\n\n<p>AUGCUCUAG<\/p>\n\n<p>you make cDNA from this:<\/p>\n\n<p>ATGCTCTAG<\/p>\n\n<p>TACGAGATC<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you have both a coding and a complementary strand in your cDNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for directionality on the chromosome, genes can be in either direction (meaning that they can use either strand as the coding strand), but remember that the forces that contribute to transcription are just locally determined (assembly of transcription factors, etc) and pay no heed to what direction they're going or strand they are on relative to any other gene. The strands are labeled as positive and negative, but that's just a reference for orientation.

This confuses me, since usually it is said to refer to DNA that is complementary to mRNA.  Is this correct?  Is it restricted to mature mRNA?<\/p>\n\n<p>I also find directionality very confusing.  As I understand it, mRNA has a sequence equivalent (less introns, after splicing) to the so-called 'coding strand' of DNA.  Does this mean that cDNA made from mRNA, at least before treated with a DNA polymerase, is also complementary to the original genomic DNA?  Is this the better definition (I have seen this used as well, though the first definition seems far more common).<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as I understand it each chromosome has a forward and reverse strand, defined by convention, but that the 'coding' strand of a given gene is random.

The structure of the main part of an enzyme determines which coenzyme or which prosthetic group will work with the concerned enzyme. Unlike most other TCA cycle enzymes, Succinic Dehydrogenase involves the participation of $FAD$ rather than $NAD$ and that is a consequence of its specific structure.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Another possible reason might have to do with the energy gap available. The conversion of succinate to fumarate liberates less free energy as compared to other oxidation reactions. Ususally, the steps which are coupled with NADH reduction have a free energy change of about $\\Delta G=-100$ to $-150Kcal/mol$ but the conversion catalysed by succinic dehydrogenase has a free energy change of $-80Kcal/mol$ (rough figures) and hence releases less energy. It therefore might not be feasible to couple with $NADH$ reduction but it would be favourable (thermodynamically) to couple with an easy-to-reduce (since the reduction potential is higher and hence reduction is more favourable) and hence less energetic molecule $FADH_2$.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Apart from structural and thermodynamic requirement, one last possible reason might be that succinic dehydrogenase is a part of the mitochondrial membrane and involved in the Electron Transport Chain. Here, flavin molecules are excellent electron transporters (in comparison to nicotinamide based reductants) and therefore it might be more profitable to use a flavin based reductant to later facilitate easy electron transport and proton transfer.<br>\nAgain all these are probable reasons and I dont know for sure.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10315,"question_id":10313,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1378530514}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10313/why-is-fadh2-made-instead-of-nadh-in-one-of-the-reaction-of-krebs-cycle","last_activity_date":1378530514,"creation_date":1378489536,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is FADH2 made instead of NADH in one of the reaction of Krebs cycle?","body":"<p>FADH2 is made in conversion of Succinate to Fumarate.

TCA cycle is coupled with ETC at certain steps which makes it essentially a part of aerobic metabolism. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The reason for having a dedicated organelle for respiration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>ATP synthesis is a membrane process. Imagine a large prokaryotic cell- as big as an animal cell. Such a cell cannot take care of its energetic demands which primarily consists of protein synthesis with the given area of membrane i.e it needs much more ATP-synthases than it can have to cope up with the energy demands of maintaining such a huge cell (this index is approximated based on surface to volume ratio). Therefore it is wise to harbor multiple efficient organelles i.e. mitochondria which themselves have just a small essential genome and proteome to maintain.<\/p>\n\n<p>For better understanding please read <a href=\"http://www.nick-lane.net/Lane-Martin%20Nature%20hypothesis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article by Nick Lane.

Most traits, especially those as complex as color, are controlled by many alleles at many loci.  That's why there are different kinds of brown, blond, and red hair in the population.  There is no \"hair color gene.\"  A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n12/full/ng.2007.13.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">fascinating paper<\/a> came out a few years ago, identifying <strong><em>dozens<\/em><\/strong> of SNPs playing a role in hair and eye color.  It's a deep, deep rabbit hole that we have only begun to plunge into.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To summarize, it's <strong>very<\/strong> complex.  This paper performed genome-wide association scans looking at two comparisons each for eyes (Blue and green, blue and brown), hair (red or not, blond or brown), and skin (freckles, sun-sensitivity).  The researchers looked in a group of Icelandic and Dutch individuals, which means they only looked at a small portion of human variability (i.e., very few African or Asian genomes, for example).  Still, just from those simple comparisons, their scans:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>revealed 104 associations that reached genome-wide significance, accounted for by 60 distinct SNPs, of which 32 showed genome-wide association with only one pigmentation trait, 12 with two traits and 16 with three traits.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say, they found 60 DNA bases that explained their data.  Roughly half of those only affected one thing (eye, or hair, or skin, but only one), a fifth of those single base changes contributed to two different traits, and a full 25% of those SNPs were related with three traits.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's still pretty hefty.  Basically, they found 60 things that can affect hair, eye, or skin color, and some of those can affect some or all of those at the same time.  And they only looked at people from two countries.  Here's a figure where they summarize the seven strongest SNPs; you can see how tricky it can be to explain colors.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fPEpc.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":9948,"question_id":9947,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1377730244}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9947/what-hair-color-will-result-in-someone-inheriting-both-blond-and-ginger-genes","last_activity_date":1378341612,"creation_date":1377292885,"answer_count":1,"title":"What hair color will result in someone inheriting both blond and ginger genes?","body":"<p>Both the genes for blond hair and ginger hair are recessive, so they need both parents to give the same gene for it to take affect.

First off, what is your definition of loci?  That term is broad, and can be construed to mean everything from large, megabase-length genes to every individual base.<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, it turns out there are some serious runs of homozygosity (ROH, meaning long regions of the genome that are homozygous) in human populations.  This of course will vary widely from population to population, and amongst outbred individuals.  <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.06.014\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper<\/a> has some AMAZING figures that are worth checking out but are a little more involved.

For an extreme example, look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human leukocyte antigen<\/a>; some have hundreds or thousands of alleles, but if you were homozygous for each it would be bad (disease susceptibility) but you'd be fine otherwise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, it depends on what you consider an allele or locus.  Most studies look at single base changes (SNPs) because they are 1. easy and 2. useful.  It turns out that there are <strong>a lot<\/strong> of these single changes.  The Human HapMap project is hard at work on this and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/full/nature06258.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently published<\/a> a data set with 3.1 million of these SNPs, among 270 individuals from different populations, roughly one every kilobase.  In a similar vein, the <a href=\"http://www.1000genomes.org/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">1000 genomes<\/a> project <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently published<\/a> an enormous catalog of variation from almost 1,110 individuals in 14 populations.  Both projects focused on major variants.<\/p>\n\n<p>The best answer I can give you from these studies is that, within a given population, any two DNA strands are around 80% identical, of which around 0.5% is by direct relation (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/fig_tab/nature06258_T5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">table 5<\/a>.  Those numbers vary <em>hugely<\/em> between populations, with Yoruba Nigerians being the most diverse, followed by Utah Whites and then Han Chinese and Tokyo Japanese.  This is just an average across the entire genome, as purported functional differences are comparably rare, with over <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html#f4\" rel=\"nofollow\">85% of protein-altering changes<\/a> being very rare (&lt;0.5% frequency).<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, almost every single site we know of has more than one version <em>somewhere<\/em>.  Most traits are <strong>very<\/strong> complex and are affected by many genes, so even similar appearances can come from very different genetics.  Individuals tend to be highly heterozygous, even if populations on a whole have limited heterozygosity.  A single pair of siblings mating can produce massive defects, showing just how necessary our heterozygosity is.  We each have dozens of large, lethal mutations (deletions, mostly) that don't usually matter thanks to heterozygosity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10257,"question_id":10244,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1378317377}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10244/amount-of-heterozygosity","last_activity_date":1378317377,"creation_date":1378266234,"answer_count":2,"title":"Amount of Heterozygosity","body":"<p>How many loci in the human genome are heterozygous?

It really depends on how you define \"strongest\" (Newtons, Wattage, Newtons per Kilogram, etc.). Here are a few relevant excerpts from the article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In ordinary parlance, muscular \"strength\" usually refers to <strong>the ability to exert a force on an external object<\/strong>\u2014for example, lifting a weight. By this definition, the <strong>masseter<\/strong> or jaw muscle is the strongest. The 1992 Guinness Book of Records records the achievement of a bite strength of 4,337 N (975 lbf) for 2 seconds. What distinguishes the masseter is not anything special about the muscle itself, but its advantage in working against a much shorter lever arm than other muscles.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If \"strength\" refers to <strong>the force exerted by the muscle itself<\/strong>, e.g., on the place where it inserts into a bone, then the strongest muscles are those with the largest cross-sectional area. This is because the tension exerted by an individual skeletal muscle fiber does not vary much. Each fiber can exert a force on the order of 0.3 micronewton. By this definition, the strongest muscle of the body is usually said to be the <strong>quadriceps femoris<\/strong> or the <strong>gluteus maximus<\/strong>.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>heart<\/strong> has a claim to being <strong>the muscle that performs the largest quantity of physical work in the course of a lifetime<\/strong>. Estimates of the power output of the human heart range from 1 to 5 watts.[14] This is much less than the maximum power output of other muscles; for example, the quadriceps can produce over 100 watts, but only for a few minutes. The heart does its work continuously over an entire lifetime without pause, and thus does \"outwork\" other muscles. An output of one watt continuously for eighty years yields a total work output of two and a half gigajoules.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":10260,"question_id":10252,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10252/strongest-muscle-of-human-body","last_activity_date":1378308831,"creation_date":1378285667,"answer_count":1,"title":"Strongest muscle of Human Body","body":"<p>Which is the strongest muscle of human body ? <\/p>\n\n<p>Confusion b/w <strong>Masseter muscle<\/strong> (Muscle of Jaw) and <strong>Tongue<\/strong> and <strong>Muscle of Heart<\/strong> and <strong>Muscle of Uterus<\/strong>. <\/p>\n","question_id":10252,"tags":["muscles"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":10260,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":674,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1378302449},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecfb0841501bfed29138b6db176b21da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4347,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4347/xl-at-china","reputation":159,"display_name":"XL _at_China"},"closed_date":1406807167,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/130205fccd66358b840329ba46c38ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4168,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4168/miguel-%c3%81ngel-naranjo-ortiz","reputation":1487,"display_name":"Miguel Ángel Naranjo Ortiz"},"score":0,"post_id":10243,"edited":false,"creation_date":1378247652,"comment_id":13489,"body":"Are you talking about protein nomenclature or what?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecfb0841501bfed29138b6db176b21da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4347,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4347/xl-at-china","reputation":159,"display_name":"XL _at_China"},"score":0,"post_id":10243,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/130205fccd66358b840329ba46c38ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4168,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4168/miguel-%c3%81ngel-naranjo-ortiz","reputation":1487,"display_name":"Miguel Ángel Naranjo Ortiz"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1378248449,"comment_id":13490,"body":"@Miguel&#193;ngelNaranjoOrtiz,no,what I am talking about is the description of the protein structure by formal language,it is research that tries  to predict the structure by DNA or RNA"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/130205fccd66358b840329ba46c38ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4168,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4168/miguel-%c3%81ngel-naranjo-ortiz","reputation":1487,"display_name":"Miguel Ángel Naranjo Ortiz"},"score":0,"post_id":10243,"edited":false,"creation_date":1378249003,"comment_id":13491,"body":"Actually when describing the 3D structure of a protein you only need the angles formed by the peptidic bond of every aminoacid, and the aminoacidic sequence.

The textbook explanation for why a 3-letter code exists is because a 2-letter code cannot describe all the 22 amino acids, with all its permutations.

I can't even speculate the answer to this question; the simple amino acids are fine but for an example why lysine and not a similar amino acid with a shorter side chain - no idea.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, given 22 amino acids, a 3-letter code and 4 nucleotides, the multiple codons for an amino acid are similar in sequence (usually the first two bases are conserved in accordance with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobble_base_pair\" rel=\"nofollow\">wobble hypothesis<\/a>.

Normally, secreted dopamine is cleared from the synapse via the dopamine transporter (DAT) located on presynaptic dopaminergic terminals. Cocaine inhibits\nthis reuptake of dopamine, increasing it's duration of action on post-synaptic dopamine receptors. Thus, cocaine's effect depends on neuronal dopamine production. Without intrinsic dopamine, cocaine would have no effect. This is actual not exactly true though because cocaine also inhibits serotonin and norepinepherine reuptake transporters as well but the same argument applies to those neurotransmitters as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>The overall effect of cocaine on the nervous system is extremely complex as it prolongs the action of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine wherever those reuptake transporters are present. There is a particularly high density of DAT in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens. What these areas of the brain normally do is under intense study and debate. The accumbens may play a role in goal directed behavior and incentive salience, which is the attribution of value to various actions or objects in the environment. This is what naturally guides us to perform one action over another. The simplistic view is that cocaine \"highjacks\" this system such that cocaine itself acquires greater incentive salience than natural reinforcers such as food, sex, money etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>Getting back to the original question regarding why cocaine causes brain atrophy. This appears to be a finding quoted from a paper by the original inquirer. It is not obvious to me what the mechanism of this atrophy would be. I suggest you look at the discussion section of the paper from which that abstract was quoted to see what the authors suggest.

Enlarged striatal volume has frequently been reported in stimulant-dependent individuals,5, 6 possibly reflecting a marker of reduced dopamine neurotransmission in this dopamine-rich brain region where drugs like cocaine work.

Evolution is the process of change through time of species by inherited changes. Heritable differences mainly come about from random mutation in the genome. These genetic differences between individuals lead to fitness differences between individuals, ie one individual is better able to produce offspring, thus spreading more of its genes in to the following generation, than another individual. For example, environmental change causes selection for a dark body morph in moths, stabding genetic variation and new mutations affecting body colour is then more favored by selection, and those with the dark body genes survive and reproduce better.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no end or goal to evolution. It is often mistakenly said that humans have stopped evolving. This is wrong and to suggest we have is to suggest that evolution is directed and has an ultimate goal. As long as genetic fitness variation exists there will always be some level of evolution because there is a difference between individuals in selection coefficient. Selection is also very unstable, it can change drastically an rapidly, evolution could only then stop if selection was constant and favored one \"ultimate genotype\" over all others in which case all genetic variation would cease to exist. <\/p>\n\n<p>If we found another planet which had the exact same conditions and time as earth we may find the same species, but it is not likely. It requires the same mutations and selection processes occurring. Analogous to this is the observation of \"many solutions to one problem\" where different species use different adaptations to deal with a common problem. For example, geting oxygen is difficult for water deelling species. Sea mammals like whales gather oxygen by going to the surface and breathing and then holding their breath. Fish have evolved gills, a different solution to the same problem, to harvest oxygen from the water. These solutions evolve from random changes with selection acting only on the results (those that could filter oxygen from the water or hold their breath the best survived and reproduce best).<\/p>\n","answer_id":10230,"question_id":10229,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1378186092}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10229/i-think-evolution-has-goal","last_activity_date":1378186092,"creation_date":1378179520,"answer_count":1,"title":"I think evolution has goal","body":"<p>Richard Dawkins says evolution doesn't have any goal.

There is a normal range of plasma sodium concentration that ranges from about 135 to 145 mM. You body has multiple endocrinologic and neurological mechanisms to closely regulate this concentration. So even if you went out and ate a ton of salty snacks, your body would still keep your plasma sodium concentration within this range. A salt concentration much lower or greater than this can start to cause problems depending on how fast it happens and how far from the normal value. Brain surgery patient are often given lots of extra salt to keep their brains \"salty\" as this protects from cerebral edema and counteracts salt wasting that often occurs with brain injury. However, the opposite or very high sodium concentrations are also not good. As you said, a diet high in salt can lead to high blood pressure and chronic high blood pressure can cause damage the small blood vessels in the brain and cause small strokes over time or very high blood pressure can cause larger bleeds.

In many biological systems the action of many individuals are coupled together such that when an individual is activated, the others are more likely to act as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>The classic example of cooperativity is hemoglobin a protein which has four sites to bind oxygen (one in each of four protein subunits).  When there is enough oxygen present for a single binding site to bind oxygen, the other three will have an increased affinity for oxygen.  This makes the binding curve relatively steep.  Take a look at the graph. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUvy0.png\" alt=\"saturation of hemoglobin by oxygen\"><\/p>\n\n<p>When one oxygen is bound, three others also become bound. The more individuals in a cooperative system, the sharper the curve becomes until a very small change in a few individuals creates a very large effect very quickly.  \"all or nothing\" as you say. <\/p>\n\n<p>Muscle contraction also is cooperative.  In this case there are many individual muscle fibers, both the myosin thick filaments, and the actin thin filaments.  Each fiber consists of chains of interwoven individual proteins.  When a myosin individual protein acts against a thin filament other myosins in that filament and those on other thick filaments that are bound to the same thin filament will react to the change in tension and also be more likely to activate and pull.  This causes the entire muscle to quickly start to contract together.  Most researches feel that all the various other factors contributing to muscle contraction, calcium release and uptake, other proteins that are associated with the thick and thin filaments etc, are cooperative as well.

The \"developmental sequences\" are just genes like any other. Like all genes they are semi-randomly distributed through the genome. While there are gene-rich and gene-poor areas in the genome, with some exceptions --notably the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox\" rel=\"nofollow\">homeobox genes<\/a>--, genes are not grouped by function.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to how they are accessed sequentially, that is a huge question but it is not specific to embryogenesis.

This is particularly obvious during development but is not exclusive to it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic way this happens is through feedback and control loops. Gene A activates the transcription of gene B which activates gene C which then deactivates A. If you manage to turn on A, the rest will follow.

Simply, the MIC is a basic measurement of how much of any given agent is need to stop the growth of a bacterial colony.  Often we think of current medical antibiotics when thinking of MIC, but even simpler things like table salt and sugar have a MIC for a given species.  Thus this sentence is making the assertion that the bacteria found in the patent have an increased resistance to methicillin but not to penicillin.  This leads us to ask the obvious question:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can Staphylococcus aureus (staph going forward) be methicillin resistant but not penicillin resistant?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is a bit of a trick question, but let's break it down to the needed components: What is Methicillin, what is/are penicillin(s), and how are staph resistant to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>First that it should be noted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin\" rel=\"nofollow\">penicillins<\/a> can actually refer to a whole class of antibiotics which all use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactam\" rel=\"nofollow\">β-Lactam<\/a> and the specific set of antibiotics:  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), procaine benzylpenicillin (procaine\n  penicillin), benzathine benzylpenicillin (benzathine penicillin), and\n  phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin\" rel=\"nofollow\">from wiki<\/a>)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that more correct way to address the whole class of antibiotics would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactam_antibiotic\" rel=\"nofollow\">β-Lactam antibiotics<\/a>, not penicillins, and that if you wanted to talk about more specifically penicillin derived compounds you would be discussing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penam\" rel=\"nofollow\">penams<\/a>.  For even further clarification, penicillin as drug most likely refers to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzylpenicillin\" rel=\"nofollow\">benzylpenicillin<\/a>, and for the rest of this answer I will use penicillin to refer to benzylpenicillin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus we should think of penicillin as an early antibodic that work by preventing the dividing/genesis of cell walls and certain organelles via binding to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin-binding_protein\" rel=\"nofollow\">penicillin binding proteins<\/a> (PBPs).  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Methicillin<\/a> is also a β-Lactam antibiotic, and it's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action\" rel=\"nofollow\">MOA<\/a> is similar to penicillin.  It was developed/discovered after penicillin and was seen a answer to Gram-positive bacteria that were breaking down penicillin via β-lactamase.  Methicillian still works by binding to PBPs, but it escapes the bacteria's counter to penicillin.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads us to address how penicillin resistance and methicillin resistance commonly occur in staph.  First, many staph strains and other bacteria use β-lactamases to breakdown antibiotics so they no longer can bind to PBP's (1).  But methicillin is particularly suited by its side chains to not be degraded by β-lactamases.  In their <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181513/pdf/aac00005-0048.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ground breaking work<\/a> on the subject, Hartman and Tomasz identified that methicillin resistance was not in the acquisition of a β-lactamase, but in a mutation in PBP's that prevented methicillin binding (2).  There they tested 4 strains of staph, two were methicillin resistant (MR), and two were methicillian susceptible (MS).  You will note that all but 1 didn't have β-lactamase activity, and where <em>more susceptible to penicillin<\/em> than methicillin (ibid).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>BUT<\/em> this does not mean that MR strains are not also penicillin resistant, instead it shows that the resistance can be independent of each other.  Therefore \"A\" is wrong because it tries to draw a correlation that is not there.  In reality many MR strains are also β-lactamase positive.<\/p>\n\n<p>This also address the problem with \"B.\"  While it is possible that a β-lactamase could bind to methicilin and lead to degradation of the antibiotic, <strong>the main mechanism of methicillin resistance is the mutation of PBPs (ibid, 3), in particular BPB2a (4, 5).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We are then left with the task of figuring out why \"C\" is the correct choice.  Indeed \"C\" is the given reason for the failure of \"A\" and \"B,\" but we can still go deeper into how and perhaps why BPB2a mutated.<\/p>\n\n<p>For that I think it is best that we turn back to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC358041/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chambers' review<\/a> of the subject.  Forgive my over quoting, but it's done so well there and the text is now open.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Methicillin resistance is associated with production of a novel PBP\n  that is not present in susceptible staphylococci. Resistant strains of\n  S. aureus produce an additional 78- kilodalton PBP (Fig. 1), termed\n  PBP2a or PBP2' (assumed to be identical for the purposes of this\n  review), that has a low binding affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PBP2a is highly conserved. Limited proteolysis of PBP2a from unrelated\n  strains of S. aureus (123) and coagulasenegative staphylococci (31),\n  whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, generates remarkably similar\n  peptide fragments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Presumably PBP2a can substitute for essential PBPs when these have\n  been saturated by drug and can perform the functions necessary for\n  cell wall assembly (22, 122).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In some strains, PBP2a is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics and its\n  production differs according to growth conditions (34, 122, 125, 159).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, they didn't quite have the staphylococcal cassette chromosome <em>mec<\/em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCCmec\" rel=\"nofollow\">SCCmec<\/a>) figured out at that point.  The genetics is quite complex. <\/p>\n\n<h2>How does MRSA genetically accomplish resistance?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As we already established, the resistance comes from the production of an alternate PBP, PBP2a.  SCCmec is interesting for several reasons.  First of all, it's much larger than a plasmid, and contains information for several genes.  That's why it's called cassette <em>chromosome.<\/em>  Further it normally incorporates into the same part of the genome in staph, in an area know as OrfX (6).  This means that even during horizontal transfer, that the cassette has to direct it's integration into the genome, which is exceedingly uncommon, or at least there are not many other know examples (7, 8).  This cassette can be spread horizontally between staph, and even with other species (ibid, 9).  Even if the integration site (integration site sequence, ISS) is slightly different, this specificity is carried out by cassette chromosome recombinases (ccr), wich are also on SCCmec (8).  This is carried out by ccr-medated recombination of the target chromosome, and further details on the process are considered outside the scope of this question.<\/p>\n\n<p>The actual gene that encodes PBP2a is called <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MecA_%28gene%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">mecA<\/a><\/em>.  But as we mentioned above, PBO2a production can be induced and regulated.  It is likely less favorable to produce it in the absence of antibodies, and after serial passage of bacteria in antibiotic free broth, you find that PBP2a expression can drop drastically.  Therefore regulatory and other useful proteins encoded by SCCmec.  When placed in a β-Lactamase environment, MecR1 causes a single transduction cascade to start transcription of <em>mecA<\/em> (10).  Conversely, MecI provides a negative feedback loop to MecR1, and in the absence of β-Lactamase, will lead to the down regulation of <em>mecA<\/em> (ibid, 11).  The actual action of MecR1 is to cleave MecI, thereby remove the suppression of <em>mecA<\/em> by MecI.  I actually learned something new when reading the wiki on MRSA, but didn't do further research on the subject:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>mecA<\/em> is further controlled by two co-repressors, BlaI and BlaR1. <em>blaI<\/em>\n  and <em>blaR1<\/em> are homologous to <em>mecI<\/em> and <em>mecR1<\/em>, respectively, and normally\n  function as regulators of <em>blaZ<\/em>, which is responsible for penicillin\n  resistance. The DNA sequences bound by MecI and BlaI are\n  identical; therefore, BlaI can also bind the mecA operator to\n  repress transcription of mecA.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This represents the general pattern of resistance of MRSA, but there is a rich diversity in the particulars of how each strain manages expression.  Two of the main identifiers are how the <em>mecA<\/em> gene complex and <em>ccr<\/em> gene complex are configured (carriage).  The other two identifiers are the ISS and whether or not the ISS is repeated in the target chromosome (and how many times it's repeated) (8).  If we just consider the mecA and ccr carriage, then we get a great summary from IWG-SCC (ref 8):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mec gene complex is composed of mecA, its regulatory genes, and\n  associated insertion sequences. The class A mec gene complex (class A\n  mec) is the prototype complex, which contains mecA, the complete mecR1\n  and mecI regulatory genes upstream of mecA, and the hypervariable\n  region (HVR) and insertion sequence IS431 downstream of mecA. The\n  class B mec gene complex is composed of mecA, a truncated mecR1\n  resulting from the insertion of IS1272 upstream of mecA, and HVR and\n  IS431 downstream of mecA. The class C mec gene complex contains mecA\n  and truncated mecR1 by the insertion of IS431 upstream of mecA and HVR\n  and IS431 downstream of mecA. There are two distinct class C mec gene\n  complexes; in the class C1 mec gene complex, the IS431 upstream of\n  mecA has the same orientation as the IS431 downstream of mecA (next to\n  HVR), while in the class C2 mec gene complex, the orientation of IS431\n  upstream of mecA is reversed. C1 and C2 are regarded as different mec\n  gene complexes since they have likely evolved independently. The class\n  D mec gene complex is composed of mecA and ΔmecR1 but does not carry\n  an insertion sequence downstream of ΔmecR1 (as determined by PCR\n  analysis).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ccr gene complex.The ccr gene complex is composed of the ccr gene(s)\n  and surrounding open reading frames (ORFs), several of which have\n  unknown functions. Currently, three phylogenetically distinct ccr\n  genes, ccrA, ccrB, and ccrC, have been identified in S. aureus with\n  DNA sequence similarities below 50% (Fig. 2 and 3). The ccrA and ccrB\n  genes that have been identified to date have been classified into four\n  allotypes. In general, ccr genes with nucleotide identities more than\n  85% are assigned to the same allotype, whereas ccr genes that belong\n  to different allotypes show nucleotide identities between 60% and 82%.\n  All ccrC variants identified to date have shown ≥87% similarity; thus,\n  there is only one ccrC allotype. We suggest describing their\n  differences as alleles by using previously used numbers, e.g., ccrC1\n  allele 2 or ccrC1 allele 8.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this is nicely summarized in <a href=\"http://aac.asm.org/content/53/12/4961/T1.expansion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">their table<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>\\begin{array} {|r|r|r|}\n\\hline\nSCCmec ~type  &amp;ccr ~gene ~complex  &amp;mec ~gene  ~complex \\\\\n\\hline\nI &amp;1 ~(A1B1) &amp;B \\\\\n\\hline\nII &amp;2 ~(A2B2)&amp;A \\\\\n\\hline\nIII &amp;2 ~(A3B3)&amp;A \\\\\n\\hline\nIV &amp;2 ~(A2B2)&amp;B \\\\\n\\hline\nV &amp;5 ~(C)&amp;C2 \\\\\n\\hline\nVI &amp;4 ~(A4B4)&amp;B \\\\\n\\hline\nVII &amp;5 ~(C)&amp;C1 \\\\\n\\hline\nVIII &amp;4 ~(A4B4)&amp;A \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}<\/p>\n\n<h2>To sum up, methicillin-resistance is caused by the encoding of a novel PBP, PBP2a, along with other factors, which is both genetically stable and transferable via the use of SCCmec.<\/h2>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) Pathak A et al.
