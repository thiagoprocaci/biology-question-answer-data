However, apart from appreciating many more details than Darwin ever could have, we also now know that Lamarck may not have been so crazy as he was later portrayed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inheritance in the Darwinian sense involves the digital information of DNA, i.e the sequence of bases. But we also know that DNA can be altered structurally - i.e. in the way it folds, or whether bases are methylated - and that these structural alterations can affect the expression of genes. In some cases, these <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\">epigenetic modifications<\/a> can be trans-generational; they can be passed on to offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the mechanisms that I know of (perhaps others can expand on this):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/x-chromosome-x-inactivation-323\">X-chromosome inactivation<\/a> (XCI): this is when one of two copies of the X-chromosome in females is completely inactivated by being packed into heterochromatin, preventing the DNA from being transcribed. Which chromosome (the maternal or paternal) is deactivated initially is random, but the decision can be inherited by all daughter cells. <em>Skewed<\/em> x-inactivation is when a cell very early in the cell line passes on its XCI decision, and can result in a particular phenotype being activated in a whole organ or tissue (such as patches in tortoiseshell cats). It has been shown that in mice and in humans, the somatic cells can sometimes have their XCI decision influenced by the mother, and that this can lead to early skewing of the XCI in the offspring, thereby passing on a decision about which alleles are present without affecting the DNA sequence.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_imprinting\">Parental imprinting<\/a>: in this case, individual alleles derived from one parent are preferentially activated or deactivated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation\">methylation<\/a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_modification#Chromatin_regulation\">histone modification<\/a>. This change is passed on to the zygote, and alters expression in the offspring. Several human heritable diseases are associated with this kind of modification, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader-Willi_syndrome\">Prader-Willi Syndrome<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramutation\">Paramutation<\/a>: first discovered in maize, this is when the presence of one allele in a genome can affect another allele in a heritable way. I.e. if allele A is present in the same genome as allele B for a single generation, allele A is permanently inactivated so that if you breed out allele B, allele A will not be active in the offspring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Finally, there is also a phenomenon called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inheritance\">structural inheritance<\/a>, whereby a structural feature of an organism is inherited in a non-genetic way. There is less written about this, so the mechanism is not entirely clear as far as I know, but an example is that the 'handedness' of the spiral pattern on the shell of a protozoan <em>Tetrahymena<\/em> is inherited without any genetic change (<a href=\"http://dev.biologists.org/content/105/3/447.long\">Nelsen et al., 1989<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Nelsen, E.M., Frankel, J. &amp; Jenkins, L.M.

In general, we suppose that all DNA sequences from organisms are related by a set of processes. A particularly important process relating DNA sequences is <strong>replication<\/strong>. This establishes a parent-child relationship between DNA sequences in one round of <strong>replication<\/strong> or an ancestor-descendent relationship when we view more than one round of replication.<\/p>\n\n<p>For simplicity, consider a single bacterial cell, which replicates its genome and divides, yielding a descendent cell. This process continues for each cell and produces a population of cells over time. This population of cells (and their genomes) are related to each other by this process of replication and division. The structure of this relationship is a tree (in the mathematical sense). The vertices of the tree are the DNA sequences (or cells) and a directed edge from <code>vertex i<\/code> to <code>vertex j<\/code> exists if and only if the sequence represented by <code>vertex j<\/code> is the result of a replication of the sequence represented by <code>vertex i<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the replication process which makes this tree structure relating sequences, there are mutational processes that lead to sequence differences.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many ways for mutations to arise before or during DNA replication. The important thing to note is that these mutations are passed on to descendants. So, a cell is either genetically identical to its parent cell, or it contains some number of mutations (insertions, deletions, or polymorphisms in the DNA) with respect to its parent.<\/p>\n\n<p>These mutations (sequence differences) are inherited during replication, and you can think of them as \"occurring\" along a given edge in the tree from a parent cell to a child cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if you consider any two DNA sequences, as well as the model just given, these two sequences are related through the replication-mutation process (the tree). If the DNA sequences are not identical, you have many ways to interpret this question of what is a mutation. It is useful to consider the most recent common ancestor of the two DNA sequences in making sense of the differences observed in the DNA. If you think of the genealogy as a tree, and you're considering two vertices in the tree, then tracing backwards towards the root of the tree from each vertex, these traces will eventually meet at another vertex. The first vertex at which they meet is the most recent common ancestor.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is possible that mutations have occurred along both paths from the (most recent) common ancestor to the descendent sequences you're investigating. If you're investigating N sequences, there are N paths from the common ancestor on which mutations may have occurred.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of this is to say that mutations occur with respect to this genealogical process. If you just consider 2, or N, sequences without regard to the process that generated them, then it can be meaningless or confusing to consider a particular sequence difference as a <em>mutation<\/em> with respect to another sequence under consideration. For example, if you observe a single nucleotide polymorphism between two sequences, how would you know which sequence was the result of the mutation? It is possible that one or both sequences carries a mutation event in its genealogical history since the common ancestor of both sequences.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29870,"question_id":29868,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1424757888}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29868/what-do-we-use-as-baseline-to-determine-what-genetic-segments-are-mutations-a","last_activity_date":1458697601,"creation_date":1424753366,"answer_count":1,"title":"What do we use as baseline to determine what genetic segments are \"mutations\" (and what are not)","body":"<p>In order to determine whether a particular segment of the genome is a mutation, there must first be a baseline code on which that code looks somehow different.<\/p>\n\n<p>How has the baseline genome been determined?

So its not exactly true that everyone has a unique genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>But to get at the heart of it, you're asking how I can be sure that I have a different genome than you, or even than say my brother. And moreover you're asking how these differences are obvious enough that they can be detected <em>without<\/em> whole genome sequencing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer is that there is no mechanism to ensure differences, but that the differences arise from the enormous variability of our genome. Look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex\" rel=\"nofollow\">major histocompatibility complex<\/a>, or <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27156/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MHC<\/a>, a cluster of genes that affect our immune system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just to simplify things, lets focus in on four genes in this cluster: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. According to <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/stats.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site<\/a> there are 2579, 3285, 2133 and 1411 alleles for each, respectively. If we make a naive assumption that each of us received a random assortment of these genes, that makes 2579 x 3285 x 2133 x 1411 = 25,549,791,000,000 possible combinations. The chance that we both have the same combination is then about 1 in 25 trillion, just considering 4 genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>But wait, you say, surely some of these genes are not equally likely and surely they segregate together, making this chance much smaller. You would be right. But this consideration stops mattering very much when you account for the rest of the variable regions. They combine multiplicatively, so considering a fifth gene with only 2 possible alleles brings the possible combinations to 50 trillion.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you consider just a few more genes, the numbers get unthinkably high.

The sleepiness is caused both by the mild CO2 toxicity and the lack of O2 to your brain and muscles.

Assuming you sleep for 8 hours you would only need 0.2 kg of O2 (0.6kg/24hr is needed for the avg. person at rest). If your room was the size of a twin bed (hypothetically) there would be around 0.15kg of O2.

The actual wikipedia page for genetic dominance provides a good section:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By definition, the terms dominant and recessive refer to the genotypic interaction of alleles in producing the phenotype of the heterozygote. The key concept is genetic: Which of the two alleles present in the heterozygote is expressed, such that the organism is phenotypically identical to one of the two homozygotes. It is sometimes convenient to talk about the trait corresponding to the dominant allele as the dominant trait, and the trait corresponding to the hidden allele as the recessive trait. However, this can easily lead to confusion in understanding the concept as phenotypic. For example, to say that \"green peas\" dominate \"yellow peas\" confuses inherited genotypes and expressed phenotypes, and will subsequently confuse discussion of the molecular basis of the phenotypic difference.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good place to start: Wikipedia<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>What you should also note is that dominance isn't intrinsic to the allele.

The <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/14700/how-long-is-a-day-on-earth/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>solar day<\/em><\/a> is 24 hours and is defined by the time it takes the sun to make an apparent circuit across the skies. More importantly, there is <strong>apparent solar time<\/strong>, sometimes called <strong>true solar time<\/strong>, which is determined by the daily apparent motion of the observed sun. It is based on the interval between two successive returns of the sun to the local meridian. The length of a solar day varies throughout the year, and the accumulated effect of these variations (equation of time) produces seasonal deviations of up to <strong>16 minutes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall12/atmo336/lectures/sec4/seasons.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">length of a day<\/a> can also be defined in the <strong>number or hours from sunrise to sunset<\/strong>, which varies where you are on earth.

The fundamental idea is that RNAi is directed against one of the vital genes of this nematode. Since, RNAi causes downregulation of the target gene, the nematode dies (or becomes ineffective in infecting) because of the loss of function of these important genes. As you might know about the process of RNAi, dsRNA (or hairpins) are cleaved by Dicer and the small single stranded RNA products, called siRNAs, associate with Argonaute proteins to form RISC (RNA induced silencing complex). The RISC will cleave RNAs complementary to the siRNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you see any of these articles you will notice that the dsRNA is not injected into the nematode; it is expressed in the plant. Nematodes (such as this one and <em>C.elegans<\/em> in which it is quite well studied) can take up dsRNA from the environment via the RNA transporters present in their cell membranes (See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/23534/3340\">this post<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, coming to your question on <em>\"Why do RNAi pathway proteins exist in the nematode when they can cause them harm?\"<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>endo-siRNA and miRNA mediated silencing pathways have critical roles in the nematode development and other miscellaneous functions (See <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205135/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this review<\/a>). As you already know, RNAi can also serve as a defence against dsRNA viruses. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is us, humans, who have exploited this pathway to develop tools for molecular biology and for targeting parasitic organisms. There is certainly a likelihood that the host plant may express the dsRNA against the nematode during the course of the evolution of its anti-parasitic defence system (it is however not the case now).

The Apicoplast is involved in biosynthetic pathways but the precise importance of it remains unknown.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mitochondrion is a very different organelle and has a different evolutionary origin. Mitochondria, like Chloroplasts, produce ATP from an electron transport chain but use chemical substrates (NADH, flavin etc) rather than light as a source of initial energy. Mitochondria are thought to be an outcome of an endosymbiosis between an ancestral eukaryotic cell and an $\\alpha$-proteobacterium. Chloroplasts, on the other hand have descended from a Cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Therefore the structure of mitochondria is very different from that of chloroplasts. <\/p>\n\n<p>Chromoplasts, leukoplasts, amyloplasts and apicoplasts have lost the photosynthetic ability. Similarly, there are variants of mitochondria which use different electron acceptors (other than oxygen) and some are just incapable of ATP synthesis. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are there any plant sequence database for each of them (plastid,\n  chloroplast and mitochondira)?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Chloroplast genome database: <a href=\"http://chloroplast.cbio.psu.edu/\">{link}<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know of a separate plant mitochondrial database but you can see this resource called <a href=\"http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/1/128.full\">MitBASE<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>NCBI also has the organellar DNA sequences. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can we separate as chloroplast, mitochondria, platid sequence from\n  whole genome assembly?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Usually the organellar genomes will assemble as separate contigs when you sequence from the whole cell DNA prep.

Such small differences can have important impact on the development of the fetus.<\/p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/why-is-a-heritability-coefficient-not-an-index-of-how-genetic-something-is\">this post on heritability<\/a> to have a better understanding of the underlying environmental variation explaining phenotypic variation in populations.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But they are clone for life, right?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Well, it depends on the exact definition of clone but it is important to understand that the expression of genes varies a lot in response to the environment.

The smaller the aperture, the sharper the picture. But because there is only a small amount of light falling through the pinhole, the image will be quite dark. Besides, the displayed area of the image is very limited.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/s5Z36.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/s5Z36.png\" alt=\"Pinhole eye of an ormer\"><\/a><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ozVhR.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ozVhR.png\" alt=\"A Roman snail&#39;s simple lens eye\"><\/a>\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MN9mZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MN9mZ.png\" alt=\"A limpet&#39;s cup shaped eye.   \"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>From left to right:<\/strong> Pinhole eye of an ormer, A Roman snail's simple lens eye, A limpet's cup shaped eye<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Could a blind snail survive?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>There are even some types of gastropods which are naturally born blind such as: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cecilioides acicula, common name the \"blind snail\" or \"blind awlsnail\", is a species of very small, air-breathing land snail, a pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Ferussaciidae.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Descriptive features:<\/em><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This animal is white, there are two pairs of tentacles, but eyes are lacking. <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MN9mZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>\n  The shell is long and narrow, up to a maximum of 5.5 mm and a width of 1.2 mm.<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/018T8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a> The shell is colorless, glassy and transparent when it is fresh, a somewhat opaque milky-white when it is not fresh.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Snails which are visually impaired are not limited in their ability to move, however, and can easily navigate their habitats through their sense of touch and smell.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/018T8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/018T8.png\" alt=\"Cecilioides acicula\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the ethics of your \"investigation\", I'd recommend to just not do it. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sources:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindschnecke\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindschnecke<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/home/species?id=1286\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/home/species?id=1286<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilioides\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilioides<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html?/gastropoda/morphology/eyes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html?/gastropoda/morphology/eyes.html<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":44467,"question_id":44458,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1458550037}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44458/what-happens-to-a-snail-if-we-cut-off-its-antennae","last_activity_date":1458550448,"creation_date":1458511988,"answer_count":1,"title":"What happens to a snail if we cut off its antennae?","body":"<p>First off, I don't know why snails have antennas.

Additionally, it explores some basic explanations of the process, if you are interested. If a woman has doubts about her fertility in 10 years time (using your final sentence as an example), such as if she is recently diagnosed with cancer, or needs to finish education but is ready to be committed to having a baby in more than 9 months' time, then she may decide to freeze her eggs for a time when she is more suited to have a baby, using a time when her <em>body<\/em> is more suited to producing eggs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Does Freezing Have Adverse Effects?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As for your second question, the same page does mention successfully freezing an embryo for 10 years at -196 degrees Celsius, with no adverse effects on the eventual birth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regardless, exploring the risks reveals that the decision on whether the practice is seen as positive or negative is still on the fence - different parties argue for different opinions, as there appears to be no objective truth about proven adverse affects. <\/p>\n\n<p>The risks described by <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/egg-freezing/details/risks/cmc-20168999\" rel=\"nofollow\">this clinic<\/a> are worth considering, albeit minimal compared to a risk of malformed children, however, it is still a popular choice, albeit put forward as 'experimental'. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028210008009\" rel=\"nofollow\">This study<\/a> (2010, Rudick et al) showed how, in the US, cryopreservation was already being offered in 283 of 442 fertility clinics surveyed. 1/3 of the reasons for the choice was for women with cancer, and the other 2/3 was for women with 'advancing maternal age'.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), in 2013, stated that they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463693\" rel=\"nofollow\">do not endorse freezing of eggs<\/a> '<em>for the sole purpose of circumventing reproductive aging in healthy women<\/em>', however, the ASRM (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) lifted its label as being 'experimental' in <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/19/health/egg-freezing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2012<\/a>. The previously linked article describes a study conducted by the ASRM, which <em>'reviewed data from four randomized controlled trials and various observational studies that compared fertilization rates, embryo implantation rates and pregnancy rates of fresh eggs versus eggs that were frozen'<\/em>, and '<em>showed no increase in birth defects, developmental disorders or chromosomal abnormalities when in vitro fertilization cycles were conducted with frozen eggs, leading the society to declare the technique effective and safe<\/em>'.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p>Your question is a slightly broad one, and can be answered by the subjective choice of the woman/women involved, however the ASRM still stresses that \"<em>we should proceed cautiously in using this as an elective technique<\/em>\", by making a clear line between 'need' and 'want'. However, there is no evidence to show that rates of abnormality are any higher using this method, but considering it is still a fairly new practice that is being marketed as a choice rather than a medical treatment, there is skepticism in the air around whether marketing scientific and medical designs as a mere 'choice' for older women will lead to this technology becoming better or worse.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, about your comment of it being 'less expensive', <a href=\"http://www.advancedfertility.com/fertility-treatment-costs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website<\/a> shows that the average cost of in vitro fertilization in the U.S. is currently about 10,000 - 20,000 USD, whereas the first website I linked (<a href=\"http://uscfertility.org/egg-freezing-faqs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>) estimates the cost at about 10,000 USD to undergo an egg freezing cycle. Although, the prices will change from clinic to clinic. Regardless, the prices are still similar, and the choice lies in the woman choosing to pay and freeze her eggs if, for example, she has recently been diagnosed with cancer, or fears she will not be fertile in 5+ years time.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this answer has been sufficient in answering your questions, and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://uscfertility.org/egg-freezing-faqs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://uscfertility.org/egg-freezing-faqs/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/egg-\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/egg-<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028210008009\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028210008009<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463693\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463693<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/19/health/egg-freezing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/19/health/egg-freezing/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.advancedfertility.com/fertility-treatment-costs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.advancedfertility.com/fertility-treatment-costs.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":44462,"question_id":44461,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44461/whats-the-rationale-behind-freezing-ones-eggs-if-cells-can-be-cloned","last_activity_date":1458522836,"creation_date":1458519519,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's the rationale behind freezing one's eggs if cells can be cloned?","body":"<p>It seems to me there's a lot of discussions around the topic of somebody freezing her eggs.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand though are the following:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why would you freeze your eggs when you know that the technology for transforming a somatic cell into an egg today exists, or doesn't it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete#Artificial_gametes\" rel=\"nofollow\">see here<\/a>?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Is it proven that freezing doesn't alter biological activity and hence not diminish the chance of giving birth to a malformed child?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>To me it seems way easier and safer (and less expensive) to artificially produce female gametes than freezing them and, 10 years later, unfreeze and hope for them to be still biologically active.<\/p>\n","question_id":44461,"tags":["biotechnology","cloning","eggs","sexual-reproduction"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1458519821},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef3e797a6cc5982ce0e52fc051585c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22515,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22515/raj","reputation":6,"display_name":"Raj"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DFoyP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22631,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22631/butallati","reputation":134,"display_name":"Butallati"},"score":0,"post_id":44452,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458520195,"comment_id":77419,"body":"What do you qualify as &#39;artificial&#39;?

When these two groups are changed into a single O joining two α monomers into starch, they have to remain in the same position.  When a single O joins them together, that oxygen requires the angle between the bond be less than 180 degrees, so the two glucoses have to be on one side of the oxygen.  That's fine in the drawing because in α glucose both OH groups are pointing down.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in β-glucose the OH groups of carbons 1 and 4 are on opposite sides of the glucose ring. Joining two β monomers to make cellulose requires that these two OH groups point in the same direction so that when changed into bonds to the single O, the angle which the oxygen requires can be provided.  To get the two OH groups pointing the same way requires one of the two β-glucoses to flip relative to the other.

For example, you may find the same sequence to code for a protein in a mouse as in a human, but they will not be found in the same place along the DNA code (although they will still be read and eventually produce the same protein).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6915/full/nature01262.html\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6915/full/nature01262.html<\/a>\nAdditionally, this article shows that, if we take your question literally, \"at the nucleotide level, approximately 40% of the human genome can be aligned to the mouse genome\", that is, if human and mouse DNA was lined up side-by-side, and a percentage of <em>identical<\/em> match-ups was calculated.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, taking a 'looser' approach, it is worth noting that about 5 percent of both of genomes consist of protein-coding genes (<a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/10001345\">https://www.genome.gov/10001345<\/a>), and the remaining 90%+ is non-coding.

So why do we like it?<\/p>\n\n<p>A study was actually conducted on the subject and answers most of your questions. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666313003930#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here the reference<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The temperature of the body will indeed not change<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>cold stimuli applied to the mouth\n  (internal surface of the body) do not appear to impact on body\n  temperature and are not reported to cause any reflex shivering\n  or skin vasoconstriction that influence body temperature.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As you pointed out, the temperature of the ingested water will <strong>not affect the overall hydration of the body<\/strong> as cells are rehydrated mostly via the blood  stream and the blood temperature will not be affected. Someone could argue that, at identical volumes, cold water (above 4C) contains more molecules (i.e. is denser) than warm water but this difference is likely very slim.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this paper they also define \"thirst\".<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thirst is a homeostatic mechanism that regulates blood osmolarity\n  by initiating water intake when blood osmolarity increases<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is that it takes some time before the water reaches the blood stream, and therefore you need a feedback mechanism that tells you to stop drinking independently of the blood's osmolarity. This is where cold might play a role.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The cold stimulus to the mouth from ingestion of water may act\n  as a satiety signal to meter water intake and prevent excessive\n  ingestion of water<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The picture would then be the following\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BgAON.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In essence, a cold sensation is pleasant in warm weather, both on the skin and in the mouth, and it apparently helps in reducing thirst by being some kind of an  enhancer of the \"water intake flow meter\".<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Footnote<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Reading the comments I just want to clarify some points.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 5 basic tastes (sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami) are very distinct from taste sensations (pungency, smoothness, cooling to name a few). The main difference is that taste and \"sensation\" signals use completely different paths to reach the brain - namely, the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves for the former and the trigeminal nerve for the latter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is the temperature affecting basic taste perceptions? The answer is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/nature04248.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">yes<\/a>. How this happens is quite simple if you understand the fundamental concepts of molecular taste perception. Essentially the temperature affects the response of the receptor TRPM5 which is the main player in depolarizing taste receptor cells in the papillae. To put it simply, higher temperatures provoke a greater perception for taste, and this is not only in term of perceived taste but really modifies the amplitude of the response at the molecular level. As an example this is why ice cream does not taste sweet when frozen but only after it melted in the mouth or on the tongue.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30657,"question_id":6915,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1458430497},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1427064332,"creation_date":1427064332,"body":"<p>The organism as a thermodynamic machine does need a coolant.

The pragmatic biology answer is there is no problem. This is such a well established algorithm that the implementation on any reputable site or from any reputable provider is likely to be OK. No heuristic is involved so if you compare different implementations you should get similar answers. I say similar rather than identical because there may be more than one alignment with the same score but only one is selected. Generally it makes no difference. <\/p>\n\n<p>I suppose there is one aspect of the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm that could differ between implementations, but it is one for which you, the user, will have the ultimate responsibility \u2014 the scoring system. Your basic assumption is that two sequences are related, and you are asking the program to give you the pairwise alignment that  \u2018best\u2019 expresses that relatedness. \u2018Best\u2019 in the program translates into the highest score on a system that assigns a different value to the alignment of different pairs of all 20 amino acids (a comparison matrix for proteins) and specific penalties for the introduction of a gap (to allow for an insertion or deletion) and the extension of a gap once introduced. The implementations offer default values (I imagine these are similar in most programs) but its up to you to decide whether they are appropriate for the sequences that you are comparing, and to change them if necessary. <\/p>\n\n<p>What are your options and when might it be necessary to exercise them? You can choose from different comparison matrices derived from aligning blocks of sequences for the same protein in organisms of different evolutionary separation. These matrices differ because some amino acid changes require only a single base change in the codon, whereas others require changes at all three positions of a codon,. The latter are less likely to occur over short evolutionary time spans (e.g. between mouse and rat) than at longer ones (e.g. between mouse and bacterium). So ideally you should employ the comparison matrix most appropriate to the sequences you are comparing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Circumstances where you might wish to change the gap penalties or even customize the comparison tables are, admittedly, esoteric, but I would advise that it is better to think about the applicability of the scoring system to your biological problem than to worry that someone might have made a hash of implementing the computer algorithm.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44415,"question_id":44413,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1458410483}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44413/how-to-compare-smith-waterman-algorithm-implementations","last_activity_date":1458410483,"creation_date":1458333752,"answer_count":2,"title":"how to compare Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm implementations?","body":"<p>Assume that you have two softwares of smith waterman algorithm (with what ever heuristic they apply to speed up) for local sequence alignment of genomic sequences. <\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if for sure these softwares do a good job of aligning (i.e the program has been correctly written), how do I benchmark this?<\/p>\n","question_id":44413,"tags":["bioinformatics","dna-sequencing","sequence-alignment"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1458334525},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a73ebf6ae099e1ffce5b17d8a8cdde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22645,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22645/eleceng2016","reputation":16,"display_name":"ElecEng2016"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":44421,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458366766,"comment_id":77341,"body":"Welcome to Biology.SE.

The antigens on the surface of these special white blood cells determine the genetic make-up of a person's immune system. There are at least 100 HLA antigens; however, it is believed that there are a few major antigens that determine whether a donor and recipient match. The others are considered minor and their effect on a successful transplant is not as well defined.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Medical research is still investigating the role all antigens play in the process of a bone marrow transplant. The more antigens that match, the better the engraftment of donated marrow.

The danger of mixing two antagonistic blood types <em>in vivo<\/em> is that the recipient's immune system attacks the foreign red blood cells resulting in body-wide rejection. However, because the immune system's response capabilities are decimated by the destruction of the recipient's bone marrow (usually accomplished via chemotherapy or radiation), it can't mount much of an attack in the first place. That's not to say the body can't mount an attack, or that the donor's tissue can't mount an attack on the recipient (Graft-Versus-Host-Disease [GVHD]) - but the better the HLA match the less likely issues are to arise, which is why we do the more accurate and relevant HLA matching instead of blood-typing.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5276,"question_id":5274,"up_vote_count":12}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5274/will-a-bone-marrow-transplant-change-ones-blood-type","last_activity_date":1458321702,"creation_date":1353426055,"answer_count":1,"title":"Will a bone marrow transplant change one's blood type?","body":"<p>Will a bone marrow transplant change one's blood type?<\/p>\n\n<p>Or is the donor blood type matched with the person before transplant?<\/p>\n","question_id":5274,"tags":["human-biology","human-genetics"],"score":10,"accepted_answer_id":5276,"down_vote_count":0,"protected_date":1458328672,"is_answered":true,"view_count":12229,"up_vote_count":10},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1066825917/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":4032,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4032/bryan","reputation":6,"display_name":"Bryan"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":2,"post_id":16450,"edited":false,"creation_date":1397074670,"comment_id":22191,"body":"For those that don&#39;t know about it, could you expand a little on what MZ discordance is and what it means for a disease?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1066825917/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":4032,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4032/bryan","reputation":6,"display_name":"Bryan"},"score":0,"post_id":16450,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"edited":false,"creation_date":1397501547,"comment_id":22343,"body":"MZ discordance is when MZ twins do not have the same phenotype.

Allele is defined, in simple terms, variation of a given gene, e.g. through deletions, SNPs etc. Humans are diploid organisms, meaning we have two sets of chromosomes, one from mother and one from father. Now since we have two sister chromosome, we can only have (share) two alleles of a given gene (one from mother and one from father) unless there are multiple copies of a gene or chromosome, which is mostly observed in disease conditions but that's not what we are talking about. Now since every humans have SNPs at roughly 1 every 1000 base pair, there are genetic variations between sequences of genes between humans, although there are some hot spots, which are more varied and some genes are very highly conserved due to their critical function such as cytochrome C. This just means that parents of the child you are describing (if not related to each other) are not likely to share the exact same, sequence wise, genetic code for a given gene selected at random.<\/p>\n\n<p>The inheritance of a given allele of a gene on a chromosome happens through independent assortment (a process which happens maternally and paternally), meaning a child (offspring/zygote) would get one copy of a gene/allele (from the possible two that each parent themselves have) from maternal and one copy from paternal side at random. This is one source of genetic variation in a zygote. The other source of genetic variation is gene cross-over (through homologous recombination) meaning bits of the maternal or paternal chromosomes swap at gamete stage before the gametes are fused together to form a zygote, which makes the offspring unique and no offspring alike (except MZ twins but thats another discussion). This overall means that you can inherit a maximum of two alleles of a given gene (assuming again the parents of the child are not closely related) and even then the sequence of the offspring genes are not likely to be exactly the same as their parents, which makes every human unique. But saying that, you have a much higher gene sequence match to your parents than any other non-related human selected at random.<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing worth noting here is that mitochondrial genes, are inherited exclusively from you mother (through the egg) and males inherit the Y chromosomes paternally so there are circumstances I guess you could say you inherit certain gene/alleles paternally or maternally.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I speculate you might be thinking about is how many homologues (similar versions) of a given genes humans have and I think the average in the human genome is 3 but do check this! Flies (Drosophila) tends to have one, which is why its such a great model organism to study genetics and genetic interactions with as you do not tend to get redundancies.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question<\/p>\n","answer_id":17292,"question_id":10474,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1400285475}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10474/on-average-how-many-genes-alleles-do-people-share","last_activity_date":1458309171,"creation_date":1379425581,"answer_count":1,"title":"On average how many genes / alleles do people share?","body":"<p>I am curious about how much more a child can be alike to one parent than the other.

Here I am talking generally since no specific studies exist in ATP vs other candidates. <\/p>\n\n<p>A lot of the below information is taken from a relatively old article mentioned in the comments by TomD that discusses: <em>\"Why nature chose phosphates.\"<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2434996\" rel=\"nofollow\">by Westheimer, 1987<\/a>. The article is very influential and has been cited over a thousand times since publication. I've decided to make a revision to my original answer upon discovering another article that came out in the same year that this question was asked <em>\"Why nature<\/em> <strong><em>really<\/em><\/strong> <em>chose phosphate.\"<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23318152\" rel=\"nofollow\">by Kamerlin <em>et al.,<\/em> 2013<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the below arguments are more convincing than others.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Summary.<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatives may not provide enough energy.<\/li>\n<li>Alternatives may be toxic.<\/li>\n<li>Others are used for inefficient high energy bursts. <\/li>\n<li>ATP has ancestral dominance.<\/li>\n<li>Pi is a good leaving group.<\/li>\n<li>Phosphates are fundamentally regulatable through electrostatic manipulation.<\/li>\n<li>ATP synthase can efficiently reattach the Pi to ADP.<\/li>\n<li>Lots of Pi available to organisms. *(Although as @Roland points out in the comments, this is a circular argument. One could call it a circular effect though.)<\/li>\n<li>ATP can provide more energy if needed. (ADP becomes AMP + Pi)<\/li>\n<li>Easily useable by a variety of proteins.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>Why ATP?<\/h1>\n\n<p>ATP is an efficient and relatively simply biosynthesised molecule that can fulfil multiple biochemical roles. Cells do have alternative energy carriers, some with more specialised roles, however ATP is ubiquitous throughout our cells and intercellular spaces. There isn't a wealth of resources explaining why ATP is any better than other compounds, however there is plenty of reasons why the phosphates are required.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Why not the alternatives?<\/h1>\n\n<p>Citric acids and their derivatives are a good candidate, with deductible groups and high bioavailability but they simply don't give enough energy to stabilize genetic material. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another tribasic candidate is arsenic acid. This is a fundamentally toxic compound though, which isn't particularly great for living things. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are other phosphates too, and they are used in many organisms. But they have specific functions, and not used as the general energy carrier. For example creatine triphosphate provides a high energy phosphoanhydride bond, that is often used to quickly and anaerobically regenerate ATP, useful during high rate muscle activity for contraction. <\/p>\n\n<p>GTP is structurally very similar to ATP. GTPases are used more to initiate cellular signalling pathways. It is is sometimes used as an energy source. This is a good example of an alternative energy carrier. <\/p>\n\n<p>Over the years, many proteins have specialised with a specific shape, and this chance is the primary reason behind ATP over GTP. In other words, the choice of ATP over GTP is primarily down to cellular preference of molecular shape. One of them had to emerge as being more widely used, and it was ATP that 'won'.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Efficiency and simplicity.<\/h1>\n\n<p>The reaction was once thought to be a relatively simple nucleophilic displacement. From the 2013 paper: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...this simplicity is deceptive, as, even in aqueous solution, the low-lying d-orbitals on the phosphorus atom allow for eight distinct mechanistic possibilities, before even introducing the complexities of the enzyme catalyzed reactions. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Traditionally one will be taught that ATP is such a chemically efficient way of storing and transporting energy. This is due to the ATP->ADP &amp; Pi hydrolysis reaction. The phosphate groups in ATP are full of negative charges and these are repelling one another. This means that the third phosphate is <strong>a great leaving group<\/strong> and breaking the phosphoanhydride bond is a favorable reaction. ...<\/p>\n\n<p><em>...But<\/em> the story is a lot more complicated than that. The above explanation isn't really satisfying because those same negative charge forces are repulsive of the nucleophile that is attempting to complete ATP->ADP &amp; Pi. A more comprehensive explanation would go along the lines of: although a negative charge repulsion exists between the nucleophile of the protein and the phosphate, that high energy barrier can be overcome by electrostatic manipulation. This allows an \"on-off switch\" for the hydrolytic reaction by tweaking the electrostatic environment. This is another great regulatory tool that the phosphates provide. This regulatory feature is important for signal and metabolic/catabolic cascades.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to 'rebinding' the Pi to ADP, it is fairly easy since ADP seldom covalently binds to anything, which would require a lot of energy to recover the ADP. This also helps the bioavailability of free ADP to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y1dO4nNaKY\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATP synthase<\/a>, an incredibly efficient enzyme, that uses membrane proton gradient to drive the production of ATP. Talking about actual numbers is difficult here as there is only data available from Rat hepatocytes. Who is to say mammals are representative of all organisms? The estimates of energy of hydrolysis range from  <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/better-biochemistry-free-energy-of-atp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ΔG˚ = -48 kJ mol-1<\/a> to <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/576/how-on-a-physical-level-does-atp-confer-energy?rq=1\">-30.5 kmol-1<\/a>. Note that these are considerable, but not exceptional values, so it's easy for many different proteins, that need not be very specialised, to break the bond all over the body. I couldn't even find the numbers for the synthase reaction per ATP, but a single ATP synthase can produce up to 600 ATP per minute.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final point of this efficiency is that the elements in ATP are very abundant in the biosphere making it easily available. This is ultimately what makes the phosphates a great biomolecule.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Multifunctionality.<\/h1>\n\n<p>ATP is ubiquitous in the body, but in some cases more energy is needed than there are ATP available. In these times of need, ATP can be used to produce more energy, breaking another phosphoanhydride bond to become AMP+2Pi. AMP however is typically a signalling molecule.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the low activation energy required to break the phosphoanhydride bond, a multitude of enzymes, far too many to list here, can make use of ATP in order to gain energy towards the activation energy for many other functions. <\/p>\n","answer_id":14044,"question_id":11286,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1455608125}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11286/why-is-atp-the-preferred-choice-for-energy-carriers","last_activity_date":1458277929,"creation_date":1383553357,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is ATP the preferred choice for energy carriers?","body":"<p>Why is ATP the most prevalent form of chemical energy storage and utilization in most cells?<\/p>\n","question_id":11286,"tags":["biochemistry","molecular-biology","cell-biology"],"score":12,"accepted_answer_id":14044,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14945,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1387377158},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0H3k6.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22488,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22488/rosesunhill","reputation":104,"display_name":"rosesunhill"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"post_id":44387,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458278304,"comment_id":77284,"body":"First of all you should understand how exactly a brain works.

A wave of negative charge on the surface of an axon marks the position, at any moment, of the action potential. Action potentials are self-generated along the axon. The events that set up an action potential at one spot on the nerve fibre also transmit it along the entire length of the nerve fibre. The changes in membrane permeability at one site upset the normal membrane permeability at the adjacent area. The action potential then moves to the neighbouring region of the nerve fibre till it covers the whole length of the fibre. Action potential is propagated along a nerve fibre without any change in the amplitude. It is, thus, a nondecremental (not decreasing) phenomenon. Actually, it would be better to say that action potential does not travel but is regenerated anew in a sequence along the axon.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation-<\/strong> To know why nerve impulse transmission is consistent, lets first know how it is transmitted, for which we should know how it is generated.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation-<\/strong>\nAt rest (no impulse), outside of neuron i.e. ECF (extra-cellular fluid) has more positive charge and inside of neuron has relatively less positive charge or more negative charge. This is maintained by keeping Na<sup>+<\/sup> outside and allowing K<sup>+<\/sup> to move freely between inside outside. It is done by action of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel\" rel=\"nofollow\">voltage-gated ion channels<\/a> like closing of Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels and keeping K<sup>+<\/sup> channels open, and through Na<sup>+<\/sup>/K<sup>+<\/sup> ATPase which transports 3 Na<sup>+<\/sup> outside for bringing 2 K<sup>+<\/sup> inside, and K<sup>+<\/sup> can again freely move outside down the concentration gradient. This results in a <strong>resting membrane potential<\/strong> of -70mV i.e. <strong>depolarization<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>When neuron receives a stimulus, its Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels open and K<sup>+<\/sup> channels close which causes an influx of Na<sup>+<\/sup> which results in more positive charge inside and negative charge outside. This is the <strong>action potential<\/strong> of neuron of about +30mV (value varies, I have taken from <a href=\"http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/301notes2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>, for variations in AP see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>). It lasts for less than 1/1000 of a second as Na<sup>+<\/sup>/K<sup>+<\/sup> pump  starts working again immediately and K<sup>+<\/sup> channels open and Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels close again to recover the resting potential of neuron i.e. <strong>repolarization<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/raKlO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/raKlO.jpg\" alt=\"nerve impulse generation\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-2-detecting-and-respond/coordination--regulation/nervous-system.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Transmission-<\/strong>\nBreaking of resting potential i.e. action potential at one place stimulates action potential at the adjacent place. Actually, action potential is not transmitted through the neuron, it is regenerated at adjacent areas in a sequential manner from one point to another in the axon. Opening &amp; closing of ion channels at one point causes opening &amp; closing of ion channels at the next point by which action potential is transmitted through the axon.\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1yfVt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1yfVt.jpg\" alt=\"nerve impulse transmission\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mun.ca/biology/desmid/brian/BIOL2060/BIOL2060-13/CB13.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>\nThis also explains why nerve impulse does not travel in reverse direction i.e. due to repolarization state of neuron at the previous site during which it cannot transmit any impulse.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/81zzc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/81zzc.jpg\" alt=\"nerve impulse consistency\"><\/a>\n<a href=\"https://universe-review.ca/R10-11-gradient01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for why nerve impulse is consistent through the neuron i.e. why it does not decrease during its course through axon. This is because of equal charge throughout the length of axon. Resting potential is -70mV throughout the axon, and action potential is +30mV at any point in the axon, due to which no charge is dissipated and the nerve impulse remains consistent. For detail about it, refer to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-none_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">all or none law of nerve impulse<\/a> which states:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The all-or-none law is the principle that the strength by which a nerve or muscle fiber responds to a stimulus is independent of the strength of the stimulus. If that stimulus exceeds the threshold potential, the nerve or muscle fiber will give a complete response; otherwise, there is no response.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. if a stimulus has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">threshold potential<\/a> (-40mV to -55mV), it will always generate nerve impulse of same action potential (+30mV) otherwise no action potential will be generated and transmitted i.e. it will be consistent everywhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source- Pradeep's : A textbook of Biology for Class XI, chapter 22- Neural control and coordination.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similar answer has been posted by @Thawn too. I have added some more explanation and citation to this answer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 1-<\/strong> You may find an answer to <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31069/how-does-a-change-in-the-potential-across-a-neurons-membrane-get-turned-into-a\">How does a change in the potential across a neuron&#39;s membrane get turned into a signal that is sent down the axon?<\/a> helpful which says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the sodium gates open the more positive the voltage is, which in turn opens more sodium gates. If a patch of neural membrane is depolarized, the charge diffuses into the nearby patches of neural membrane. This will open the sodium channels of the nearby membrane patch. Now once enough sodium channels open, the neuron will fire a action potential, at this point potassium channels open and potassium rushes out of the cell repolarizing it(making it more negative). Furthermore the sodium gates close at positive voltages which further repolarizes the neuron and prevents back propagation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlgeT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlgeT.jpg\" alt=\"transmission of nerve impulse, link from another question\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2-<\/strong> Thus propagation of ions in axon can be, as pointed out by @Thawn, categorised as:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Perpendicular to length-<\/strong> this type of movement is responsible for generation of action potential. It is perpendicular to length of axon i.e. through neuron's membrane. This type of movement of ions is governed by voltage-gated ion channels, which ensure charge difference between inside and outside of axon.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Along the length-<\/strong> this type of movement is responsible for transmission of nerve impulse through the axon. It is parallel to length of axon. Since there is no membrane in length of axon, this type of movement is thus governed only by diffusion. As Na+ enters cytoplasm of axon, it diffuses to adjacent areas. But since previous (depolarized) area already has high concentration of Na+, so its net movement is towards the next (polarized) area, which becomes the cause for depolarization of that area. This is similar for K+, Cl- and other ions (like protein-derived anions).<\/p>\n","answer_id":44155,"question_id":44154,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1458230134},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa7f3890596ea15dcb499602b5e1aa34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":21218,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/21218/thawn","reputation":421,"display_name":"Thawn"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":44165,"edited":false,"creation_date":1457639762,"comment_id":76728,"body":"Your opening offers a very nice point of view +1"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa7f3890596ea15dcb499602b5e1aa34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":21218,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/21218/thawn","reputation":421,"display_name":"Thawn"},"score":0,"post_id":44165,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"edited":false,"creation_date":1457706154,"comment_id":76793,"body":"@Christiaan thanks :)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-on6yuwN5JEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/8oD_p798mqw/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16460,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16460/sanjukta-ghosh","reputation":432,"display_name":"Sanjukta Ghosh","accept_rate":38},"score":0,"post_id":44165,"edited":false,"creation_date":1457767216,"comment_id":76828,"body":"@Thawn Could we say that the ions (Na+) moving across the length of the axon cause conformational change in the voltage gated ion-channels and thereby opening adjacent ion channels, inducing a second action potential in new (adjacent) region of axon?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIqWF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19099,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19099/another-homo-sapien","reputation":1004,"display_name":"another 'Homo sapien'"},"score":1,"post_id":44165,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-on6yuwN5JEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/8oD_p798mqw/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16460,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16460/sanjukta-ghosh","reputation":432,"display_name":"Sanjukta Ghosh","accept_rate":38},"edited":false,"creation_date":1457777625,"comment_id":76838,"body":"@SanjuktaGhosh Yes, that&#39;s how action potential reaches the adjacent areas.

There are significant differences in what you will be able to do with a Bachelor's, Master's or PhD, depending on what exactly you end up doing. <\/p>\n\n<p>I entered a PhD program in biology for no better reason than that I felt awed and fascinated with science and had done really well in science subjects as an undergrad. Grad school seemed like a natural extension of that effort. <\/p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, my motivations for pursuing a PhD were horribly naïve and easily the greatest challenge that I faced as a grad student was that of defining why I was there and where I wanted to go with my degree. So, to address the issue of vagueness in your question, my first piece of advice is to have a firmer idea of what you want to do. Plans will change, but simply having a plan (a real plan) might provide an anchor when you need one.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to what you can do with the various degrees, I can't precisely answer your question, the way you've phrased it, but I can give you a general idea. <\/p>\n\n<p>A bachelor's degree in biology will not get you far in a lab setting. Among the lab techs I've worked with, even most of them have master's degrees. From what I've seen, this holds just as true for academia as for industry. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's a little unclear what you mean by \"planning\", but most of the admin that I work with, who are involved in planning our various projects also hold advanced degrees, typically in science, business or public health. I see a strong representation among the management at my institution (Columbia University) of PhD scientists, who left the bench for something less life-consuming, while still wanting to have a hand in research. These people are frequently grants managers or program directors. <\/p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the lab techs around me generally hold master's degrees. When I was considering quitting my PhD program after the master's component, a friend in industry advised me against it, if I ever thought that I might seek work in industry. The picture that he painted was that in industry, a master's degree makes you overqualified for many of the tasks that you can expect to be hired for, but underqualified for significant future career advancement. <\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously, you shouldn't feel limited to academic vs industrial research tracks. There are plenty of other options out there. Maybe look up people's blogs that involve synthetic biology or whatever other topics of interest you might have to get a wider view of what people who have expertise in the subject are doing. <\/p>\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","answer_id":44379,"question_id":44377,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44377/a-career-in-synthetic-biology","last_activity_date":1458230028,"creation_date":1458225980,"answer_count":1,"title":"A career in synthetic biology","body":"<p>So I am thinking about a career in synthetic biology, but I am not sure what route should/needs to be taken.

That goes for all pathogens, even ones you might find around your house.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a professional lab, you might get samples from collaborators, clinical samples, vendor, or really an number of other professional resources.  A well respected vendor as an example is <a href=\"http://www.atcc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATCC<\/a>, but the general public wouldn't be able to \"shop\" there.<\/p>\n\n<p>But you really don't need to go far to get a whole host of microbes to study, you can grow them all at your house.  The basics of bacteria culturing can really be broken down to three steps: (1) get a source of bacteria, (2) put some of the bacteria in an environment where they can grow easily, and (3) harvest them to do something useful with them. <\/p>\n\n<p>(1) Is fairly easy, bacteria are everywhere.  You can swab nearly any surface of anything in your house and come up with microbes (note you might also get some mold/fungi).  In this case (3) is easy as well.  Once you have culture you can streak it across a slide to view it under a microscope (you could also use several proper mounting techniques).  After all, looking at microbes under a microscope is the real goal here!<\/p>\n\n<p>The only part of this plan that will take some real elbow grease is making your own culture dishes at home, but it's not as hard as you might think.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Making your own culture dishes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>1) The \"plates\" themselves.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I recommend getting the smallest Tupperware like containers your can\n  find that are microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and really make a good\n  seal (water tight at the least). They really don't have to be big, and\n  you will make your life easier if you buy a bunch to match. They need\n  to be super clean. After running them through your dishwasher at home,\n  put them all in a boiling pot of water until you are ready to pour in\n  your \"medium.\" A mid-low simmer will work<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that you won't probably be able to have perfect sterile technique at your house, but you should try to do what you can.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Your \"Medium\" or Broth<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I highly recommend using pectin as your gelling agent if you can't get\n  your hands on some agar. After that comes plain unflavored gelatin,\n  but I recommend pectin. You can get it at almost any grocery store and\n  my recipe is made assuming that. You can determine how much you want\n  to make, just scale up the ratios. I'm going to list things as rough\n  volume by volume so you won't need a scale.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>i) Make the powder first:<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>45mL of pectin;<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>4 bouillon cubes ground as finely as you can (you can get different\n  types and results depending on if you start with vegetable, beef, or\n  chicken. I recommend starting with vegetable.);<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>125mL of refined white sugar;<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Additives (more on this later)<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  \n  <p>ii) Mix the powder into 500mL of water.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Before you mix in the powder, heat the water to 50-75<sup>o<\/sup>C (mid low heat), but not boiling. Mix the powder in while stirring until\n  dissolved.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>iii) Bring the mixture up to a boil. Let it boil for about 2 min,\n  stirring all the while.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>iv) Cover the pot and let it cool for 4-5 min.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>You by no means want it to cool down to room temperature, you just want\n  to get it a little below boiling. If you are at 55<sup>o<\/sup>C or below it's\n  definitely time move on.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>v) Dip/fill your \"plates\" 1/3 full of media using clean/sterile\n  utensils and seal while hot but not boiling.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>You may have noticed this seems an awful lot like canning, and that's\n  because it is. Again you want to be as clean as possible in this step\n  and of course try not to burn yourself on anything.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>vi) Let your media plates set and chill over night in the\n  refrigerator.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>You really probably only have to wait a few hours if you are anxious\n  to get going. You are going to want to store the plates that you are\n  not using in the refrigerator anyway. Also if you made a bunch of\n  plates, let the cool on a counter before you put them in the fridge so\n  that you don't raise the temp of your fridge too much.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Remember the thing about additives? You can play around with adding\n  different amounts and different types of salts, vitamins, food, or\n  other items to see how they affect the cultures you get to grow. All\n  kinds of fun there. First go round, leave them all out.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now you have your own home made culture plates! The above recipe was empirically tested by my childhood, and repeated by my son's. Not all pectin from the store may be equal, this is with Ball Classic (I have no relation to the company). I'd love to know people's results in trying it, because I might need to re-think how/what I'm doing to get it to work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Go around your house swabbing things with sterile swabs (you can get these at a drug store), and then streak them out on plate. While it will be a little different with a swab and homemade plate, the idea is similar to what is done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAm21yPGMRo\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leave your plate in a warm wet place, but not in direct sunlight. Ideal temp is going to be around 37, but you can leave them above and below that and still get things to grow. On top of our dryer is where I leave them.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a day or so you should have colonies you can streak out on a slide and look under a scope. You will find all kinds of things this way. If you want a more formal way to put things on a slide, you can check out dry and wet mounting from a Google search.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are actually quite likely to run into E.coli if you sample enough \"areas\" this way. Obviously don't eat or huff the stuff that ends up growing. Maybe you can post some fun pictures of this if you try it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As pointed out in the comments, if you successfully get bacteria to grow, then you will need to successfully get rid of them.  I should point that a good set of rubber gloves (that you can bleach and wash after use), or disposable gloves are a really good idea when handling plates that have grown bacteria.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Clean Up<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>First off, I want to clearly say that this stuff can clog a pipe.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you tried to grow something on a plate, and you didn't get a colony that you can see with the naked eye (note some microbes might make CLEAR growths) you can <em>probably<\/em> just scoop the gel into the trash.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that I said <em>probably<\/em>.  If you swapped any part of your body, waste, or that of an animal you <strong>must<\/strong> decontaminate even if you didn't see anything grow.  On the plus side decontamination is easy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>If you did see something grow, or you otherwise need decontamination:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>First make a 20% bleach solution in a large Tupperware like container (probably don't want to do this is a nice metal pot, but could do it in a junk one).  You can go as low as 10% bleach solution if you sure your bleach is NOT a cheap already watered down brand (like something bought at dollar store).  But just to be sure, I recommend 200mL of bleach in 800mL of plain tap water.<\/p>\n\n<p>Drop your plates and lids into the bath (with the lid off) and let it sit for 10-15 min.  Then, working under/in the bleach solution with your gloves on, use a fork/spoon to get out the medium (it will be like thick jello).  Do this for all your plates, and you can do more than one at a time this way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have all the medium out and floating in the bleach, take the plates out and put them in the dishwasher.  Strain out the bleach/medium/funkiness you grew through a cheap colander (I recommend dishwasher safe plastic like PP).  Put what get's caught in the colander in the trash and take the trash out.  Wash the plates, lids, colander, and large container you used for the beach bath.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Slides<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Slides present extra caution because they can break or shatter to create sharp edges.  For the most part, if you cover your sample with a cover slip, and seal it with nail polish, you can actually keep your slides indefinitely with little risk.  If you do decide to dispose of them, they should first go into a thick Ziploc bag (use an expensive freezer guard type bag for this) or into a Tupperware you don't mind throwing away.

The <em>(Gibbs) free energy of hydrolysis<\/em> of the phosphoanydride bonds between the gamma and beta phosphates and betweeen the alpha and beta phosphates is relatively large in terms of biological reactions. This means that coupling of the hydrolysis of ATP (usually, but not always, to ADP \u2014 adenosine 5'-diphosphate) to a reaction that is energetically unfavourable can often produce an overall reaction that is energetically favourabe (has an overall negative free energy change). Enzymes have evolved to catalyse such coupled reactions involving ATP.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although ATP is often referred to as having \u2018energy-rich bonds\u2019 this is not the best way of thinking of things. First, and perhaps most important, you cannot think of energy in abstract, and even referring to \u2018breaking a bond\u2019 is insufficient. One is talking about free energy <em>change<\/em> which must relate to a specific reaction, in this case hydrolysis: <\/p>\n\n<p>ATP + H<sub>2<\/sub>O → ADP + PO<sub>4<\/sub><sup>3\u2013<\/sup> <em>or less frequently<\/em> ATP + H<sub>2<\/sub>O → AMP + pyrophosphate<\/p>\n\n<p>Second the free energy change is only \u2018high\u2019 in relation to cellular reactions.

The effective drug concentration depends on the drug-receptor association constant and the drug degradation constant (for a highly simplified model). The degradation/removal depends on the abundance of the enzyme catalyzing this reaction. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ethanol is primarily thought to cause intoxication by activation of GABA<sub>A<\/sub> receptors. However, only a very specific subclass of these receptors are activated at the levels of alcohol that one consumes during \"social/moderate\" drinking. Others require very high alcohol concentrations (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0509903103\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hanchar et al., 2006<\/a>). Basically alcohol is not a very specific agonist/antagonist of any neurotransmitter or neuromodulator receptors. In other words, it does not have high affinity to any of these receptors. There is no answer to \"why\". I would guess that since ethanol is a very common molecule (and is also used as energy substrate by some organisms, to a certain extent), high sensitivity to ethanol would have been evolutionarily selected against. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although many proteins show changes in their function at very high\n  alcohol concentrations (>50 mM), the molecular basis for behavioral\n  alcohol effects at low to moderately intoxicating doses experienced\n  during social alcohol consumption remains elusive (1). GABA<sub>A<\/sub> receptors\n  (GABA<sub>A<\/sub>Rs) and the inhibitory GABAergic system have long been suspected\n  to be targets for acute alcohol effects (2\u20134). For example, the GABA<sub>A<\/sub>R\n  agonist muscimol potentiates the sedative actions of alcohol, whereas\n  the opposite effect, a reduction of ethanol (EtOH)-produced sedation,\n  is detected with the GABA<sub>A<\/sub>R blockers picrotoxin and bicuculline (5).\n  Although most GABAAR subunit combinations can be activated by high\n  (anesthetic) alcohol concentrations (6), only very specific GABA<sub>A<\/sub>R\n  subunit combinations (containing the δ as well as the β3 subunit)\n  exhibit dose dependencies that mirror blood alcohol levels that are\n  associated with mild to moderate intoxication in humans (7, 8) (≈3\u201330\n  mM, because the legal drinking limit is 17 mM or 0.08%).\n  <hr>\n  <sup><em>From Hanchar et al., 2006<\/em><\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Other psychoactive drugs are highly specific and have high affinity to their corresponding receptors.
