I don't know Karp at all, but a quick search indicates he's known for soothing babies by swaddling. Great. My mother swaddled all her infants many decades ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>If he is comparing human neonates to  primate neonates, he's correct. Baby primates are born pretty much knowing how to cling onto the mother with four extremities, necessary because primates are quadripedal, and need their arms to walk as well, meaning baby needs to hold on, aided by opposable toes. (Chimps and gorillas do support the baby with one hand longer, though.<\/p>\n\n<p>But what evolutionary advantage would it serve for our infants to come out grasping? humans are bipedal, meaning we have arms that can be used to carry an infant. If we need our arms, we have the intelligence to fashion slings or carriers.\nThe same goes for any ability: sight, motor skills, etc. They don't need to be born with these skills, because they are cared for.<\/p>\n\n<p>Antelopes drop a newborn which is up in minutes and able to see and run. Cats drop a newborn which can wiggle, crawl some, is blind and as helpless as a human.<\/p>\n\n<p>Babies, through evolution, are able to live outside the womb (assuming no complications) without extraordinary maternal assistance from about 36 weeks on. A look at growth charts show steep rises in both cranial size and weight gain.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fZ5gQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>But you can see that a baby's head at the 10%ile takes at least six weeks to catch up to a baby the size of one born at 90%ile. Why doesn't that baby just gestate for 6 more weeks?<\/p>\n\n<p>There is much more than head size going on here. There is the placental size, the amount of amniotic fluid, the possibility of meconium aspiration, etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>Stillbirths are twice as common at 42 weeks and 4 times as common at 43 weeks.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Approximately 20% of postterm (41 weeks gestation) fetuses have fetal postmaturity syndrome, with chronic intrauterine growth restriction from uteroplacental insufficiency. These pregnancies are at increased risk of umbilical cord compression from oligohydramnios, [low Apgar scores], intrauterine passage of meconium, and short-term neonatal complications (such as hypoglycemia, seizures, and respiratory insufficiency). ...[T]he 4-fold decrease in the incidence of the meconium aspiration syndrome in the United States from 1990-1998 has been attributed primarily to a reduction in the postterm delivery rate [(induced delivery at 41.5 weeks)]. Postterm pregnancy is also an independent risk factor for neonatal encephalopathy and for death in the first year of life.[17, 18] <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Maternal complications and death also increase with post-term deliveries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Are term babies actually evolutionary preemies? I haven't read Dr. Karp's book or heard his reasoning, but it seems superficial to me. Medically, from an infant and maternal standpoint, a 38 week delivery is ideal. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the female uterus and pelvis, and the fetal placenta and amniotic fluid found the most favorable time for delivery into a <em>human environment<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we gestated for two years, like elephants, yes, our babies would be more capable at birth, but we aren't elephants, and mothers and babies would die.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261369-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Postterm Pregnancy<\/a> (Medscape) \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#Birthing_and_calves\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elephant birthing and calves<\/a> (Wikipedia)<\/p>\n","answer_id":21451,"question_id":21446,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21446/evolutionary-support-for-parenting-book-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block","last_activity_date":1411065147,"creation_date":1411048606,"answer_count":1,"title":"Evolutionary support for parenting book \"The happiest baby on the block\"","body":"<p>The book by Dr Harvey Karp (MD) <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0553381466\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Happiest Baby on the Block<\/a><\/em> proposes that the duration of human gestation has evolved as a tradeoff between cranial size and development of the infant.  He hypothesizes that from an overall developmental perspective human babies are all premature and would benefit from additional time in their mother's womb; however, because humans have such big brains, and therefore our babies have big brains, the infant needs to be born earlier than would be developmentally ideal so that it doesn't get stuck in the birth canal.  The result is babies that have big brains but are highly vulnerable and dependent on their parents until their development progresses further.<\/p>\n\n<p>I discussed this with some students in class as an example of the use of ideas from human evolutionary ecology and life history theory in the popular press, but with the disclaimer that I had no idea if any of Karp's ideas are backed up by any evolutionary or anthropological data.

The heterozygotes are assumed to have half of that differential. This is what Fry refers to on page 2 (page 1511 of the publication):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Kidwell et al.\u2019s notation ... the most fit genotype in a given sex has a relative fitness of 1, and $s_m$ and $s_f$ are the selection coefficients against the less-fit homozygote (or hemizygote) in males and females, respectively.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For opposing selection with arbitrary dominance, Kidwell parameterizes the heterozygous fitness components as<\/p>\n\n<p>$w_{m2} = 1-h_ms_m$, and<\/p>\n\n<p>$w_{f2} = 1-h_fs_f$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notice that $h$ is modifying the fitness difference $s$ in the heterozygotes. This is due to incomplete dominance of one allele over the other. If both alleles in a heterozygote contribute equally to the phenotype, then $h = 0.5$, and you have the additive fitness described above ($w = 1-.5s$).<\/p>\n\n<p>If one allele is incompletely dominant over the other, the selective difference $s$ will be modified by some amount, $h$. If A$_1$ is only slightly dominant over A$_2$, (say, $h=0.6$), the effect on $w$ won't be much different than if $h=0.5$. Both alleles will affect fitness but the more dominant allele will have a slightly greater affect on fitness than the other allele. If one allele is much more dominant, then $h$ becomes larger and the more dominant allele contributes more to the overall fitness than the other allele.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if $h=1$ then one allele is completely dominant so the other allele will not contribute at all to fitness. When $h=1$, the equations reduce to $w = 1 - s$ (for the respective genders), remembering that $h$ is based on the dominance of the allele with maximum fitness in the <em>other<\/em> gender. <\/p>\n\n<p>Consider a female. Her maximum fitness is the A$_2$A$_2$ genotype.  If A$_1$ is completely dominant over A$_2$, then a heterozygous female would have fitness equal to the A$_1$A$_1$ genotype which, for females is defined as $w = 1-s_f$. On the other hand, if A$_1$ is not completely dominant over A$_2$, then the heterozygote will have some reduction in fitness but not as much as for complete dominance.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer your final question about your figure, given the following values for A$_1$A$_1$, A$_1$A$_2$, and $_2$A$_2$, respectively:<\/p>\n\n<p>$w_m = 1, 0.9, 0.2$, and<\/p>\n\n<p>$w_f = 0.3, 0.7, 1$, then<\/p>\n\n<p>$s_m = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$, and<\/p>\n\n<p>$s_f = 1 - 0.7 = 0.7$.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the heterozygosity effect ($h$), given that<\/p>\n\n<p>$w = 1 - hs$, then<\/p>\n\n<p>$h = \\frac{1-w}{s}$, therefore<\/p>\n\n<p>$h_{m2} = \\frac{1 - 0.9}{0.8} = 0.125$. <\/p>\n\n<p>A$_1$ is nearly completely dominant over A$_2$ in males, so the presence of A$_2$ is the male is not reducing his fitness by very much.

It doesn't influence his genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>To actually influence evolution of bonobos, I imagine it would look like this: You capture 4/5ths of all the bonobos in the world (leave the 1/5 for genetic pool variation). You test them for basics of quick-wittedness. Kill all the bonobos that fall below a certain threshold, and release. Repeat several generations later. Keep doing so for 50 cycles. What you will have are a race of quick-witted bonobos - <em>maybe<\/em>. Because if the quick-wittedness you selected for doesn't provide them with a survival advantage, it (and they) will die out. What if the smarter bonobos all want to be alphas, and all that fun cuddling and sex-as-peacekeeping were to disappear? They might not survive the bonobo-chimpanzee wars, because they won't live in large, peaceful, cooperative groups any more. Maybe you can teach the bonobos to plant crops, assuring a food source. Will they irrigate, too? What would this decrease in roaming mean for pygmies who hunt bonobos for food?<\/p>\n\n<p>My point is, we can't control evolution very much unless we also control the total environment they live in. That's one way we have been able to have such an impact on a rather extraordinary species: dogs. But in the end, a dog, whether it's a sheep-herding or rat-catching or boar-hunting or bull-baiting or duck-fetching breed, is still only a dog.

The fiber axis is basically the dimension along the length of the DNA strand.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Longer: <\/p>\n\n<p>Watson and Crick created their model of DNA based on the esoteric experiment called X-ray <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_diffraction\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiber diffraction<\/a>.  To collect fiber diffraction data ( gathered by Rosalind Franklin actually) DNA is pulled out of a cell lysate and washed with buffer.  It looks like a clear, <a href=\"http://www.protocol-online.org/biology-forums/posts/40140.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">liquid, string of snot<\/a> (a technical term that is).  Its stringy though because the long DNA molecules pull out and create viscous fluid where the DNA is pulled along the length of the snot fiber.  Because the DNA is ordered in this one dimension, if you shoot a beam of X-rays through it, it creates a pattern on film that looks like this: <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGbwq.jpg\" alt=\"fiber diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see its got a nice X-shaped pattern.  The DNA in the fiber is mostly aligned along the fiber, in the up and down direction.  Because this is so, the spacings between the different layers is due to the spacings between the DNA bases and the x-pattern comes from the fact that DNA forms a double helix.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Some misc details - you have to use X-rays because their wavelength is about the size of an atomic bond and this is the scale of model Watson and Crick and Franklin and Wilkinson were trying to find.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The fiber axis is along the y axis (top to bottom) because the trail of DNA snot hangs down - it will sag if you hold it an angle.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Rosalind Franklin was a great experimentalist and she realized that the DNA snot trail dries out over time as the experiment would go on for days.  She set up a moist stream of hydrogen gas blowing over the DNA strand during the X-ray experiment and so was the only experimentalist who obtained what we now know to be the true result - double helical DNA.  As it dries out, DNA interconverts to the Z-DNA form I believe, which does not have the x-pattern and also confuses things because the result is a smear of the DNA helix converting from one form to another.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Francis Crick had actually predicted the X-pattern for helices.  The structure actually required these two to come together to get the answer while the American genius Linus Pauling was working hard in California on the structure as well and would have won too if he understood how to keep his snot properly damp. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reference for nearly all of this is Watson's somewhat self-centered but historically accurate book \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_Helix\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Double Helix<\/a>\".  <\/p>\n\n<p>After some surprisingly difficult Googling, I can't found a picture of DNA fiber... picture below.

Their thorough analysis (especially for the late 1990s) showed that the Florida panther and the western North American pumas were the same subspecies, <em>Puma concolor couguar<\/em> (note the proper spelling of the subpecies). All individuals north of Nicaragua are this subspecies. From Nicaragua south into South America, they recognized five additional subspecies of American Puma.  The distribution of the subspecies, as well as the sample locations, are shown in the figure below, taken from Culver et al.

Because the genetics of the Florida Panther and the western American Puma are effectively the same, individuals from the western US can be introduced into southern Florida. This idea was first proposed (to my knowledge) by <a href=\"http://parkinson.cos.ucf.edu/Courses/PCB5556C/pdf/Hedrick_panther.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hedrick (1995)<\/a> as a conservation measure by introducing genetic variation and reduce the effects of inbreeding. In that same year, eight female pumas were transferred to Florida from Texas, which had the population of panthers closest to Florida.

(2010)<\/a> performed a genetic analysis of the Florida population. They showed that the Texas females were indeed reproducing in Florida. The release of Texas panthers did introduce more genetic variation into the Florida population and reduce the effects of inbreeding. The net effect was that more Florida panthers were surviving. The downside is that habitat loss continues and the <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21102/definition-of-effective-population-size\">effective population size<\/a> is still very small. That means that inbreeding is still very much an issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>The studies to date have focused on genetic integration and overall recovery due to the introduction of genetic variation but I did not find any studies that reported any behavioral changes since the 1995 introduction. Given that it was only 8 females, I would not expect any significantly different behaviors to be introduced into the Florida population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Introducing more genetic variation from Texas (and perhaps populations farther west) may be helpful but ultimately preservation of habitat and improving ability of individuals to move among available <a href=\"http://www.floridapanthernet.org/index.php/handbook/threats/habitat_fragmentation1/#.VBTLLFbLx94\" rel=\"nofollow\">habitat fragments via corridors<\/a> is necessary to protect the species long term.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Culver, M. et al. 2000.

In the case of the major histocompatibility complex, it is a group of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27156/\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 200 genes on chromosome 6<\/a> (Janeway et al. 2001). The set of alleles$^1$ inherited together from one parent form the MHC haplotype. Thus, one offspring will inherit two different MHC haplotypes, one from each parent. The different haplotypes with so many genes helps keep genetic variation in the overall complex, which improves the immune response ability of the organism.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The term is derived from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/haploid-309\" rel=\"nofollow\">haploid<\/a>, which means half of the normal set of chromosomes. Humans for example are <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/diploid-310\" rel=\"nofollow\">diploid<\/a>, meaning it has two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from the mother (maternal) and one inherited from the father (paternal). So, when you inherit just one half of the crhomosome pair, you are inheriting a haplotype.<\/p>\n\n<p>For general reference, it's important to note that haplotype was not always used to reference a group of two or more genes inherited together. It was commonly used to as a term to represent a sequence of nucleotides together on the same chromosome, even if only part of a single gene. For example, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/92/9/3731.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bowen et al.

The control region is over 1000 nucleotides in size but Bowen and colleagues only used 350 nucleotides from part of the control region.

Fast cells are better off as rods with a certain length-to-width ratio, chemotactic cells must adopt shape ratios in line with their environments, and cells that forage near surfaces or navigate viscous environments may do best if they are slightly curved or spiral.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Predation<\/strong>: In their struggle against being eaten, bacteria have adopted morphological defenses that may have produced the wealth of shapes we now observe.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These factors play a role in shaping bacteria. Further he explains what in general gives the shape to bacteria:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bacterial morphology is affected by a combination of selective pressures - access to nutrients, cell division, attachment/dispersal, predation and motility (among others). Among these different factors, our understanding of the relationship between motility and cell shape is most complete; for example, highly motile bacteria are usually rods with a specific (optimal) shape and size, and movement through viscous fluids seems to a favor spiral shape. But since multiple selective forces are always in play, there is at the moment no way to predict cell shape based on the environment or vice versa.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.infection-research.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Perspectives2009/August2009/Perspective-BacterialShapes--12_08_2009.pdf\">Shape Matters: Why bacteria care how they look<\/a> - This article highlights Kevin's work explaining why shapes matter for bacteria and they take it seriously for survival.<\/p>\n\n<p>So adaptations to various environments could be possible but depending upon the environment we can not predict the shape of bacteria because some other factor might have played major role in giving shape to it.

Almost all bacteria have a cell wall made of a substance called peptidoglycan, a mesh of peptides and saccharides that provides rigidity and strength to the bacteria. This wall is produced through a complex series of steps that starts inside the cell, where the peptide and sugar units are attached to a lipid to make a compound called Lipid II. However, Lipid II must be flipped to the outer layer of the cell membrane to deliver the peptides and sugars to the growing cell wall. The proteins responsible for flipping the Lipid II are believed to be FtsW, RodA, and SpoVE. FtsW is considered the main enzyme for most cell growth. RodA is found in rod shaped bacteria and is considered necessary for cell elongation. SpoVE is used to build the thick cell walls of bacterial spores.

I don't know of a single reference that supports/rebuts the Spandrels paper but consider <a href=\"http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Why Evolution is True<\/em><\/a> by Jerry Coyne, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Show_on_Earth:_The_Evidence_for_Evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Greatest Show in Earth<\/em><\/a> by Richard Dawkins, and <a href=\"http://seanbcarroll.com/endless-forms-most-beautiful/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful<\/em><\/a> by Sean Carroll. None of these address directly the charges lodged by the Spandrels paper but they do show how evolutionary biology is integrative of many ideas instead of isolating each trait without considering the biology of the entire organism. (I have no commerical interest in any of these books. I simply support the ideas presented.)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Long version from my perspective.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In 1979, <a href=\"http://www.stephenjaygould.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stephen J. Gould<\/a> and Richard C. Lewontin (hereafter, G&amp;L) published a paper, \"<a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme<\/a>\", in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B.  The title of the paper mixes two metaphors. The first is the character Dr. Pangloss from <a href=\"http://www.literature.org/authors/voltaire/candide/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Voltaire's \"Candide<\/a>.\" Dr. Pangloss is a bit of an optimist, who <a href=\"http://www.literature.org/authors/voltaire/candide/chapter-01.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">says<\/a>,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is demonstrable ... that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. ... [A]nd they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.\" - Dr. Pangloss<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Dr. Pangloss is saying that everything has a purpose, and each thing is designed specifically for that purpose. G&amp;L extend this metaphor to evolutionary biologists.  G&amp;L claim that evolutionary biologists (at least to the time of their publication) tended to make claims similar to Dr. Pangloss: every trait that could be found on an organism results from natural selection and adaptation.  G&amp;L write,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past forty years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary \"traits\" and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. - G&amp;L<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, the Panglossian paradigm. Every trait has an adaptive purpose and is necessarily the \"best\" that it can be. G&amp;L then argue that evolutionary biologists of the time failed to consider the entire organism when assigning adaptive value to each trait separately.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion ... that organisms must be analyzed as integrated wholes, with <em>bauplane<\/em> so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development, and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. - G&amp;L<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>G&amp;L are saying that the many organismal traits are functions of evolutionary history, developmental pathways, and other structural contraints.  G&amp;L argue that most evolutionary biologists of the time did not consider the entire organism when ascribing adaptive value to any one trait. In G&amp;L Panglossian metaphoric terms, evolutionary biologists had decided that the adaptive value of the nose was to support glasses, but they had failed to consider that the nose may have evolved for other reasons (e.g., smell) and that the supportive value of the nose was an evolutionar by-product instead of an evolutionary cause. <\/p>\n\n<p>This brings us to the second metaphor, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel\" rel=\"nofollow\">architectural spandrels<\/a>. Spandrels are <a href=\"http://youthvoices.net/sites/default/files/image/2713/jan/the_spandrels_of_san_marco_and_the_panglossian_paradigm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">triangular spaces<\/a> that form when two arches meet, or when an arch meets a rectangle.  According to G&amp;L, spandrels are a necessary by-product of the architectural joining of the two shapes. The spandrel itself serves no purpose. In evolutionary terms, spandrels have no adaptive significance that resulted from natural selection. Instead, they are an evolutionary by-product that resulted from selection on other traits (arches and rectangles).<\/p>\n\n<p>While the architectural metaphor <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020118023602/http://www.americanscientist.org/articles/96articles/Mark-full.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently fails<\/a>, their primary argument does not change.  Traits cannot be considered individually. Traits of an organisms must be evaluated as one part of the entire organism, together with it's developmental biology and its evolutionary history. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here are two examples to represent their argument, written for a general audience. The first example is based on the human hand.  Our hand has five fingers. Each finger except the thumb has three bones (called phalanges), which you can see easily when you curl your finger. The thumb has only two phalanges. What is the adaptive value of having four fingers with three bones each, and a thumb with two bones? You might say that such a structure imparts excellent manual dexterity, from grasping to manipulating objects. But, would we not have that same dexterity if we had four fingers, or six? Why does the thumb have only two bones and not three? How could that be adaptive? These specific traits may not be the direct result of natural selection.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The structure of our hand is explained by our evolutionary history. Our primate ancestors had five fingers. So did our earliest mammalian ancestors, as did our earliest reptilian ancestors. However, some of the earliest amphibian ancestors, such as <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Acanthostega_gunnari/15016\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acanthostega<\/a>, had more than five digits (toes, fingers). Somewhere in early amphibian evolutionary history, our ancestral lineage converged on five digits, and most descendant vertebrates retain that five digit pattern. Even those vertebrates today without five digits usually display five digits during development, such as the <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/06/19/limusaurus-is-awesome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ostrich<\/a> (scroll down to image of blue-stained bones). If we assigned an adaptive purpose to the  human hand independently of its evolutionary history, we might very well be wrong.  Science doesn't like wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>Think about the five toes of your foot. Each toe has three bones except for the big toe, which has two bones. Manual dexterity? No. Evolutionary history? Yes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second example is the groove in your upper lip below your nose. This groove is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philtrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">philtrum<\/a>. Can you think of an adaptive function for the philtrum? You might think that it helps to direct odors towards our nostrils, or hypothesize some other adaptive purpose. However, it appears that the philtrum is a by-product of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFY_KPFS3LA\" rel=\"nofollow\">development of our embryonic face<\/a> (YouTube video). The trait of our philtrum may not have adaptive significance. It is a by-product our face formation when the two sides meet in the middle.<\/p>\n\n<p>G&amp;L's publication produced quite an uproar. It's easy to find criticisms of the paper. Some have <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020118023602/http://www.americanscientist.org/articles/96articles/Mark-full.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">criticized the architectural metaphor<\/a>. A bad metaphor does not necessarily make a bad scientific argument. Others have criticized the scientific rigor of their arugments. This <a href=\"http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/why-the-spandrels-of-san-marco-isnt-a-good-paper/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog entry<\/a>, associated with the respected ecology journal <em>Oikos<\/em>, dislikes the paper and identifies several problems. The Oikos blog also links to several other sites that either support or dislike the G&amp;L article. Most evolutionary biologists disliked the claim that they did not see the \"whole organism.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Rightfully so, I think. I do not know of one evolutionary biologist (myself included) that has ever considered a particular trait without considering the broader evolutionary history of an organism. Indeed, considerable effort is spent by evolutionary biologists to determine how the evolutionary history of an organism influences its trait. The same applies for evolutionary developmental biology and other biological processes. For example, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/90/9/4087.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin et al. (1993)<\/a> related evolutionary rate to body size, metabolic rate, and generation time of various animals, a very integrative (not isolating) approach.<\/p>\n\n<p>To be fair, I think the G&amp;L paper needs to be considered in the context of its time. Remember that i was published in 1979. Reread the first G&amp;L quote above. They say, \"during the past forty years.\"  The G&amp;L paper was published in 1979. Forty years before this paper was published was during the <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/modsynth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"modern evolutionary synthesis.\"<\/a> Without going into details (ask another question on Biology.SE!) the modern evolutionary synthesis provided the genetic mechanism (and so much more) that explaiend how Darwin's concept of natural selection could actually work. Once the relationship between <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mendelian genetic inheritance<\/a> and natural selection was proposed, many evolutionary biologists tested this connection. It is not surprising to me that G&amp;L perceived this strong \"bias\" towards a selectionist (Panglossian) paradigm because many biologists of the time were trying to understand how Mendelian genetics contributed to natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the time of the modern synthesis, the structure of DNA was not yet known.  The structure was finally realized by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watson and Crick (and Franklin!)<\/a> in 1953, only 26 years before G&amp;L's paper. Today we think nothing about the DNA structure but molecular genetics has advanced so much since G&amp;L's publication that we have a <em>much<\/em> greater understanding of evolution and natural selection at the genetic level. Today, you can't study the evolution of a trait without considering its underlying genetic architecture.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, one of the most, and perhaps <em>the<\/em> most, important development in the field of evolutionary biology is the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). This field did not really mature as a discipline until about 2000, when the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US devoted an <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/97/9/4424.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">entire issue<\/a> to the topic. Developmental biology was a discpline that G&amp;L had argued was important to consider. I'd bet that even they had no idea how important the evo-devo discipline would become to understanding evolutionary change. Still, recognition of the relationship between evolution and development was recognized as long ago as the mid-1800s by <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ernst Haeckel<\/a>. Evolutionary biologists were not necessarily considering traits in isolation from evolutionary history or developmental biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the end, G&amp;L used broad brush strokes to paint evolutionary biologists into a small canvas, claiming that biologists had a narrow evolutionary viewpoint. The evolutionary biologists responded (then and now) that their perspective was wide, even when focused on a particular trait. <\/p>\n\n<p>The G&amp;L paper continues to prompt considerable debate, which I think is the value of their paper. Every young graduate student should be required to read the paper. Even jaded scientists need a refreshing jolt to an established way of thinking. Our thought processes will alway benefit when we are reminded that evolutionary biology is a broad discipline that must embrace many other disciplines to arrive at a full understanding of the history of life on Earth.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21377,"question_id":21346,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1410947039}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21346/what-is-the-spandrels-debate-about","last_activity_date":1410947039,"creation_date":1410871296,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the \"Spandrels\" debate about?","body":"<p>In a <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21272/\">former question<\/a>, as a side question, I asked a clarification about the \"Spandrels\" paper.

However, in a normal situation where exons are at the ends, if introns in an RNA are  all removed simultaneously than it is possible that the free 3' hydroxy group of say intron 2 could attack the 5' end of another intron leading to inappropriate cleavage of the intervening exon so having exons at the ends does not solve that problem.

Remember the formulation of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the equilibrium constant:<br>\n$$\n\\Delta G^o =  -RTln(K)\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be rewritten as follows:\n$$\nK = e^{-\\Delta G^o/RT}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>As $\\Delta G^o$ gets very negative, you can see that $K$ gets very positive.<\/p>\n\n<p>The equlibrium constant has two definitions that are both useful.

Into what do you want to change the sequence anyway?<\/p>\n\n<p>Then this is not the only mutation linked to SCC - mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A are more important here.

It is probably a good idea to target the mutant KNSTRN protein with a treatment as this is already done for other proteins (although these are usually enzymes), but changing it will most likely not only not work but cause other problems as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another problem (even when you use a synonymous codon which does not lead to an amino acid exchange) is that you can disrupt genetic regulatory regions. Not all of these regions are located in the promoters of genes, quite a number of them are found inside of genes.

In the work presented on <em>KNSTRN<\/em> quoted by the OP the authors report that 19 from a panel of 100 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) contained a mutation in <em>KNSTRN<\/em> (and furthermore three of these contained no other mutation across the six genes that were analysed (Fig. 1b)). Normalising for ORF length this makes it the 3rd most recurrent mutated gene. It would seem therefore that it a fairly important mutagenic target. In a broadened set of SCCs they found a total of 29 KSTRN mutations, and of these 13 were Ser24Phe (TCC>TTC) mutations, which they refer to as a 'hotspot'.<\/p>\n\n<p>Accepting the arguments in the answer from @Chris it is still interesting to consider how one might remove such a hotspot.

Cancer-associated KNSTRN mutations, most notably those encoding p.Ser24Phe, disrupt chromatid cohesion in normal cells, occur in SCC precursors, correlate with increased aneuploidy in primary tumors and enhance tumorigenesis in vivo.

But thanks again."}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1407394251,"creation_date":1407394251,"body":"<p>I am not sure whether I grasped the gist of your question appropriately, but let me provide some clarifications.  <\/p>\n\n<p>$\\text{Nerve}$ is simply a collection of axons. Therefore, all the spinal nerves are just bundles of assorted nerve axons.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, the origin of nerve is slightly ambiguous as far as its meaning is considered. It can mean the <strong>physical origin<\/strong>, the place where the particular branch of nerve starts off from a main trunk or some other nervous organ. It can also mean the location of the cell bodies the axons of which comprise the nerve, the <strong>functional origin<\/strong>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Now coming back to the question, the <em>physical<\/em> origin of the spinal nerves is not common. Each pair of spinal nerves originates from a specific segment of the spinal cord via two roots, the dorsal and the ventral. Therefore, each nerve originates separately and different spinal nerves cannot be traced back to a common physical origin. (The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauda_equina\" rel=\"nofollow\">cauda equina<\/a>, is actually a collection of several spinal nerves which move dorsally and periodically gives of the nerves out of the vertebral column. Although the nerves comprising the Cauda Equina, second lumbar nerve onwards, appear to have a common origin, they actually originate from their own specific segment and then move caudally as a bundle to overcome the developmental constraint of spinal cord being shorter than the vertebral column, necessitating the caudal movement of nerves within the column to emerge at appropriate points)  <\/p>\n\n<p>The <em>functional<\/em> origin is a bit more complicated. This is because each spinal nerve has a variety of nerve fibres. There are some sensory fibres with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion, there are motor fibres with their cell bodies in spinal cord, there are sympathetic fibres with cell bodies in the series of collateral or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_ganglion\" rel=\"nofollow\">sympathetic ganglia<\/a>, connected to the spinal nerve via gray and white <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramus_communicans\" rel=\"nofollow\">ramus communicans<\/a>. There can also be cell bodies located directly in medulla which passes nerve fibres in cranial nerves as well as through its branches into the sympathetic ganglia and ultimately into the spinal nerves. Sacral nerves also contain parasympathetic nerve fibres functionally originating in the CNS. Thus, considering the functional origin, though each spinal nerve has a lot of origins, there is a slight convergence of origins for different nerves. The sympathetic ganglia and the spinal cord are two places where the origins of different spinal nerves may coincide or be structurally and functionally integrated.  But it must be kept in mind that this is a very limited convergence. There is an appreciable uniqueness to the functional origin of each spinal nerve and hence we cannot say that they \"meet\".<br>\n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Spinal_nerve_CAT.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMAGE<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":20296,"question_id":19998,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWL7o.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9268,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9268/susan","reputation":2544,"display_name":"Susan"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1e4ea733c567c1fa186228bea11020a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8055,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8055/123","reputation":41,"display_name":"123"},"score":0,"post_id":21289,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410806990,"comment_id":33497,"body":"Thank you very much.

Each of these have different pathways.  <\/li>\n<li>Spinal nerves don\u2019t go to the brain. Rather, they synapse in the spinal cord with other neurons which in turn go to the brain (sometimes requiring one more synapse).<\/li>\n<li>In the case of motor neurons, we talk about <em>upper<\/em> and <em>lower<\/em> motor neurons.

These <em>first order<\/em> (primary sensory) neurons synapse at the spinal level they enter. The <em>second order neuron<\/em> decussates at that level and courses rostrally via the anterolateral column, ending up in the thalamus.

They are actually quite diffusely organized across the sensory and motor cortices. Here is a representation of the sensory cortex.* It is a schematic of the post-central gyrus with pictures to indicate where the signals from various body parts end up. The motor cortex is similar.

It has been suggested to them that they would benefit from statins and have asked me (a former biologist) to find out more.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've had a look at the mechanisms of action, which seem clear. But the clinical data is somewhat confusing.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems we can state with certainty that a small but significant number of users report relatively minor side effects, and a very tiny minority have serious ones.<\/p>\n\n<p>In term of the benefits, however, the picture is much less clear. I have found a variety of statistics about how they reduce cardiac events but what this translates to in terms of length of life and quality of life is not stated.<\/p>\n\n<p>One <a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk/health/medicines/statins-case-against.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">article<\/a> I looked at suggested that on average, someone at high risk of heart disease taking statins for 30 years would only live an extra 9 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>The author of that site has a book to sell, and may have an axe to grind. But there are several other articles out there - such as <a href=\"http://www.drbriffa.com/2013/02/12/can-statins-extend-life-and-if-so-by-how-much/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.zoeharcombe.com/2013/10/how-statin-drugs-really-lower-cholesterol-and-kill-you-one-cell-at-a-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10717431/Why-Ive-ditched-statins-for-good.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> - which make worrying claims about statins being both more unsafe and less beneficial than clinical trials suggest. In particular there seems very limited evidence of any benefits to women.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am inclined to treat these as alarmist nonsense - they have that sense of hysteria about them. But given that the authors look legitimate, that clinical trials data do not appear to agree with one another (widely varying in the percentage of users reporting side effects, for example), and that this is a relative, I wanted to get a second opinion.<\/p>\n\n<p>So - can someone please crunch the numbers and tell me what the benefits of statin use are in terms of life years and quality of life? Is there any benefit for women with or without heart disease?

It is discussed in this paper by <a href=\"http://www.ijpp.com/IJPP%20archives/1994_38_2/133-137.pdf\">Telles et al. (1994)<\/a>, among many others. The nostrils are used on an alternating cycle of about 2-3 hours, controlled by the <a href=\"http://www.ndrf.org/ans.html\">autonomic nervous system<\/a>. If you notice alternating congestion, that also seems to be coupled to the nasal cycle (Hasegawa and Kern <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/609283\">1977<\/a>, <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/635366\">1978<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Below, I explain that the nasal cycle may be an artifact of the way the autonomous system works in humans (and some other organisms) or it may provide a first barrier against invasion of infective organisms via the nose. The full answer requires some background information.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Wikipedia and the nasal cycle<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cycle\">nasal cycle<\/a>, nicely paraphrased in the answer by George Daccache, offers hints but not real answers.  For example, the Wiki section called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cycle#Research_on_the_effects\">Research on the effects<\/a> states,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1994, breathing through alternate nostrils showed effects on brain hemisphere symmetry on EEG topography.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>suggesting that perhaps natural nasal cycling relates somehow to communication or coordination between the two brain hemispheres. However, the cited study <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7876041\">(Stancak and Kuna 1994)<\/a> is based on forced alternate nostril breathing (FANB). The Wiki section then states,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>D.S. Shannahoff-Khalsa published in 2007 on the effect of this cycle and manipulation through forced nostril breathing on one side on the endogenous ultradian rhythms of the autonomic and central nervous system.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All this sentence ulimately says is that a 2007 looked at the effects of FANB on <a href=\"http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1163\">ultradian rhythms<\/a>. The Wiki secion doesn't actually include results from the study so it provides no useful information.$^1$ I will try to explain with more depth.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Forced Air Nostril Breathing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Forced Air Nostril Breathing (FANB) requires a person to close one nostril, breath in, close the second nostril and open the first nostril, and breath out. The person repeats this process several times in a 10-15 minute period. In fact, FANB is a yoga technique called <a href=\"http://www.artofliving.org/us-en/yoga/breathing-techniques/alternate-nostril-breathing-nadi-shodhan\">Nadi Shodhan Pranayama<\/a>. The Telles et al. paper mentioned above used FANB, as has nearly every study on the effects of the nasal cycle. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>None of these studies actually explain the natural nasal cycle.<\/em>  FANB is not natural. It changes natural breathing rhythms and requires the person to focus on the physical movements of the fingers to close the alternating nostrils. FANB occurs for a 10-15 minute period of time and is finished. This is not the same as the 2-3 hour natural nasal cycle. In my opinion, any conclusions drawn from studies using FANB apply only to FANB but not to the natural nasal cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Then why does the nasal cycle occur?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The nasal cycle is a natural ultradian cycle (see <a href=\"http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1163\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://sequencewiz.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lateralized-rhythms-of-the-central-and-autonomic-nervous-systems.-D.-Shannahoff-Khalsa.pdf\">here<\/a>. Not only is it present in humans, the nasal cycle has been observed in rats, rabbits, domestic pigs, cats and dogs (see references in <a href=\"http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/9/2/371.full.pdf\">Eccles 1996<\/a>]). Thus, the nasal cycle may at least be a feature of mammals but it may be a feature of other bilateral animals that use nostrils for respiration. In addition, the nasal cycle may be an artifact of the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals, and how the autonomic nervous system operates between the two sides. <\/p>\n\n<p>The autonomic nervous system controls the nasal cycle. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. Interestingly, these two divisions show a lateralized ultradian rhythm <a href=\"http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1163\">(Shannahoff-Khalsa 2007)<\/a>.  This means that the parasympathetic nervous system dominates one side of the body and the sympathetic nervous system dominates the other side of the body. The two systems later switch dominate sides. This dominance swithcing back and forth between the parasympathetic and sympathetic happens with a regular rhythmic cycle every few hours. As it happens, this switching between sides correlates very well with the nasal cycle <a href=\"http://sequencewiz.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lateralized-rhythms-of-the-central-and-autonomic-nervous-systems.-D.-Shannahoff-Khalsa.pdf\">(Shannahoff-Khalsa 1991)<\/a>.  When the parasympathetic-sympathetic systems switch sides, so do the nostrils. This is also associated with a switch in EEG activity between the two brain hemispheres <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/6874437\">(Werntz et al. 1983)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the nasal cycle may not have a specific function, adaptive or otherwise. Instead, it could result from dominance of the parasympathetic system. Whichever side is dominated by the parasympathetic system will have the primary nostril in use for respiration. However, others have argued that the nasal cycle does provide a function. For example, <a href=\"http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/9/2/371.full.pdf\">Eccles (1996)<\/a> argued that the nasal cycle may function as a respiratory defense mechanism. They found that the rate of cycling increases when nasal infection is present in the nose. They argue that the congestion-decongestion helps generate \"plasma exudate\" (nasal fluids derived from blood plasma) which may help remove bacteria and viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p>The nasal cycle is an interesting phenomenon but whether it evolved as an adaptation (such as a mechanism proposed by Eccles et al. (1996) or is simply an artifact of the operation of the autonomic nervous system may never be known for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Footnote<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One of many reasons why you should always interpret Wikipedia entries very cautiously, even skeptically.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Eccles, R. 1996.

I guess the fast breathing nostril is an optimization to detect as smell as quickly as possible even if it can&#39;t detect the full spectrum of smells."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e032a74b26c2116bfcad775ffdc45ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6166/iqandreas","reputation":185,"display_name":"IQAndreas"},"score":0,"post_id":21220,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ea8dd43bed181174b9fccfed2ea2c88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9249,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9249/plasmahh","reputation":101,"display_name":"PlasmaHH"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1410677099,"comment_id":33428,"body":"@PlasmaHH Would that game show happen to be QI? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1jvRJV91co\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=E1jvRJV91co<\/a> (from Series G episode 06)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ea8dd43bed181174b9fccfed2ea2c88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9249,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9249/plasmahh","reputation":101,"display_name":"PlasmaHH"},"score":0,"post_id":21220,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e032a74b26c2116bfcad775ffdc45ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6166/iqandreas","reputation":185,"display_name":"IQAndreas"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1410690104,"comment_id":33435,"body":"@IQAndreas no, it was a german one."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f198213713ce4cd7ed2f2b3815bc6aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9291,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9291/r00m","reputation":101,"display_name":"r00m"},"score":0,"post_id":21220,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410700040,"comment_id":33439,"body":"I didn&#39;t know about the autonomic nervous system, but I discovered this by myself when trying to unblock the other nostril (I have some kind of allergic rhinitis or smth - when I lay down I feel there&#39;s some mucus draining from one side to other) :D"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7d905fee974ee352a4e4a4b822917f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3550,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3550/django-reinhardt","reputation":146,"display_name":"Django Reinhardt"},"score":0,"post_id":21220,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410869033,"comment_id":33541,"body":"Wonderful answer!

Insights into how our brain imagines have been gained through a number of studies. There is not an \"imagination\" area of the brain. Instead, different areas, and often several at a time, may be used depending on the type of imagination. I'll highlight a few examples here.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/5/1139.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ogino et al. (2007)<\/a> asked 10 male participants to imagine feeling pain while watching pictures suggesting either pain or fear. Both pain and fear tended to activate an area of the brain called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex\" rel=\"nofollow\">anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)<\/a>, which helps to regulate blood pressure and heart rate among other basic nervous functions. Imagining pain activated not only the ACC but also another four areas of the brain were especially active. In comparison, fear tended to activate the ACC and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus\" rel=\"nofollow\">hypothalamus<\/a>, which regulates the \"flight or fight\" response. Both sides of the brain were activated at the same time.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bernardbaars.pbworks.com/f/Locked+in+volitional+brain+NI2007.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boly et al. (2007)<\/a> studied 12 brain-injured patients who where not capable of communicating. They were not in a coma. They were asked to imaging tasks involving spatial skills or motor skills. The two most common areas of the brain that were activated were the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_motor_area\" rel=\"nofollow\">supplementary motor area<\/a>, which helps to control movement, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premotor_cortex\" rel=\"nofollow\">dorsal premotor cortex<\/a>, which may contribute to movement and spatial coordination. (Wikipedia information so interpret cautiously.)<\/p>\n\n<p>A detailed study was recently provided in a study by <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/40/16277\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schlegel et al. 2013<\/a>. (An alternate version is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791746/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>; both versions are open access.) Summaries of their work written for the general public can be found in <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/how-imagination-works\" rel=\"nofollow\">Popular Science<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130916162003.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science Daily<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The scientists identified what they called the \"mental workspace\" which is not a particular region of the brain but instead is several different regions of the brain (from both sides of the brain) interacting together.<\/p>\n\n<p>The researchers asked the study participants (9 males and 6 females) to select from a set of abstract shapes to assemble a particular target shape.  The target shape (the one the participants had to create) was a 2x2 grid. Each abstract shape that to be selected would fit one of the grids. So, four abstract shapes had to be selected to assemble the target shape. They also tested the reverse: Given a target shape, could the participants identify the four abstract shapes needed to make the target shape.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the task, the researchers used <a href=\"http://fmri.ucsd.edu/Research/whatisfmri.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<\/a> to monitor brain activity. After the analysis of the fMRI results, they identified 11 distinct regions of the brain were active during the task.  In nearly all cases, the regions were active in both sides of the brain. However, I noticed that one region, the medial frontal cortex, only appeared to be active in the left side of the brain. This region was identified as one important component of the mental workspace for certain tasks.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The researchers concluded that four of the 11 regions were most important. You can see the regions of the brain in any four of the links above (and the abstract shapes in all but the Science Daily article). They argue that the interaction among the four major and seven minor regions contribute to our process of imagination.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each of the three studies I highlighted requires the participants to perform different types of imgination tasks. Each type of task showed that different regions of the brain were used. Each type of task also required that several areas of the brain were used simultaneously during the imagination process. Together, these results show that no single part of the brain is used for imagination. Instead, many different areas are used, depending on what the person is imagining.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Boly, M. et al. 2007.

I have to say that I am not sure this article would pass the imaginary smell test, although it didn't raise any serious red flags, except one.\nAmong other things, this article said that oxidation means inflammation. It said this in connection with use of rapeseed oil in said product, saying rapeseed oil is less saturated and therefore more likely to oxidize. It then implied, that when this oxidation takes place in the human body, it leads to inflammation.\nNow I am no biology, medicine, or nutrition specialist, but if something is still stuck in my head from high school biology, it is that inflammation is the physical manifestation of our immune system fighting off infection, no? Apart of some autoimmune reactions, I don't see how ingesting rapeseed oil could cause inflammation.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my question is this: is it really possible to safely say: \"oxidation = inflammation\"?

The underlying method for sequencing is the Sanger chain termination method which can have read lenghts between 100 and 1000 basepairs (depending on the instruments used). This means you have to break down longer DNA molecules, clone and subsequently sequence them. There are two methods possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_walking\" rel=\"nofollow\">chromosome (or primer) walking<\/a> and starts with sequencing the first piece. The next piece of DNA (which is  and then uses a specific primer from the end of the sequence. The next (contigous) piece of the sequence is then sequenced using a primer which is complementary to the end of the first sequence read and so on. This technique doesn't require much assembling, but you need a lot of primers and it is relatively slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>To overcome this problem the shotgun sequencing method was developed. Here the DNA is broken into different pieces (not all broken at the same place), cloned and sequenced with primers specific for the vector used for cloning. The leads to overlapping sequences which then have to be assembled into one sequence on the computer. This method allows the parallelization of the sequencing (you can prepare a lot of sequencing reactions at the same time and run them) which makes the process much faster and also avoids the need for sequence specific primers. The problems are to sequence repetitive sequences, as overlaps are not as clear here. To resolve this problems a first draft is made and then critical regions are resequenced using other techniques as primer walking.

You have a whole host of mechanisms in your body that try to prevent your DNA from changing, but they are not perfect.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good example of this is DNA degradation due to aging.  When discussing aging in biology, we use the technical term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence\">senescence<\/a>.  Of interest here is the shortening of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere\">telomeres<\/a> due to mistakes made in your cells as they continue to divide (copying the DNA to each new daughter cell).<\/p>\n\n<p>In a grown adult, there's not some master well of DNA somewhere such that if you change it there it will immediately change the DNA throughout your body.  Most of the cells in your body have DNA in them (red blood cells are just one example of cells that don't have DNA in the traditional sense). Most of these cells can and will divide over time (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis\">mitosis<\/a>) to produce new cells with copies of that DNA.  However, there are also plenty of cells that don't divide often or at all in healthy adults.  If one is concerned about schizophrenia, it would be important to note that many neurons in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system\">CNS<\/a> are in this group of static cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Considering environmental effects, there are plenty of things that can change your DNA. Radiation, gamma and x-rays in particular, do a great job of disrupting, degrading, and occasionally mutating DNA.  The class of chemicals and physical agents that can change DNA are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen\">mutagens<\/a>.  This shares a root with the verb mutate, which is when something is acting on genetic material to cause it change.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will note that I said genetic material, and not DNA.  Without getting too far into the debate of what is \"alive,\" DNA is most certainly not the only \"construction protocol\" for earthly organisms.  RNA is one common alternative, but there are weirder ones that are hard to describe like prions.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10711,"question_id":10710,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1380873808},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934a90404fe944a01135142de991d393?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4199,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4199/von-mises","reputation":746,"display_name":"von Mises"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"post_id":10715,"edited":false,"creation_date":1380902554,"comment_id":14212,"body":"<i>A person who becomes schizophrenic because of drug use does not become any more prone to having schizophrenic kids than a person who doesnt do drugs<\/i>.

Being good at playing piano is a result of a complex interaction of many factors, some of which may be genetic. A long line of pianists generation after generation may be a result of genes that, say, sharpen a persons auditory perception so they can hear and interpret notes better.

Any alternative polymerase mechanism needs to account for the source of the energy required for adding a nucleotide.<\/p>\n\n<p>The simplest way one can imagine to perform reverse 3'-5' polymerization would be to use nucleotide-3'-triphosphate instead of the nucleotide-5'-triphosphate every existing polymerase uses. This would allow for a practically identical mechanism as existing polymerases, just with different nucleotides as substrates. The problem with this model is that ribonucleotide-3'-triphosphates are less stable under acidic conditions due to the neighbouring 2'-OH (though this obviously only applies for RNA, not for DNA).<\/p>\n\n<p>So any 3'-5' polymerase would likely need to use the same nucleotide-5'-triphosphates as the 5'-3' polymerase. This would mean that the triphosphate providing the energy for addition of a new nucleotide would be on the DNA strand that is extended, and not on the newly added nucleotide. <\/p>\n\n<p>One disadvantage of this approach is that nucleotide triphosphates spontaneously hydrolyze under aqeuous conditions. This is no significant problem for the 5'-3' polymerase, as the triphosphate is on the new nucleotide and the polymerase just has to find a new nucleotide. For the 3'-5' polymerase spontaneous hydrolysis is a problem because the triphosphate is on the growing chain.

I know this may be too late now, but I was noseying around and spotted it, so I'll take a stab nonetheless. I could be wrong, but I suspect what you're seeing here may be an extracellular representation of an action potential (and/or it could be a filtering artefact, see below). From the video on the spikerbox website, it looks like you place the electrodes (nails?) into the animal and hope to get close to axons and see spiking activity. Correct me if I'm wrong.<\/p>\n\n<p>From a brief reading of the literature it would appear, under optimal conditions, the waveform of the extracellular action potential (EAP) is dependent on the cell type and location of the electrode along the neuron (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467426\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> paper illustrates this nicely). As you move away from the soma and down the axon/dendrites, you tend to see this more prominent initial spike, as you see in your recordings. This is due to the ionic conductances and timings of channel openings. So that's one possible explanation...<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oaoRE.png\" alt=\"Extracellular spike with filters\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the other: the signal is filtered in some way. I notice in your figure your signal is very smooth without any noise and your EAP very long (assuming your x axis is seconds), which suggests to me your acquisition rate is quite low and/or being filtered. I've attached an image of an EAP I acquired (from a cell soma) a while back (with an acquisition rate of 10Khz, i.e. I 'sampled' the signal 10000 times per second to get the trace). They're all the same EAP on the same scale with different types of filters applied. The original signal is the one on the left; note all that baseline noise. The middle one is a low pass filter of 2KHz (gets rid of signals higher than that). The right hand one is a 750 - 1000 Hz band pass filter. This type of filter does funky things to signals if used incorrectly (such as in this example!). It basically only allows signals within a given region and gets rid of signals outside of it. What you end up with is the signal on the right, which looks suspiciously like yours!<\/p>\n\n<p>So I'd hazard a guess and say it's a problem due to how the system collects and filters data. BUT, there could be a biological basis for it too.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is one thing that does confuse me, and that is the polarity of your waveform. I would normally expect the prominent point of your EAP to be pointing downward. I have two suggestions as to what may be the cause of this: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You're actually measuring currents here; the units for your Y-axis would help answer that one.<\/li>\n<li>Some grounding issue.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":21199,"question_id":14077,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14077/confused-at-what-is-happening-with-these-action-potentials","last_activity_date":1410397478,"creation_date":1387516833,"answer_count":2,"title":"Confused at what is happening with these action potentials","body":"<p>Ok so for a bit of a background, I am doing a science project looking at the action potentials of the earthworm.

Though long, I cannot cover the depth of the topic of sleep but I tried to address the issues asked in the original question while broadly highlighting various aspects about sleep research. I welcome any suggestions for improvement.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is sleep?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To know what it means to be awake, you must know what it means to be in a state of sleep. These are two alternative states for animals that sleep. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finding a concise scientific definition of sleep is difficult, probably because sleep is a very complex process. For example, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40834254_The_memory_function_of_sleep/file/d912f5032417709272.pdf\">Diekelmann and Born (2010)<\/a> state that,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and later<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sleep is characterized by the cyclic occurrence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, which includes slow wave sleep (SWS, stages 3 and 4) and lighter sleep stages 1 and 2....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most attempts to explain what sleep is include the four stages of sleep along with REM (rapid eye movement sleep). The stages are nicely explained by this National Institutes of Heath website on <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm\">Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep<\/a>. Each stage of sleep can be identified by specific types of brain waves, shown below (image from <a href=\"http://bama.ua.edu/~sprentic/large101%20outline-sleep.htm\">here<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M3eNt.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Notice that the first wave pattern is characteristic of being awake.  The wave patterns change as an individual becomes drowsy and then falls asleep. While asleep, the brain cycles through the different stages, each with its characteristic brain waves.  Associated with these stages are changes in metabolic activity and physical capabilities. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm\">Brain Basics<\/a> site notes that we become less responsive to external stimuli and metabolic activity slows. During REM, breathing becomes rapid and we can't move the muscles in our arms or legs. Similar states are found in other invertebrate and vertebrate organisms, which suggests that these are common indicators of sleep or a sleep-like state. Some examples of these states are given in the citations and links below.<\/p>\n\n<p>Defining \"awake\" seems just as difficult as defining \"asleep\" but once again neural activity seems to be key indicator. As shown in the figure above, being awake has characteristic wave patterns in the brain that are distinct from the wave patterns associated with sleep. In addition, none of the physiological/physical states associated with sleep stages are present when you are awake.<\/p>\n\n<p>In both cases, asleep and awake, the indicators seem to be based on characteristic neurological activities in the brain or, in the case of some invertebrtes, the organized nervous system.  This interpretation is important when considering whether organisms without any type of nervous system is capable of sleep or the alternate state: awake.  More on this at the end.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why sleep?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Science magazine, in the 125th anniversary issue, made a list of 125 big questions that remain to be answered by scientists. One of those questions was \"Why do we sleep?\" The role of sleep remains elusive but many ideas have been put forth about the role of and the evolution of sleep. The leading idea seems to be memory consolidation. This article by <a href=\"http://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Kavanau/OriginEvolutionSleep.pdf\">Kavanau (1997)<\/a> reviews ideas about the function of sleep and why it evolved.  He suggests that sleep and memory evolved as as ways to improve or maintain effective connections among the nerve cells in the brain. Some circuits are used frequently, such as those used to process sensory information like vision. Other circuits are used less frequency, such as circuits that can be used to store memories. Sleep may allow those infrequently used circuits to be activated and used without causing conflict with the circuits used during \"restful waking.\" In other words, sleep may allow the lesser used circuits to be exercised, which can help to consolidate memories. So, at least one function of sleep may be to help maintain efficiency in how information is moved around the brain by maintaining the brain circuitry.  See also this review by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7063/full/nature04285.html\">Siegel (2005)<\/a> and the previously mentioned article by Diekelmann and Born (2010).<\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/scibytes/got_sleep\">Scitable article<\/a> has a nice overview of the importance of sleep for humans, as does the <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm\">Brain Basics<\/a> site. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What organisms sleep or have sleep-like activity?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Sleep has been well-studied in vertebrates, from fishes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1644087/pdf/procrsmed00350-0073a.pdf\">(Marshall 1972)<\/a> to mammals <a href=\"http://www.mb.mahidol.ac.th/neuroscience/intranet/2011/Allan%20Hobson_The%20Neurobiology%20of%20Sleep.pdf\">(Pace-Schott and Hobson 2002)<\/a>. However, not all vertebrates necessarily sleep <a href=\"http://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Kavanau/VertebratesNeverSleep.pdf\">(Kavanau 1998)<\/a>. For example, continuously swimming fishes like some sharks and blind cave fishes may not sleep. These are just three references of <em>many<\/em> about sleep in vertebrates. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sleep and sleep-like activity has not been as well studied in inertebrates. As noted in <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/21159/8517\">this thread<\/a>, there is evidence for sleep in at least some insects. Cephalopods like octopuses show signs of sleep <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810006001504\">(Mather (2008)<\/a>. <em>Caenorhabditis elegans<\/em>, a nematode worm and model biological system, shows sleep-like states tht are similar to mammals and fruit flies <a href=\"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~bi250c/papers/Raizen%20et%20al%202008.pdf\">(Raizen et al. 2008)<\/a>. The most basal organism that shows evidence of sleep-like patterns is a jellyfish called <em>Chironex fleckeri<\/em> <a href=\"http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Class/Psy355D/jellyfish.pdf\">(Kavanau 2006)<\/a>. Cnidarians like jellyfishes are the basal (most \"simple\") group of organisms with an organized nervous system. Interestingly, <em>C. fleckeri<\/em> process a lot of visual information obtained through their 24 eyes. Twelve of the eyes are simple, light-receiving structures but 8 of the eyes are camera-like, meaning they have a lens.  Kavanau (2006) argued that sleep (up to 15 hours) in this jellyfish allows time for its simple nervous system to process the visual information obtained while it is awake. The presence of sleep-like activity in jellyfish and nematode worms suggest that sleep is an evolutionarily ancient phenomenon. <\/p>\n\n<p>This Wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(non-human)\">sleep in non-humans<\/a> overviews evidence for sleep in vertebrates and invertebrates. It's not clear whether androids sleep or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F\">what they dream about<\/a> if they do sleep.$^1$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do single-celled organisms sleep?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is (to me) a tricky question. Sleep is associated with specific types of neural activity in the brain or nervous system. In addition, sleep-like neural activity has been found in diversity of organisms with some type of nervous system, and seems evolutionarily old. I therefore think that any organism that has some form of organized neural center (brain, brain-like organ or centralized nervous system) has the potential to show some type of sleep-like patterns. <\/p>\n\n<p>In contrast, organisms lacking any type organized nervous system would not be capable of sleep, at least as currently defined. If they do not sleep, then they also cannot be awake because being \"awake\" seems to be recognized as neural activity not typical of sleep.  Therefore, it seems to me that single celled organisms like bacteria and paramecium are neither sleeping nor awake.  Plants are neither sleeping nor awake. They are metabolically active but they are neither asleep nor awake because they do not have any type of neural activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not a sleep researcher (but sometimes I am a sleepy one) nor am I a neurophysiologist. I just walked through my train of thought. I welcome contrary views along with the supporting science.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature Cited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Diekelmann, S. and J. Born. 2006.

In 1828 Frederick Wöhler synthesised urea (CO(NH<sub>2<\/sub>)<sub>2<\/sub>) which is often taken as the first demonstration that the organic v inorganic distinction was not a sound one (for more on this see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6hler_synthesis\">Wikipedia article on Wöhler synthesis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as we know all essential human nutrients can be synthesised from inorganic ingredients, even complex molecules such as Vitamin B<sub>12<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other contributors have pointed out that organic pathways for synthesising our food have evolved over long periods to be very efficient - at least in the conditions prevailing on Earth. You haven't ruled out copying biochemical pathways using chemicals that are entirely of inorganic origin. Anyone trying to do this seriously could create glucose (for example) by artificially creating enzymes (perhaps via artificial DNA) to do the job. The thing is that we already have self-replicating and repairing machines to do that already (plants).<\/p>\n\n<p>There might be circumstances when we needed to use artificial synthesis. I can think of two science-fiction stories that deal with this question, the first of which goes into some detail:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_Hell!\">The Moon is Hell<\/a> by John W. Campbell, in which astronauts are stranded on the moon and forced to make food from what they find there.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Error\">Technical Error<\/a> by Arthur C. Clarke, in which a man is accidentally rotated through the fourth dimension. His employers contemplate the difficulty caused by the \"handedness\" of many biological molecules meaning they would have to artificially synthesise many of his foods.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It may be that a future expedition to Mars (say) might have to think about these things.<\/p>\n\n<p>A little searching fails to come up with standard inorganic syntheses of glucose and similar substances. The reason for this is almost certainly because it is so easy to use organic inputs. Glucose is easily made by the hydrolysis of starch. Starch is very common and cheap. Even l-glucose is usually made out of organically derived precursors (or sometimes even using d-glucose).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: sources etc<\/strong>\nOne problematic question is: where do you get your input for making nutrients? As others have pointed out, exactly where to draw the line is difficult. <\/p>\n\n<p>This problem starts in defining what is alive in the first place. Do you count viruses (which can go down to a few thousand base pairs of RNA) or satellite viruses (STobRV has only 359 base pairs) or prions? In a sense these are \"just\" very large molecules. But then really simple bacteria are not many orders of magnitude more complex. As an aside most systems of ethics that do not permit eating meat do not make an alive/non-alive distinction, choosing some other aspect such as sentience, though Jainism comes close to doing so.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second problem is, if we reject living things as sources of food, how far removed from those living things are we allowed to get? You say no cells in any state including \"dead\". That would exclude (say) fruit even though most fruits are expressly created by plants in order to be eaten (and in some cases must be eaten) - something that vegans, jains, fruitarians and others would be happy with eating. If we could use dead material things would be much easier.<\/p>\n\n<p>But would you also include hydrocarbons (coal, oil, gas) which were once living organisms? If you do, then you are in difficulty because terrestrial carbon is recycled through the biosphere. All CO2 was (to a close approximation) once a part of a living thing. If you take that position then of course you are going to have to go off-planet to find your source chemicals and your problem becomes very much harder.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was assuming that you were restricting yourself to consuming cells that retain some of their cell structure but had not completely degraded. If that is where you draw the line then there are ample sources of raw materials on earth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic modification is much more science fiction though not entirely impossible. Some nutrients could be made by humans without much difficulty. Our inability to manufacture vitamin C is down to one missing enzyme (L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase) which is present in most vertebrates (I think of mammals only guinea pigs, humans and some bats are unable to synthesise it). You could certainly imagine some very careful genetic modification changing humans so they no longer need to consume vitamin C.<\/p>\n\n<p>But photosynthesis would be much harder. Chloroplasts (which do the job in most plants) are really a very primitive form of life living in plant cells which may independently reproduce  (and for that reason might be excluded by you - they aren't \"cells\" but they have membranes). They could easily end up in conflict with our mitochondria (since intracellular conflict between organelles is possible) and you would need to do enormous amounts of work to make human cells co-operate with them properly.<\/p>\n\n<p>More in keeping with your theme would be adding photosynthetic systems directly to human cells along with a suite of enzymes to manufacture all the things we cannot. That is of course in principle scientifically possible (since plants do it) but much harder than it looks. Living systems are very complicated and small changes can have unexpected consequences. Even very minor genetic modifications are problematic. The human autotroph is likely to be some way off.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20664,"question_id":20657,"up_vote_count":54,"last_edit_date":1409006448},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f23bcc7c7375c69e926d68b7bafb40c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":8859,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8859/just-a-thinker","reputation":31,"display_name":"Just A.

What's worse, the macrophages literally catch and eat these bacteria alive, so you are very much \"consuming\" them.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could live in a bubble, but even then there are bacteria in your gut. In your gut, they are not attacked by your immune system, but they can sometimes get through the gut lining into the body, where they <em>are<\/em> attacked. They could also escape from you anus into the environment, and then end up elsewhere in your body.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if you had a magic force field keeping the gut flora inside the space of your intestinal lumen, they could still mutate and <em>become<\/em> immunogenic, then get consumed by your macrophages. Anyhow, collectively, <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/galleries/zen-photo/m/microbiome\">your gut flora has more cells than your body<\/a>, so is it really fair to say \"you\" did not consume any life when this symbiotic bacterial mass living inside you (more like <em>you<\/em> are the parasite living <em>outside it<\/em>) consumes some of its own cells?<\/p>\n\n<p>But let's say you get rid of your gut flora, too. It's a hell of a life, and you wouldn't wish it on your enemy, but it solves that problem. Now only human cells are present inside your bubble. What happens when eventually your cells mutate and you get cancer? There are natural killer cells that will try to consume the cancer. So you have still consumed life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's say you made yourself immune to cancer. That's impossible, but let's say you made your DNA polymerase so high fidelity that it takes millions of years for even a single mutation to occur (this is also almost impossible). Your body still has to kill cells through apoptosis as part of maintaining its own function. Again, to conserve resources, these cells are literally <em>swallowed<\/em>. It's debatable whether an apoptotic cell is alive, but it is <em>made<\/em> to die by influence of other cells, so this is very analogous to killing a chicken and eating it. In principle.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer is no, but your question becomes meaningless if you define \"life\" scientifically. It is only possible to live without consuming life if \"life\" means <em>only plantae, metazoa and fungi<\/em>. But that is not what it means, because at least <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism#Important_constituents\">some Eastern religions<\/a> <em>do<\/em> consider eating microbes to be \"consuming life\".<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Lame, boring answer<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Universe has a finite reserve of (dis)entropy. When that runs out, no more life can exist, because all life must increase entropy. Even on Earth, by simply being alive you are taking up space that could be used by other organisms. To be alive you require some form of energy; even if this energy is solar, you would still be using up energy that could have been used by a plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>By simply existing, you are irreversibly destroying vital resources necessary for other life.

The image below is taken from that document. I modified it slightly by enlarging the $s$ and $s'$ variables because they are important for this answer. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qFQlD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>For a simple lens like that in our eyes, magnification, $m$, is calculated as <\/p>\n\n<p>$$m= \\frac{s'}{s}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $s'$ is the distance between the lens and the retina at the back of the eye, and $s$ is the distance between the object and the lens. For the human eye, the distance $s'$ is about 24 mm, or just a bit under 1 inch.  For an object to have exactly 1:1 size ratio (no magnification or reduction), it would have to be exactly that same distance from the lens. That is, the object would have to be about 24 mm in front of our eye. The problem is that, unless you are <a href=\"http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/myopia?sso=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">myopic (nearsighted)<\/a>, you cannot focus on objects closer than about 25 cm (about 10 inches)<\/p>\n\n<p>Most objects are much farther away from the lens than 24 mm. That means $s$ is a much larger value than $s'$, making $m$ a fraction less than 1. A value less than 1 means that our lens is not magnifying the object but instead is reducing or demagnifying the object. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a simple experiment, hold your finger upright in front of your eyes at arms length.  Bring your finger closer and closer until you feel your eye lashes. Your finger looks smallest when it is farthest away from your eye. As you bring it closer ($s$ is getting smaller) your finger appears larger and larger. When your finger gets to about 24 mm, then $m=1$. When your finger touches your eye lashes, the distance is less than 24 mm, and the finger is magnified to larger than actual size ($s &gt; s'$ and $m &gt; 1$). <\/p>\n\n<p>This also explains why distant objects appear smaller than closer objects. If you see a stop sign at 500 m and a stop sign at 100 m, the closer sign looks larger than the more distant sign.  But which is the actual size? Neither, because the lens changes the apparent size. The way to see the actual size is to stand with your eye about 24 mm away from the sign. Then, magnification will be exactly 1:1 and you'll know the true size of the sign. You just won't be able to focus on it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21158,"question_id":21153,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21153/does-human-eye-lens-have-a-magnification-of-its-own","last_activity_date":1410264338,"creation_date":1410245228,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does human eye lens have a magnification of its own?","body":"<p>I have always wondered if the lens in our eyes have any sort of magnification by default.
