This area is also of interest to me, hence the protracted answer. <\/p>\n\n<p>The two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, first described by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Alzheimer\">Alois Alzheimer<\/a> in about 1906, are the extracellular <strong>neuritic plaques<\/strong> and the intracellular <strong>neurofibrillary tangles<\/strong> which occur (exclusively) in the brain of humans with this disease.<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Neuritic Plaques (Amyloid Precursor Protein and &beta;-Amyoid)<\/h3>\n\n<p>[References to the information given below may be found in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9530504\">Price &amp; Sisodia<\/a> (1998) and in <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/266/29/19842.full.pdf\">Lowery <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a> (1991)]<\/p>\n\n<p>The major component of the extracellular neuritic plaques is a small, appromimately 4 kDa protein known as the <strong>&beta;-Amyloid (A&beta;)<\/strong>,  or A4-protein.  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The A&beta;, whose tertiary structure is that of a &beta;-pleated sheet, is itself derived by proteolysis (see below) from a much larger protein known as the <strong>Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>A number of isoforms of A&beta; are known which contain between 36 and 43 amino acids, the most common of which are  A&beta;<sub>40<\/sub> and A&beta;<sub>42<\/sub>. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The Amyloid Precursor protein (APP) is a very large protein (&ge; 695 amino acids) of unknown function which is a normal component of brain. It is predicted to have a single transmembrane span. <\/p>\n\n<p>A number of isoforms of this protein are also known, which contain  695, 714, 751 &amp; 770 amino acids. <\/p>\n\n<p>The AA<sub>751<\/sub> and AA<sub>770<\/sub> isoforms contain a domain (Kunitz domain) homologous to a class of protease inhibitors, strongly suggesting the proteolysis plays a key role in normal function, and perhaps in (abberant?)  A&beta; formation. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>One of the cleavages which produces the A&beta;, that catalyzed by &gamma;-secretase, occurs <strong>within the transmembrane-spanning domain<\/strong> of APP.  How the protease has access to its substrate within the lipid bilayer is a major source of interest. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Researchers who believe that neuritic plaques and  A&beta; hold the key to Alzheimer's disease are known as <strong>baptists<\/strong>. Their counterparts, who believe that the neurofibrillary tangles are key, are known as <strong>tauists<\/strong>, for reasons that will become obvious (see also <a href=\"http://www.tangledneuron.info/the_tangled_neuron/2007/01/alzheimers_tang.html\">here<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>For the past number of years, baptists have been to the forefront. In my view, the tauist story is even more interesting, and must surely be important in any final understanding of Alzheimer's disease.<\/p>\n\n<h3> Neurofibrillary Tangles, Paired Helical Filaments and <i>Tau<\/i> Protein<\/h3>\n\n<p>Examination of the neurofibrillary tangles under the electron microscope revealed that they had a twisted ribbon-like structure which was called the <strong>paired helical filament (PHF)<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14188276\">Kidd<\/a>, 1964; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6542129\">Wisniewksi <i> et al.,<\/i><\/a> 1984). <\/p>\n\n<p>PHFs are practically insoluble and for a long time this impared progress.  However, extraction using the detergent sarkosyl, followed by sequence analysis and immunological investigations, produced a  major surprise:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A component of the paired helical filament is the\n  microtubule-associated protein <em>tau<\/em> (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC280359/\">Goedert <i>et al<\/i><\/a>., 1988;\n  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC280541/\">Wischik <i>et al<\/i>.<\/a>, 1988), a most unusual and interesting <em>soluble<\/em> protein\n  which had already been purified to homogeneity and extensively characterized by Kirschner &amp; co-workers\n  (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432646/\">Weingarten <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1975; Cleveland <i> et al<\/i>., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/599557\">1977a<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/146092\">1977b<\/a>). <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A perusal of pubmed shows that at this stage interest in <em>tau<\/em> increased dramatically!<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is now accepted that microtubule-acssociated protein <em>tau<\/em> <strong>in a\n  hyper-phosphorylated state<\/strong> is the major structural component of the\n  paired helical filament (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1899488\">Lee <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1991; Kosik &amp; Greenberg, 1994).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Some key properties of <em>tau<\/em> are the following.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tau<\/em> was first isolated as  a series of closely related proteins (isoforms) which co-purify with porcine tubulin during successive cycles of polymerization/depolymerization (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432646/\">Weingarten <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1975).  On an SDS gel, one sees (with bovine brain <em>tau<\/em>) 4 bands quite close together from (say) 58 - 64 kDa.<\/li>\n<li>Interaction with tubulin is the only known 'normal' function of <em>tau<\/em>.  It promotes the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules under polymerization conditions, for example (Cleveland <i> et al<\/i>., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/599557\">1977a<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/146092\">1977b<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li><em>Tau<\/em> is encoded by a single gene, located on chromosome 17, and differential mRNA splicing gives rise to the brain isoforms (six in humans and four in cow) [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1420178\">Andreadis <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1989; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2484340\">Goedert <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1989; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC362555/\">Himmler<\/a>, 1989], and a single high molecular weight <em>tau<\/em> ('big <em>tau<\/em>') in peripheral tissues (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC48578/?tool=pmcentrez\">Goedert <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1992).  <\/li>\n<li><em>Tau<\/em> contains a series of imperfect amino-acid repeats, located in the C-terminus of the protein.

(experiments done in mice) (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8202139\">Harada <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1994).  <\/li>\n<li>Mutations in the <em>tau<\/em> gene are <em>not known to cause<\/em> Alzheimer's disease, but <em>are<\/em> associated with very rare 'taupathies', such as an inherited dementia called frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17; possibly identical with Pick's disease) [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9641683\">Hutton <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1994].  <\/li>\n<li>The crystal structure of <em>tau<\/em> has not been obtained to date.

As stated above, the field of Alzheimer's disease is very complex<\/p>\n\n<p>An allele of Apolipoprotein E (&epsilon;4 allele) is <em>genetically<\/em> associated with an increased risk in late-onset Alzheimer's, for example (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8346443\">Corder <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1993).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations in the presenilin genes are also associated with the disease (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7596406\">Sherrington <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 1995).  Presenilins form part of the &gamma;-secretase protease complex involved in A&beta; formation (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Takeo%2C%20K%2C%20Watanabe%2C%20N%2C%20Tomita%2C%20T%2C%20Iwatsubo%2C%20T.\">Takeo <em>et al<\/em>.<\/a>, 2012). <\/p>\n\n<p>I do not know enough about these fields to comment any further (although this does not usually stop me). <\/p>\n\n<p>It should be emphasized, however, that most cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, and only a small subset has a genetic component. It is a disease of the brain, and of aging. There is no known cure, no known cause and no reliable (biochemical) pre-mortem test (although a clinic diagnosis may of course be made). <\/p>\n\n<p><hr/>\n<strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Andreadis, A., Brown, W.

In many of the papers I will go on to cite, they suggest that prevention of Alzheimer's may be the only cure, as neurons (once damaged) cannot be replaced.<\/p>\n\n<p>During aging there is a progressive increase in the systemic pro-inflammatory state (sometimes called 'inflammaging'). This is also true for the brain (commonly known as neuroinflammation), and is known to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases by promoting the destruction of local tissues (i.e. neurons) [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-1-14\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref<\/a>].<\/p>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances microglia (resident macrophages of the brain) clear any excess protein depositions (plaques), such as Aβ, in much the same way as macrophages respond to carotid plaques (as can occur during cardiovascular disease). With age, the immune system becomes less functional - a process known as immunosenescence - which contributes to the pro-inflammatory state of aging [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16859761\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref<\/a>].<\/p>\n\n<p>As the immune system becomes less functional, the clearance of Aβ deposits is reduced, possibly contributing to the increased plaque deposition [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552234\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref.1<\/a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20002526\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref.2<\/a>]. There is also discussion on whether it is the decreased effectiveness of the blood-brain barrier that allows peripheral (from the blood) immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system, possibly kick-starting the degeneration [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/196698920\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref<\/a>].<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many more factors than this, but this is certainly one that interests me as I can see that individuals will have different responses and predispositions to plaques formation in the first place (i.e. the ApoE risk allele, exposure to certain pathogens over the lifetime).<\/p>\n\n<p>I therefore don't think the study rules out the amyloid hypothesis, in that removal Aβ does not restore the lost neurons (did they really expect it to?).

Tyr32 is located three amino acids upstream of a threonine (Thr35 in Ras) which is extremely conserved in most G domains.

The Tyr32\u2013&gamma;-thiophosphate distance is 7.2 Å. The conformation of switch I and II and their interaction with the nucleotide are otherwise identical. Thus, the Tyr32\u2013&gamma;-phosphate hydrogen bond forms only in the presence of the true ligand, but is probably not essential for the triphosphate conformation of Rap2A nor for proper binding of the nucleotide.

The Rap2A\u2013GTP and Rap2A\u2013GTP&gamma;S complexes are otherwise identical, and form isomorphous crystals. Thus, the interaction of Tyr32 with GTP&gamma;S is prevented solely by the presence of the gamma-sulfur, but the conformation of switch I and II is similar whether GTP or a GTP analogue is bound. <strong>GTP&gamma;S probably introduces a different charge distribution on the gamma-(thio)-phosphate and/or modifies the polarizability of the &beta;\u2013&gamma; P\u2013O bonds as compared with GTP<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":3260,"question_id":3258,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3258/why-is-gtp-gamma-s-non-hydrolyzable","last_activity_date":1345492060,"creation_date":1345482929,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is GTP gamma S non hydrolyzable?","body":"<p>GTP gamma S is routinely used in studies of G proteins to stably activate the G protein.

Sometimes it can be big - changes in coloration, changes in sensory perception, lifespan, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order for mutations (beneficial or detrimental) to have a significant effect across an entire population, the population itself has to be fairly small or the mutation has to give a large advantage over the old version.<\/p>\n\n<p>Flies are not avoiding motorways because a mutation that specifically codes \"AVOID CARS\" is going to be very unlikely given that it would you would first have to encode what a \"CAR\" is in order to avoid it. That probably won't happen because on the time scale that evolution usually acts over very large populations (which flies have) we won't be driving cars by the time necessary for deaths due to cars has a serious effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Flies have huge populations and breed extremely quickly, so even if a few million are killed by cars, it doesn't put a dent in their population numbers. There's no reason for the change to occur. Combined with the extreme difficulty of actually encoding a gene specific to cars, the odds are it just won't happen in any realistic time-frame.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3217,"question_id":3211,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1345225800,"creation_date":1345225800,"body":"<p>\"in the long run we're all dead men\" - John Keynes<\/p>\n\n<p>First is the fact that flies have adapted their way around cars long long ago by giving up longevity for faster breeding; flies are cheap and they just don't care if they get hit by a car.  The average flying insect lays large clutches of eggs - hundreds at a go is common.  <a href=\"http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/egb/download/bodysize.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">See this reference on butterflies as an example.<\/a>  In table 2 the potential fecundity (FEC) is I believe the number of eggs laid in a lifetime.  The smallest number is 53, the largest is 1500, the average is hundreds.  As long as one or two fly from each lifetime of breeding survives, the species holds on just fine, more and there is a population explosion.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Another side of the question is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It would still be an advantage to be smart and stay off the road wouldn't it?  If they adapt so quickly why doesn't a mutant braniac fly come along that can see the cars and in short order all flies would have this trait... its just selection too, right? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer there is that not everything is available to adaption.   Flies could become that smart, heck maybe even smarter than us, but they have lots of pressure on them from many things they could do well, and their system is already doing many things very well enough for them to survive as they are without making such a large change that might require some short term disadvantages that prevent them from becoming entirely different animals.  The essay \"<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/jerry-fodor/why-pigs-dont-have-wings\" rel=\"nofollow\">why pigs don't have wings<\/a>\" is a pretty good reading for a longer more detailed answer.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Where I live its temperate and there is a good amount of water- lots of food and hospitable for all kinds of plants and animals can thrive here. On the hillsides where updraft currents blow flying insects.  The spiders 'figured this out' and the bushes and trees are often covered with cobwebs on this side of a house.  The flies don't avoid the wind just because so many of them are eaten - they would not themselves be able to mate or eat.<br>\nNote that the spiders haven't become 'smart' - just lucky to have landed in that area.  But then there are many many spiders there that they probably don't get a lot more food than a spider living on the other side of the house who has the only web for a space of several cubic feet. <\/p>\n\n<p>Everything balances itself out in a competitive landscape because there are so many other living things ready to take advantage of a break like this.  Cars just aren't enough to budge the other things the flies have to watch out for.

While this is true, and there are many examples of r\n(ruderal) species evolving rapidly* evolution is not a predictable or\nsensible process, and there are many other factors that contribute to\nevolution other than a short generation time.<\/p>\n\n<p>One main question to consider is\u2026 how many flies are there?  And how\nmuch of that population is affected by the road fatalities?  Whilst\nthere are over 23,000 insect species in the UK, your question\nspecifically concerned flies so\u2026 An average fly lives for around 35\ndays and can lay roughly 750 eggs in her lifetime, so fly numbers are\nbloody huge!  Although a small proportion of flies may be killed by a\ncar, the proportion will be so small as to make no impact to the\noverall population; therefore the driver for evolution is not strong\nenough to have an impact on the species as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another reason why motorway deaths may not have a significant impact\non the fly population is due to when the flies breed.  Even if\nmotorways killed 90% of all flies, the fact that many insects breed\nhours after hatching from their egg means that the population is still\nable to reproduce.  Killing something after it has bred is again not a\ndriver for evolution, it would have to be a very strong force that\nkills a high number of individuals before they have chance to breed.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, motorway deaths affect such a small amount of individuals\nthat it does not have a significant impact upon their populations, I\nimagine that many many more of them get killed in spider webs each\nday, however the idiots are still flying into those too!<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps :)<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>*The peppered moth changed colour from mottled to black due to the\npopulation from the industrial revolution and then to white once the\nair pollution had cleared as the ones that stood out had such a high\npredation rate<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>*in the last 50 years some fish species have evolved a much smaller\nbody size due to the advantage of escaping through a net and being\nable to carry on breeding<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":3255,"question_id":3211,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3211/why-dont-flies-avoid-the-motorway","last_activity_date":1345478156,"creation_date":1345202418,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why don't flies avoid the motorway?","body":"<p>Flies have a short lifespan, therefore evolution should technically happen over a shorter period of time (years).<\/p>\n\n<p>Flies die all the time from getting hit by cars on the motorway.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those flies that don't go near the motorways have a greater chance of reproducing.<\/p>\n\n<p>If this was an advantage (motorway avoidance = not dying), shouldn't more and more flies be avoiding the motorway?<\/p>\n\n<p>Cars have been around since, roughly ~1950.

Mitochondria do have DNA but that mDNA is there to encode proteins for their specific functions (e.g. to create ATP). So, although the mDNA may not be uniform for every mitochondrion in your body, it is most likely functional unless you have a mitochondrial disease.

It's also possible that your mom inherited and passed on to you more than one genetic line (as is the case in viable mitochondrial disease).<\/p>\n\n<p>Mitochondrial repair mechanisms do exist but <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16050976\" rel=\"nofollow\">they differ<\/a> in various ways from nuclear DNA repair and may be more prone to damage.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3249,"question_id":3245,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3245/does-every-mitochondrion-in-a-cell-contain-the-same-dna","last_activity_date":1345404464,"creation_date":1345390180,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does every mitochondrion in a cell contain the same DNA?","body":"<p>I know that mitochondria of eukaryotes have their own DNA, more similar to that of bacteria than to the rest of the cell's DNA. I also know that a cell can have plenty of mitochondria, and I understand each of them has it's own DNA. Is it the same DNA? <\/p>\n\n<p>I know that when a human is conceived, the mitochondria of the sperm are destroyed and don't contribute to the new cell. If there were no mutations and the process started with a cell with homogenous mDNA, that would mean that the mDNA not only within one cell but among all of the descendants was the same. But there are mutations because we have different mDNAs. Then shouldn't the mutations cause variety within single cells? It's hard for me to believe that there can even be a single human cell in the world that has homogenous mDNA because, if I understand correctly, an ovum retains many mitochondria during conception, not just one, so at least some of the variety within the ovum should be passed over to the conceived human. But perhaps it's extremely difficult for a cell with variously DNAed mitochondria to survive? Can it be estimated what the percentage of human cells with homogenous or nearly homogenous mDNA is across the world?<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm asking this because I've heard that the mDNA can be considered another chromosome. I wonder if then every single piece of mitochondrial DNA should be considered another chromosome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that all I know about biology is what I learned in high school several years ago and the bits I know from Wikipedia and other internet sources. I would like to ask for possibly accessible answers.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Reading up on this, I came across the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroplasmy\">heteroplasmy<\/a>. So it does happen that mitochondria of an organism can store different genetic information. But the article seems to suggest that it is an anomaly rather than the normal course of things. That seems strange to me. I understand of course that <em>some<\/em> mutations have to be harmful, but shouldn't some mutations and some kinds of in-cell variety turn out to be neutral or even advantageous?<\/p>\n\n<p>I've also just read that a mitochondrion stores more than one copy of its DNA. That seems to allow for variation even within a single mitochondrion.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: I think it's possible that my question is unclear. There seem to be four levels on which mDNA variety can be considered: a species, an organism, a cell, a mitochondrion. I ask the answerers to focus on the third one. I will be happy to learn about the other levels too and I will consider such information on-topic, but my main question is about what happens in a cell. <\/p>\n","question_id":3245,"tags":["dna","cell-biology","mitochondria","chromosome"],"score":10,"accepted_answer_id":3249,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1364,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1345404464},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e790e2536283d30c63d64a94fe35fbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":250,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/250/magnetar","reputation":293,"display_name":"magnetar","accept_rate":25},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":782,"edited":false,"creation_date":1327356460,"comment_id":866,"body":"I think I read in one of my textbooks that vision likely arose from  photoautotrophs developing a photosensitive spot in their cells.

The definition he gives is one of many which are in current use, and is made redundant by many types of organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to recognise that because reproduction is not the same process in all organisms, genetic differentiation between individuals occurs in different ways for different groups.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's take the definition given in LuketheDuke's answer...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but are not able to breed with members of another species.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Under this definition, lions and tigers (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger\">ligers<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglon\">tiglons<\/a>, which are sterile hybrids between the two) would be considered one species, as would donkeys and horses (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule\">mules<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny\">hinnys<\/a>, again sterile hybrids). There are hundreds of other examples of pairs of animal species which can hybridise to produce sterile offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, these animal hybrids usually only take place with human intervention, by delibrate breeding efforts. Thus we could extend the previous definition to include them...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do not breed freely with members of another species in the wild<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That last part takes care of the ligers and tiglons. But what if we consider plants? Under the definition I just gave, most grasses (around 11,000 species) would have to be considered as one species. In the wild, most grasses will freely pollinate related species and produce hybrid seed, which germinates. You might then think we could just modify the definition to specify that the offspring must be fertile (i.e. able to reproduce with one another)...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do not breed freely with members of another species in the wild to produce fertile progeny<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the situation is still more complicated (we've barely started!). Often wild hybridisation events between plants lead to healthy, fertile offspring. In fact common wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum<\/em>) is a natural hybrid between <strong>three<\/strong> related species of grass. The offspring are able to breed freely with one another.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we could account for this by taking into account whether the populations <em>usually<\/em> interbreed, and whether they form distinct populations...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic category of biological classification, composed of <strong>populations or meta-populations of<\/strong> related individuals that resemble one another, are able to breed among themselves, but <strong>do tend not to breed freely with members of another species in the wild to produce fertile progeny<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This accounts for the grasses, but it still leaves a messy area when you have a hybridisation which establishes - until the hybrid population is segregated away from the parent populations it is unclear whether they still count as the same species.<\/p>\n\n<p>We could probably live with this situation, except for the fact that bacteria refuse to conform to it at all. Bacteria of the same species, or even very different species, can freely transfer genes from one to the other in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation\">conjugation<\/a>, which combined with fission can result in perfectly replicable hybrids. This is such a common occurence that it breaks even the 'tend to' part of the previous definition, and members of a population can be doing this almost constantly, which negates the segregation requirement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Dawkins had a go at defining around this, by stating that...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>two organisms are conspecific if and only if they have the same number of chromosomes and, for each chromosome, both organisms have the same number of nucleotides <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This partly gets around the bacterial problem and means that bacteria which result from conjugation are a new species. Unfortunately under this definition we might as well not ever bother trying to classify bacteria as billions of new species would be created every day - something which the medical profession might have something to say about. This definition would also mean that those with genetic diseases like trisomy 21 are not human. The final nail in the coffin of this attempt is that there are many species, including frogs and plants, which are very certainly considered a single species by taxonomists but which have some variety in the presence of small accessory chromosomes, which occur in different combinations between individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's consider one last option. We now live in the era of genomics where data about genomes of thousands of organisms is accumulating rapidly. We could try to use that data to build a species definition based upon similarity at the nucleotide level. This is often used for bacteria, by considering organisms with less than 97% nucleotide similarity to be different species.<\/p>\n\n<p>The major point I've been trying to make, though, is that species is not a natural concept. Humans need to be able to classify organisms in order to be able to structure our knowledge about them and make it accessible to people trying to link ideas together. But the natural world doesn't care about our definitions. Ultimately the species concept is different for different groups of organisms and will continue to change over time as our analytical methods and the requirements of our knowledge change. Note that I've deliberately skipped over many historical species concept ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p>The direct answer to your horse question is \"it depends how you want to define a horse\".<\/p>\n","answer_id":2708,"question_id":2705,"up_vote_count":22},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da5e3914edcd58b1abd64a38a2cff8a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1153,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1153/barton-chittenden","reputation":131,"display_name":"Barton Chittenden"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1342667419,"creation_date":1342667419,"body":"<p>The story of the ability to interbreed is even more complicated than the ambiguity posed by horses, donkeys, lions and tigers.

Two of the primary types of meristem are the root apical meristem (at the tips of roots) and the shoot apical meristem (at shoot tips)^. Within the shoot apical meristem the plant cells divide and begin to differentiate into different cell types (such as different cells of the leaf, or vascular cells). Later growth (of, say, a leaf) is largely a result of cell expansion (although cell division does <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/1/68.abstract\">still occur<\/a>, but drops off as the leaf expands). Therefore, if you punch a hole in a leaf, it probably won't be filled in because the cells in that leaf have finished growing and dividing.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, as a shoot grows, more meristems are created. These are found in the axillary buds, just above where the leaf meets the stem. The meristems in the axillary buds can grow to form branches. Different plants obviously make different numbers of branches, but there is a common control mechanism known as apical dominance, where the meristem at the tip of the shoot suppresses the growth of the lower axillary buds. This is why a shoot with no branches can be made to grow branches by cutting off the tip (gardeners often do this to make \"leggy\" plants more bushy).<\/p>\n\n<p>All of that was a long explanation to say, no, a plant doesn't normally^^ regenerate in the sense of filling in cells that have gone missing. However, if you cut off a shoot, the next remaining bud might begin to grow and, in a sense, replace the part that was lost. In that case, an existing bud is recruited to form a new branch and replace lost functionality, but I wouldn't say that qualifies as regenerating missing tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>^There are other types of meristem as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>^^If you torture plant cells enough you can force them to become \"stem cells\" and thereby make an entirely new plant, but this is rare in nature.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3163,"question_id":1489,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/can-any-plant-regenerate-missing-tissue","last_activity_date":1344910305,"creation_date":1332164931,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can any plant regenerate missing tissue?","body":"<p>I have not yet found a plant that, when an insect eats a hole in one of its leaves, it can regenerate the lost tissue.

What follows are some general observations and thoughts.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It would not be unusual for the same enzyme from different \nspecies to have different kinetic properties. For example, yeast and \nhorse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (<a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC1/1/1/1.html\">EC 1.1.1.1<\/a>) vary quite dramatically in this regard\n(see below).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>It <i>is <\/i> to be expected that the same \nprotein from different species will have different amino acid sequences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even the sequence of cytochrome C (~104 amino acids), one of the most \nconserved proteins, differs between species. There are 44 amino-acid differences \nbetween human and yeast cyctochrome C, for example (although there is no\ndifference in amino acid sequence between the human and chimpanzee \nproteins) [see Creighton, 1993, p116, quoted below].<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>This fact alone could explain the kinetic variation, but it might be \nvery difficult (and require a lot of work) to pinpoint what differences \nin amino acid sequence (if any) account for the observed differences in \nkinetic constants. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>In the case of hsp104, a quick alignment (out of curiosity) \nof the amino acid sequence of the  <i>Saccharomyces \ncerevisiae<\/i> and <i>Candida albicans<\/i> enzymes showed quite a number of amino acid differences between these obviously homologous proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>I used the \n<a href=\"http://tcoffee.vital-it.ch/cgi-bin/Tcoffee/tcoffee_cgi/index.cgi?stage1=1&amp;daction=TCOFFEE%3a%3aAdvanced\">TCoffee<\/a>\nsequence alignment algorithm (a new version of ClustalW) at the \n<a href=\"http://expasy.org/proteomics/similarity_search_alignment\">xPASy<\/a> server. (I received an alignment score of 98).<\/p>\n\n<p>For the record, the accession numbers used are the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>hsp140 from <i> Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i>, 908 amino \nacids, Accession Number <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAA50477.1\">AAA50477<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>hsp140 from <i>Candida albicans<\/i>, 899 amino acids, Accession \nNumber <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAK60625.1\">AAK60625<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Of course, the observed kinetic differences may not be due to \namino acid sequence differences at all, or may not be \n<i>only<\/i> due to such differences.  Post-translational \nmodification (such as phosphorylation) and differences in quaternary \nstructure are other possibilities.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I notice from <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/269/6/4480.full.pdf\">this \nreference<\/a> (Parsell \n<i>et al<\/i>., 1994)  that hsp104 from \n<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i> forms oligomers in the \npresence of ATP, and this might be very important in any explanation of \nkinetic differences. (My whole knowledge of hsp140 does not extend \nbeyond this excellent paper). <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Yeast and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) are \nhomologues and <a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC1/1/1/1.html\">catalyze an identical reaction<\/a>.  Both also contain zinc.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the yeast enzyme is a \ntetramer, whereas horse liver ADH is dimeric. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another difference worth \npointing out is that <i>in vivo<\/i> yeast ADH functions as \nan aldehyde reductase (making ethanol), whereas liver ADH functions as \nan ethanol dehydrogenase (in alcohol elimination). [I am aware there are\nother isozymes of yeast ADH, which may have different functions]. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As an ethanol dehydrogenase<\/strong>, the yeast enzyme has a \n<i>k<\/i><sub>cat<\/sub> value of 455 \ns<sup>-1<\/sup> (pH 7.05, 25<sup>o<\/sup>C; \n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1177466/?tool=pubmed\">Dickinson &amp; Monger<\/a>, 1973) whereas the horse liver enzyme has a \n<i>k<\/i><sub>cat<\/sub> value (for ethanol \ndehydrogenation) of only 1.67 s<sup>-1<\/sup> (pH 6.0, \n25<sup>o<\/sup>C; Dalziel, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1243656/?tool=pubmed\">1962<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/238/8/2850.long\">1963<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>In the reverse direction, the<i> \nk<\/i><sub>cat<\/sub> for <strong>acetaldehyde reduction<\/strong> is \n3850 \ns<sup>-1<\/sup> for the yeast enzyme (pH 7.05, \n25<sup>o<\/sup>C, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1177466/?tool=pubmed\">Dickinson &amp; Monger<\/a>, 1973), whereas it \nis only 125 s<sup>-1<\/sup> for the liver oxidoreductase (pH \n6.0, 25<sup>o<\/sup>C; Dalziel, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1243656/?tool=pubmed\">1962<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/238/8/2850.long\">1963<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>How can we explain these kinetic differences from an analysis of \nstructure? In my view this is a very tough question.  It may be due to some or all or none of the differences I have highlighted.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Perhaps the question needs to be rephrased as follows: Is there any fundamental \ndifference, at any level, in the catalytic mechanism, or in the form of the enzyme in \nsolution, or in the amino acid sequence, or in the tertiary or quaternary structure, that can reasonably account for the observed kinetic variation? <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Are the differences worth explaining?  Perhaps one needs to go no further than to record the individual variation under rigorously-defined reproducible conditions? <hr/><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Before such questions may be answered, it is important to establish the nature of the observed kinetic differences.  What follows are merely some guidelines, most of which you are probably aware of.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is the velocity versus enzyme plot linear in all cases at both high and low substrate concentrations? That is, in kinetic jargon, is the   <i>&#957;<\/i> vs [E<sub>o<\/sub>] linear?  As the enzyme is known to form oligomers in the presence of nucleotides (see above), this might be an important control.  Does doubling the enzyme concentration exactly double the rate, and does halving the enzyme concentration exactly half the rate (at both high and low substrate concentrations)?<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of an enzyme where the <i>&#957;<\/i> vs [E<sub>o<\/sub>] is often not linear is phosphofructokinase.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I notice you are using a <a href=\"http://www.bjsycy.com/WebEdit/UploadFile/20084392717141.pdf\">coupled assay<\/a> with two coupling enzymes.  What effect does doubling the amount of one and/or both of these enzymes have on the observed rate?  <strong>It should have none<\/strong>, otherwise the assay is not valid. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The substate is ATP.  <strong>Almost certainly, the 'true' substrate for the enzyme is MgATP<sup>2-<\/sup><\/strong> (correct me if I am wrong about heat-shock proteins). How much Mg<sup>++<\/sup> do you have there?  <\/p>\n\n<p>In determining kinetic parameters for ATP-utilizing enzymes one needs to be aware of ionic equilibria during experimental design. Failure to do so may give rise to spurious kinetic effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>A solution containing ATP and Mg<sup>++<\/sup> will contain many ions, probably only one of which is the substrate for the enzyme, and whose proportion will vary with concentration.  It is essential that this is taken into account. The problem and posssible solutions are explained very well by Cornish-Bowden (2003, pp 86 - 89) and by <a href=\"http://www.biochemj.org/bj/159/0001/1590001.pdf\">Storer &amp; Cornish-Bowden<\/a> (1976). <\/p>\n\n<p>One experimental design is to keep the concentration of MgCl<sub>2<\/sub> <strong>in constant excess<\/strong> over total ATP concentration (CB recommends 5mM).  This is an important one.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Are Michaelis-Menten kinetics obeyed in \nall cases? Is there any evidence for substrate inhibition, or substrate \nactivation? <\/p>\n\n<p>Are the double-reciprocal plots (Hanes plot, \nLineweaver-Burk plot, Eadie-Hofstee plot) linear in all cases?.  Non-linearity may be an indicator of kinetic complexity, or of poor experimental design. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you plot the kinetic data for all three enzymes on a single double-reciprocal plot what sort of a pattern do you get?  Competitive? (no \ndifferences in <i>k<\/i><sub>cat<\/sub>, but \ndifferences in Michaelis constants). <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>In comparing enzyme kinetic parameters the Michaelis constant has the big advantage that it is independent of enzyme concentration.  Thus any differences are likely to be 'real' and not due to errors in, say, protein concentration.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But what about <em>V<\/em><sub>max<\/sub>? If, say, you determine that the maximum velocites differ by a factor of 1.4, can you be certain that you are not inadvertently adding slighly more enzyme in the higher case, and that the catalytic constants are in fact identical? <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>As I said above, these are just personal thoughts.  Most you probably already aware of.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><hr/>\n<strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creighton, T.E. (1993) Proteins.

The reason is because cell membranes simply consist of fatty substance that behaves like a solvent for other lipids.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to the specific question about this product, Monovin A. This is a veterinary product and the producer, Laboratórios Bravet, intends it to be injected into animals in case of a vitamin A deficiency. The main ingredients is a retinol ester in the amount of 2,000,000 IU (which usually means retinol equivalents in this respect).[1]<\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, retinol is a lipid and long-chain esters like retinol esters are non-polar, too, and can readily be de-esterified by esterases, making vitamin A (=retinol, retinal, retinyl palmitate, retinoic acid) immediately available to the surrounding cells and, via transport in the blood stream, to the liver, which is the body's store for it. Daily doses of 25,000 IU are known to be toxic when administered over a long time. Doses of 50,000 IU can be dangerous over weeks. In general, it appears that single high doses are better tolerated than long over-exposure.[2][3] So, do the math and dilute the stuff such that you get at most one hundredth of an ampoule, else...<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the effects. Indeed, hair loss is one of the symptoms of heavy vitamin A-deficiency, and logically, that symptom can be cured with vitamin A. That does not mean that more results in more. While retinoids are important therapeutic agents for the management of many skin diseases, notably acne vulgaris, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and palmoplantar keratoderma, there exists something like <strong>retinoid-induced effluvium<\/strong> which is a side effect of such medication with tretinoin (ATRA).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Retinoid-induced hair loss (telogen effluvium) is among the most\n  frequent and psychologically most distressing adverse effects of\n  retinoid therapy, which results in premature termination of a\n  clinically desired and often highly effective systemic therapy with\n  retinoids.[4]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Since ATRA is readily produced from retinal, its concentration would be expected to be up, even if the original stuff was retinyl ester. In summary, I would expect no effect, or even hair loss, for you don't simply put such potent stuff on your head and elsewhere, and have no reaction from the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.bravet.com.br/pr-ceg-monovina.asp\">http://www.bravet.com.br/pr-ceg-monovina.asp<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[2] Vitamin A: Toxicity from Supplements In: Medical Sciences Bulletin 1995; Pharmaceutical Information Associates, Ltd.<\/p>\n\n<p>[3] Hartmann S, Brørs O, Bock J, et al.: Exposure to retinyl esters, retinol, and retinoic acids in non-pregnant women following increasing single and repeated oral doses of vitamin A.

Although there are exceptions (gap junctions, for one), most forms of inter-cellular communication are mediated by chemicals released by one cell and detected by another. You are right that the cues for synaptogenesis are probably localized (the \"spatial condition\"), but I'm willing to bet the farm that those local cues are chemical in nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>A recent paper from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552280\">Kwon and Sabatini (2011)<\/a> shows that local release of the neurotransmitter glutamate is sufficient to cause a functional spine to form.

[<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1218370\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref<\/a>].<\/p>\n\n<p>Fibroblasts are somatic cells - they are the 'normal' cells that make up the vast majority of organsisms. The only cells not known as somatic are gametes/germ cells and stem cells. They thus do not express telomerase, and have a <em>replicative lifespan<\/em>, also known as a Hayflick limit.<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to your question about engineering organs, there are many resident stem cells in tissues (and thus organs) that 'top-up' the somatic cells when required. As organisms age, this pool of stem cells becomes depleted [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/cc.7.24.7214\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref<\/a>]. Artificially engineering an organ such as the heart (I assume this is what you mean) would be inherently difficult, as many vascular cells are not replaced, but can last a whole lifetime - this is also true for many neuronal cells.

In contrast, when a dark/ light square is accompanied\n  by a light /dark line segment, the apparent tilt is the direction of\n  expansion of the square angle (Figure 18c,d).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUKj4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This explains why you perceive a tilt. If you position the smaller squares now in distinct edges of the big squares, you can achieve 2- and 3-dimenional illusions. Here you see a increasing of the tilt due to more smaller squares:  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JHZiF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here you can see that the positioning of the smaller squares is critical to achieve the 3D effect of the orignial bulge effect in your question:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qqsyX.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Notice that <em>Gestalt Psychology<\/em> is a non-reductionistic theory approach and investigates mainly the phenomenology and underlying <em>Gestalt Laws<\/em> of visual perception. How these <em>Gestalt Laws<\/em> developed on a deeper level is a question of neurobiological evolution similar to, \"why have some species of apes color-vision and some not\". The ellipses in the explaining picture above show you, that our cognitive visual machine somehow tries to group divided objects (square and line of same contrast/brightness) in one line and we see a tilt. I'm guessing here, but this is probably due to cognitive brain algorithm that saves things and objects we see and perceive mainly by countor and shapes, rather than pixel by pixel like a computer and digital camera do it, which of course don't perceive any tilt or 3D illusion in any of those trick images :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Read the papers for more explanations and examples, not behind a paywall:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/corner.pdf\">Apparent contraction of edge angles, A Kitaoks, Perception, 1998<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/tiltillusionreview2007.pdf\">Tilt illusions after Oyama (1960): A review.

First an scab is formed as the blood is 'allowed' to clot. A matrix is formed as the platelets adhere to one another, which contracts and 'dries' (forces out the serum) to form a scab. This process clearly happens prior to tissue regeneration/formation to reduce further blood loss.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Fibrinogen<\/h3>\n\n<p>In response to damage to blood vessels a signaling cascade is initated that results in the <em>massive<\/em> production of <strong>fibrin<\/strong>, which is deposited at the site of wounding and subsequently forms blood clots by activating platelets and stabilising the matrix by cross-linking (<a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2006_11/Page1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">see PDB's protein of the month 2006<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So this is why clots do not appear to be attached to the surrounding tissue; the fibrin causes the blood to form a matrix that is very tightly bound to itself.

As they get older they gradually move first to twigs, then to branches and finally back to the main trunk to breed again.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2972,"question_id":2970,"up_vote_count":13}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2970/what-are-the-white-dots-on-the-tree-in-this-photo","last_activity_date":1343030966,"creation_date":1342993107,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are the white dots on the tree in this photo?","body":"<p>Today in <a href=\"http://maps.google.pl/maps?q=55.684575,12.580501&amp;num=1&amp;t=m&amp;z=16\">Kongens Have<\/a>, I noticed a lot of white dots on bark of trees.

But most articles online that attempt to describe it, seem vague to me. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose I fuse the \"bait\" protein to the BD and several different cDNA's to the AD and let the yeast grow. Next, I observe that the reporter gene is expressed. Doesn't this observation only imply that there exists some protein from the cDNA library that interacts with our bait protein? How do we know exactly which of the target proteins have interacted with the bait and resulted in the expression of the reporter gene?<\/p>\n","question_id":2916,"tags":["proteins"],"score":8,"accepted_answer_id":2917,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":180,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/faeeef7d7a44f1007f2832d54f8e7e94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1005,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1005/everyone","reputation":1798,"display_name":"Everyone","accept_rate":57},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e60c4ebf047734e923ffa4ffa45337cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1122,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1122/rwst","reputation":3115,"display_name":"rwst","accept_rate":100},"score":9,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1670879794aed7c23742e5b1f759be94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1136/tomd","reputation":2087,"display_name":"TomD"},"score":1,"post_id":2910,"edited":false,"creation_date":1342462700,"comment_id":4222,"body":"Thanks.

This new regulatory potential needs to be positively selected after it appears, or it will gradually accumulate more mutations and disappear. But if the region is close enough to the coding gene, recombination rate between the region and the nearby gene body will be low, proportional to their distance. If the gene body is assumed under selective constraint, there will be a hitchhiking effect of the nearby regulatory region by the gene nearby. The background levels of mutation on the regulatory region are then going to be lower (lower background mutation) than in a region that is not near a gene under strong selective constraint. So one way of explaining why close promoter/enhancer regions are more conserved than distant enhancer regions would simply be due to linkage. <\/p>\n\n<p>A second part of the hypothesis would be about the presence or absence of recombination hotspots in upstream regions of a coding region: if nearby promoter/enhancers are kept via linkage to the closest gene, unbiased measures of cross-over (e.g. <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/5/957.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">PRDM9 experiments in mouse testis<\/a>) should indicate if there is an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11089.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased linkage of functional genomic blocks<\/a>, like enhancer/promoter/gene blocks (Hi-C, 4C, 3C data), whereas if recombination doesn't play a role, regulatory blocks wouldn't necessarily be kept in the same haplotype block.<\/p>\n","question_id":2852,"tags":["genetics","natural-selection"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":86,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1341998822},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc032d9988e993a4c4b99bbaff48ddaa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":263,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/263/mring","reputation":888,"display_name":"mring","accept_rate":94},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35114dfb827dc71cb3a8ff281617c5b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/535/larry-parnell","reputation":3430,"display_name":"Larry_Parnell"},"score":8,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1334782478,"creation_date":1334782478,"body":"<p>I would not expect this to be any different than other animals - they get the flora from the environment.
