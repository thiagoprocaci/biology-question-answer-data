Li, <a href=\"http://www.dChip.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dChip.org/<\/a>). Array probe data were normalized to the mean expression level of each probe across a sample set. Where indicated, tumors were classified as BLC or non-BLC on the basis of their expression array characteristics, using dChip hierarchical clustering analysis as previously described (Matros et al., 2005 and Wang et al., 2004). Comparisons between results obtained on BLC or BRCA1 tumors, non-BLC tumors, and normal breast samples were performed using the dChip \u201cCompare Sample\u201d function. A threshold of 1.2-fold overexpression in BLC and BRCA1 tumors was applied with 90% confidence. Of 1271 gene probes that map to the X chromosome, 60 satisfied these overexpression criteria with a range of fold difference from 1.35 to 5.11. The false discovery rate (number) of 1000 permutations was as follows: median, 0% (0); 90th percentile, 3.3% (2). Of the 60 probes, 19 were redundant (two or more probes mapping to the same gene) and excluded, leaving 41 gene-specific probes for use in the expression plot of Figure 5B. The complete gene expression array data set is available on the NCBI GEO database (accession no. GSE3744).\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Since this is a standard Affymetrix human genome chip, it's CDF should either be embedded in most packages used to analyse this kind of data (limma is an industry gold standard example ;-), or downloaded from the Afymetrix website.

This material can be quite resistant to homogenization and some lysis buffers. One method I have found to work is to snap-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen (not on dry ice or at -80&deg;C) directly after removal from the animal, or after any sub-dissection you may wish to do. Then, when you are ready to prepare your sample, grind it thoroughly with a mortar and pestle in LN<sub>2<\/sub>, collect the dust and add a good lysis buffer like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioimmunoprecipitation_assay_buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\">RIPA<\/a> at 2-3X concentration, along with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, also at 2-3X. Then, instead of simply homogenizing, use a probe-tip sonicator (not a water bath one) and sonicate the lysate on ice with 8-10 pulses of perhaps 3-5 seconds each, ensuring that the lysate does not heat up too much, and making sure it does not froth up by getting the tip too close to the surface. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonication<\/a> sends very powerful shearing forces through liquid and is excellent at destroying membranes and breaking apart ECM. From here you can do your protein concentration assay (remember to use the same concentration of lysis buffer as your blank), aliquot the lysate and store at -80, or add SDS sample buffer and run your gel.<\/p>\n\n<p>I routinely use sonication on all of my western samples, regardless of whether it's tissue or cell lines I'm dealing with, and I almost never get smeared lanes anymore. Sonication reduces the viscosity or \"thickness\" of the lysate, allowing you to pipette it much more easily and accurately. It is also useful when your sample \"coagulates\" after adding SDS sample buffer, and in this instance it doesn't matter if the sample gets hot, as you'll just be boiling it anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps, please let me know if you're still having problems.

Proteins expressed by the parasite can undergo antigenic variation, meaning that different forms are expressed at different stages of the life cycle, and just as the immune system may be forming a response to one version, it is down-regulated and another takes its place. This is one reason why making a vaccine has proved to be so difficult, as unlike the influenza virus, for example, a single strain of <em>Plasmodium<\/em> can alter its immunogenic appearance and escape <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_response\" rel=\"nofollow\">antigen-specific immune responses<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>While malaria is responsible for a high degree of morbidity - sickness - it is not necessarily fatal except in some cases, frequently when the victims are young, already ill, or are otherwise immune-compromised, or when the infection moves to the central nervous system and the brain. I can't speak from personal experience (fortunately!), but I have been told by numerous friends that malaria is something you want to avoid at all costs. The sickness can last for weeks in some cases, and apparently is quite debilitating at its worst. Brain fever can be deadly, and in many third-world countries and among the poor the lack of good medical care can lead to complications.

The concept behind <em>Mitochondrial Eve<\/em> and <em>Y-Chromosomal Adam<\/em> has to due with cell replication and basic genetics.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Mitochondria<\/strong> (\"Power Generators\" of the cell) are <em>directly<\/em> inherited from mother to daughter cell.

So I, being male, have my Mother's Mitochondria - which the same as my Grandmother's - and the same as my Great-Grandmother's - etc. etc. etc. until you can trace that line back to <strong>\"Mitochondrial Evel\"<\/strong> whose Mitochondria are the origin for all humans on the planet and are inherited <strong>Maternally<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>In <em>that<\/em> sense it is an unbroken lineage of genetic information as inherited <em>from<\/em> mothers, though not exclusive to women.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Y-Chromosomal Adam\"<\/strong> is a similar concept - Women do not have a \"Y\"-Chromosome, so every Y-Chromosome men have today had to originate from somewhere.

The researchers took <em>a lot<\/em> of genes from very divergent populations, and compared them. The researchers were then able to tell which portions were common among all of the Mitochondrial DNA, which had changed the most, and which had changed the least from each other. Using that data, you can construct a rough image of what the originator (or LCA - Last Common Ancestor) had for their own genetic makeup.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can construe a time period because portions of your DNA (either Mitochondrial or Nuclear) acquire/tolerate mutations at an <em>expected rate<\/em> - say 1 mutation every 1.5 Million Years.

The most important one is probably its electronegativity - oxygen 'pulls' electrons much 'stronger' than hydrogen.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics: Reduction potential<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Oxygen is the so-called terminal electron acceptor of the electron transport chain in eukaryotes. You can see \"reduction potential\" as a kind of stored \"energy\" which molecules have, similar to the power stored in batteries (very similar actually). To make this text a bit shorter I'll call it \"RP\" from now on.<\/p>\n\n<p>One maybe confusing detail is that <strong>a substance with low RP has \"more energy\" than a substance with high RP<\/strong>, so it is the opposite way of thinking.<\/p>\n\n<p>In very generalised terms, metabolism means that molecules with a low RP (glucose) are oxidised (burned) and turn into molecules with much higher RP (CO<sub>2<\/sub>). Coupled with this, a different molecule with very high RP (oxygen) is reduced and becomes a molecule with slightly lower RP (H<sub>2<\/sub>O). (You may have heard this before - it's called a redox reaction.) *<\/p>\n\n<p>The important part is that the RP \"released\" by the oxidisation (burning) is larger than the RP \"taken up\" by the reduction. The surplus leaves as energy - heat and light if you just burn the glucose. This is a spontaneous process, meaning it will occur just by itself - even if it takes a <em>long<\/em> time if nobody drops a match on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea of metabolism is to let that process happen - but use as much of the energy it releases as possible. This works by not just letting it burn, but intercepting that burning process at different stages so that at each step a bit of the RP can be taken off and stored in something else. This \"something else\" is NAD which I'm sure you've encountered before. Each step that glucose is burned down, another bit of NADH is made, which then has a respectable reduction potential.<\/p>\n\n<p>NADH (leaving out NADPH here which is a bit different) is channeled into a process called oxidative phosphorylation which retrieves the reduction potential in an actual form of energy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics: Terminal electron acceptor<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the reduction potential I've been talking about all the time is really just electrons, involved in bonds which are \"happy\" to react. Passing down the reduction potential as I've explained is really a passing down of electrons into more and more stable, less reactive bonds. That's why it's called \"electron transport chain\". At the end of oxidative phosphorylation, those electrons are dropped onto O<sub>2<\/sub> and make it into H<sub>2<\/sub>O. That's why O<sub>2<\/sub> is called the \"terminal electron acceptor\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Hydrogen can't replace Oxygen<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Now to come back to why hydrogen cannot perform oxygen's function in our body. We use glucose as our source of reduction power and oxygen as our terminal electron acceptor. O has a high electronegativity (3.5) so it pulls electrons strongly towards it. H's electronegativity is only 2.1, so it's much weaker. O as a terminal electron acceptor works because it pulls them much stronger than H when they bond, so an O-H bond is almost like giving oxygen an electron. In order for hydrogen gas (H<sub>2<\/sub>) to perform the same function, it would need to be possible to drop electrons onto hydrogen in a bond where it pulls them much stronger than the other partner. They do exist, and such compounds are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydride\" rel=\"nofollow\">hydrides<\/a>. But the catch is: unlike H<sub>2<\/sub>O, these are normally strong reducing agents, meaning that hydrogen would rather not be in that bond. This not a feasible option for cell respiration, at least in humans, because it requires a lot of RP input. Making oxygen into H<sub>2<\/sub>O does <em>not<\/em> require a lot, it's a very cheap electron acceptor.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope I was able to put this in understandable terms. Let me know if I need to clarify anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>--<\/p>\n\n<p>*It works with other molecules than glucose->CO<sub>2<\/sub> / O<sub>2<\/sub>->H<sub>2<\/sub>O too, many prokaryotes do that and in fact that's how batteries work<\/p>\n","answer_id":2092,"question_id":2091,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1360625491},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1336300886,"creation_date":1336279087,"body":"<p>I would say that while you could not just replace oxygen with hydrogen and expect life to just go on normally, it's possible for living things to be energetically provided for by H<sub>2<\/sub> if it were found in the environment in enough plenty.

Its really useful thing to know about the crystal in practice.  You can always pretend that any crystal is space group P1 - with no internal symmetry.  This implies half of the diffraction data is needed to get a complete set.  Why half? The Laue symmetry of typical X-ray diffraction shows that the diffraction should be centrosymmetric  I(hkl) = I(-h,-k,-l).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you do this and the crystal has more symmetry than that you are collecting too many data.  Here I take the example of a 2-fold axis.  Along that axis the space group shows that the symmetry of the crystal should be 4 fold along the x axis (x axis is chosen by convention):<\/p>\n\n<p>I(hkl) = I(-h,-k,-l) (as above) and I(hkl) = I(h,-k,-l) <\/p>\n\n<p>This fact means we actually can collect less data and know the crystal diffraction pattern easily.  In practice we collect from more than just the unique data, but the more diffraction data we take it also means that we can assume equivalence and have taken more  measurements, giving us better experimental accuracy for the same effort. It also means that when we build a molecular model for structure in the crystal we have a simpler model - one only creates a model for the unique assymmetric unit of the crystal unit cell. Fewer atoms in the structure, fewer degrees of freedom and less error in our resulting model.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's more... screw axes 2(1), 3(1) and non primitive lattices create systematic absences which helps us collect more accurate data and do refinement more easily in the same vein...  but maybe this gives you an idea...<\/p>\n\n<p>2) how does the unit cell contents reflect the diffraction intensities<\/p>\n\n<p>X-ray scattering from crystals is the result of the photon causing an elastic scatter from atomic, inner shell electrons - Bragg scattering.  By considering the crystal as a series of slits in 3 dimensions, it can be shown that the average positions of atoms in the crystal reinforce each other to give the reciprocal lattice that is diffraction data in 3D.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nhCNY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In the picture above from Wikipedia you can see a beautiful protein crystal diffraction pattern.  The rings of spots are a spherical section from a 3D orthorhombic lattice of spots.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Rather than digress into the reason the diffraction appears this way, back to your question: what causes the intensities to vary from spot to spot and crystal to crystal.  The crystal lattice contains atoms which are in the same position in every unit cell which are creating the diffraction by Bragg scattering.  As such, <em>it is the positions, relative electrons in orbit that dictate the diffraction intensities measured<\/em>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The models built to model diffraction typically translate a set of atomic positions to the structure factors (square roots of the diffraction intensities), but this is an approximation that works pretty well - the full model is not atomic positions, but an electron density function in space.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are other sorts of scattering methods, more that could be said about all these subjects, but I hope that gives you some help with your specific questions.

Illumina is the most frequently used one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Roche/454 FLX Pyrosequencer technology is based on pyrosequencing method, which utilizes the use of the enzymes ATP sulfurylase and luciferase. After the incorporation of each nucleotide by DNA polymerase, a pyrophosphate is released, which further takes part in downstream light-producing reactions. The amount of light is proportional to the incorporated number of nucleotides. The DNA is fragmented and adapters are ligated at both ends. The fragments are mixed with agarose beads, which carry adapters complementary to the library adapters, and thus each bead is associated with a unique DNA fragment. The beads and DNA fragments are isolated in individual micelles, where emulsion PCR takes place and million copies of the single fragments are amplified  onto the surface of each bead. Each bead is placed in a well of picotiter plate (PTP), as the wells have dimensions such that only one bead can fit per well. Enzymes are added to the beads and pure nucleotide solutions are added with an immediate imaging step. On one side of the array a CCD (charge-optic device) camera records the light emitted from each bead. The first four nucleotides (TCGA) are the same as the start of the adapter, which allows for the emitted light to be calibrated according to the type of nucleotide added. The major disadvantage of this method is the misinterpretation of homopolymers (consecutive nucleotides, e.g. AAA or CCC). Such areas are prone to insertions or deletions, as the length of the stretch can be inferred only by the intensity of the light emitted. On the other hand, substitution errors are very unlikely. The 454 FLX instrument generates ~400 000 reads per instrument-run, as the reads are 200-400bp. The greatest advantage of this platform is the read length, which is the longest of all second generation technologies. Although sequencing on 454 platform is more expensive than sequencing on Illumina platform (40USD per Mega base versus 2USD per Mega base), it could still be the best choice for de novo assembly or metagenomics applications. (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).<\/p>\n\n<p>Illumina is the most frequently used one. The DNA to be sequenced is fragmented into about 200 base strands. Adapters are ligated onto the ends of the fragments and one of these adapters is hybridized on a flow cell. Illumina essentially utilizes a unique \"bridged\" amplification reaction that occurs on the surface of the flow cell. Localized PCR reaction is performed, and each of the hybridized pieces of DNA will get locally amplified to generate clusters which will have the exact same molecule. Subsequently, the DNA sequence is determined by adding a primer on one of the ends of the molecule. A mixture of modified nucleotides is added. Each one of them carries a base-specific fluorescent label attached to it. Also, each one has the 3' OH group blocked which ensures the incorporation of one nucleotide at a time.  The flow cell is placed under a microscope and when light is shined on its fluorescence, the emission light shows which base was incorporated on each one of those clusters. The Illumina read length is approximately 35 bases, but over billion reads are generated at a time. The major error type is substitution, rather than deletion or insertion (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).<\/p>\n\n<p>The SOLiD platform utilizes the use of DNA fragmented library, which is flanked by ligated adapters. The fragments are attached to small paramagnetic beads and emulsion PCR is performed to amplify the fragments. In contrast to the other sequencing platforms, sequencing by synthesis is performed by utilizing DNA ligase, rather than polymerase. Each cycle of sequencing involves the ligation of a degenerate population of fluorescently labeled universal octamer primers. A specific position of the octamer (e.g., base 5) carries a fluorescent label. After ligation, images are acquired in four channels, followed by cleavage of the octamer between positions 5 and 6, removing the fluorescent label. After several rounds of octamer ligation, which enable sequencing of every 5th base (e.g., bases 5, 10, 15, and 20), the extended primer is denatured. Different primers can be used to examine the previous or next positions (e.g., base 3 or 6).  The platform can use primers which carry two adjacent correlated with label bases. This approach involves the examination of the bases twice in a cycle, which decreases the error rates. SOLiD read lengths are 25-35 bp, and each sequencing run yields 2\u20134 Gb of DNA sequence data (Mardis, E., 2008, Shendure, J. and Ji, H., 2008).<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mardis, E., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18576944\">Next generation DNA sequencing methods.<\/a> Ann.

Shame on them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The canonical form of the Nernst equation, for an ion $S$ is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\nE_{S} = \\frac{RT}{z_{S}F}\\ln{\\frac{[S]_{out}}{[S]_{in}}}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature expressed in Kelvin, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $z_S$ is the charge of ion $S$. This is the actually useful form of the equation that can be used for any ion for any temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Nernst equation is a limiting case of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for a single ion. The Nernst equation is useful for directly determining the <em>equilibrium potential<\/em> of a single ionic species. The GHK equation is used for determining the <em>reversal potential<\/em> of a membrane or channel in multi-ion cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the terms \"reversal potential\" and \"equilibrium potential\" are not synonymous, except in the case of a single ion system. The reversal potential is where the direction of current switches. An equilibrium is when net ion flux is zero (although, in a living cell, it is more appropriate to call even this situation a <em>steady state<\/em>). If membrane were only permeable to one ion, the reversal potential will be at the equilibrium potential (given by Nernst) for that single ion. However, when there are several permeant ions, usually none of the ions will be in equilibrium at the reversal potential--that is, all the ions will have a measurable flux across the membrane even though the sum of those fluxes (weighted by permeabilities) is zero at the reversal potential.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Converting natural log to log base 10, you can use the identity $\\log_b{a} = \\frac{\\log_{10}{a}}{\\log_{10}{b}}$, which gives<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\nE_{S} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}{e}} \\cdot \\frac{RT}{z_{S}F}\\log_{10}{\\frac{[S]_{out}}{[S]_{in}}}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of sodium ions (Na+) at 37 degrees (physiological temperature), $T$ is 310 and $z_S$ is +1.

It is a wonderful exercise to derive the Nernst equation from the Boltzmann equation,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\exp{(-\\frac{u_2 - u_1}{k_BT})}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $p_i$ is the probability of a particle being in state $i$, and $u_i$ is the energy of state $i$.

The degree to which each contributes ultimately depends on the demands of the sport.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an example let's compare basketball and golf.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basketball is likely to have a strong genetic component because players tend to be exceptionally tall (average is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_league_average_height,_weight,_age_and_playing_experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 2 metres<\/a> and there are only a handful who have played NBA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shortest_players_in_National_Basketball_Association_history\" rel=\"nofollow\">under 1.75m<\/a>). Because height is strongly genetically (but not entirely) determined by the genes, they have a big influence on whether someone can poses the physical qualities to play in the NBA. However, a large part of their technical capabilities are due to their environment. If you give a basketball to someone who has played 2 games a week their entire lives and ask them to take 10 shots it is likely they would score more than someone who has never seen a basketball!<\/p>\n\n<p>Comparing basketball to golf, there are all sorts of body types within the PGA tour, and they is no/few obvious genetic traits which golfers tend to have over other people. This would suggest that golfing ability is more affected by environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>So an easy way to get a rudimentary test of genetic contributions to sporting ability would be to compare frequency distributions of focal traits in the athletes to distributions of regular people. Obviously the phenotypic trait you measure has both genetic and environmental contributions (e.g. childhood diet) which could affect them but it would be a good starting indicator which could give some candidate traits to test. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a scientist I would also consider sequencing some athletes and some non athletes and seeing which genes the athletes have more often then the regular person's genome. However, such studies are likely to be complex - linking phenotypes (in polygenic traits) to the single allele variants relies on large sample sizes. Generally it will be more difficult if:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is large variance in the trait<\/li>\n<li>The gene has a small effect (see major and minor effect genes)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Both of these problems going to be positively correlated with the number of genes affecting a trait (how polygenic is it?) which for athletic ability is probably quite a substantial amount of genes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong>  Here are some possible studies for your further exploration of the topic-<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Abstract/2001/01000/Specific_Genetic_Markers_of_Endurance_Performance.4.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Candidate genes for Specific Genetic Markers of Endurance Performance and o2max<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004390050781?LI=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rowers have an excess of the ACE I allele<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648472\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elite Italian footballers with \"explosive\" leg strength also reveal ACE and other genetic markers<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255226/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A precautionary tale about Genetic tests for athletic ability<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":5165,"question_id":3165,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1360148242},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Clpiv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":349,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/349/knb","reputation":206,"display_name":"knb"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":7083,"edited":false,"creation_date":1360140127,"comment_id":8657,"body":"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255226/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255226<\/a> - talking about genetic tests like the one for ACTN3 &quot;this is a gross over-simplification of the science, according to many critics of these types of consumer genetic tests, including Timothy Caulfield, a Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Technology. \u201cThere are so many factors that contribute to something as complex as performance in sports that it seems ridiculous to narrow it down to this one type of genetic test,\u201d he says.&quot;"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":7083,"edited":false,"creation_date":1360140647,"comment_id":8658,"body":"so I&#39;d suggest we can&#39;t call it a comprehensive test - individual loci only have minor effects on the overall ability."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Clpiv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":349,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/349/knb","reputation":206,"display_name":"knb"},"score":0,"post_id":7083,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"edited":false,"creation_date":1360141097,"comment_id":8659,"body":"@rg255: What the law school professor said is &quot;I don&#39;t like questions like this narrowed down to 1 genetic test&quot;.

For example, differences in the\n  relative proportion of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fiber are\n  thought to have a heritability of about 45%. Although it is not yet\n  clear whether ACTN3 genotype affects this proportion, it has been\n  shown that the SNP in ACTN3 that we report accounts for about 2.3% of\n  the variation in sprinting performance. However, at the molecular\n  level, whether you have 0, 1, or 2 working copies of alpha-actinin-3\n  is highly heritable. Lastly, muscle fiber only contributes a small\n  part to your overall athletic performance. Other physical\n  characteristics, such as lung capacity, and behaviors, such as regular\n  exercise, also make important contributions to your prowess in sports.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is considered \"<a href=\"https://www.23andme.com/res/pdf/trmm3vmfI1BU5d3Qw_qlGg_23-03_Vetting_Genetic_Associations_2010_06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">established research<\/a> for 1 reported marker\".

I can easily imagine how, for example, the giraffe has evolved to its current appearance: the natural selection was favoring individuals that could consume more vegetable food from trees using longer necks, and some individuals were getting at birth necks longer than average by pure genetic randomness and the long neck trait was being propagated to descendant individuals by means of genetic inheritance. I have no problem with understanding this kind of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's have a look at the bat and its relatives. The bat is one of the few mammals that have something to do with flying and the only one that took flying to the bird level. Paleontologically, first mammals date to the dinosaur era and initially looked similar to the present-day shrew (which looks much like a mouse). The question is: how in the world prehistoric mouse-like creatures could grow wings over time?

This might imply that neurons are light reactive.  Compare that to that of medium wavelength opsin, which is primarily much more common in the retina.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4Yx6.png\" alt=\"blue light opsin\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lftqc.png\" alt=\"med wavelength opsin\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This is not a psychosomatic effect.  Light receptors in the skin are <a href=\"http://www.ncpamd.com/seasonal.htm#Theories%20about%20how%20light%20affects%20mood%20and%20sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">known to help with seasonal affective disorder<\/a> - shine a bright or blue light behind your knees.  These receptors are not connected to optical nerves, and so you don't get any image from them, but the information can affect your biochemistry anyway.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The idea of unconscious receptor inputs from other parts of the body probably applies to many sorts of receptors.  This last year there has been a great deal of interest in taste receptors which are expressed in the gut.  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403_supp/full/486S7a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">They can taste sweetness and other flavors a second time and register the gustatory response in the brain<\/a>.  Its not a conscious input, but it registers in the brain in MRI.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Why would evolution do this?  It seems to me that this is a new way of looking at the individual life of a cell and makes a good deal of sense.  If every cell has all the genes' DNA why wouldn't a little bit of receptor expression be found in any cell which could use the information?  The conscious processes of the brain probably only take in a small fraction of the information that is sent in and there maybe hundreds of other such senses from various parts of the body to integrate, only a fraction of which we are aware of.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, there are probably lots of cases where receptor signals are only used locally by cells that are sensing their local environment.  It really doesn't make sense that the individual cells must blind themselves.  Individual bacteria and fungi have scores of receptors.  It makes sense that cells that are part of an organism would have as many or more senses as well.   <\/p>\n","answer_id":6920,"question_id":6919,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1359005515},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b9388a7e480b3eb53b992ce8683729d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1705,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1705/hhh","reputation":198,"display_name":"hhh","accept_rate":25},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1359768000,"creation_date":1359765089,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Do born-blind mammals and later-blinded mammals experience extraretinal\n  photoreception differently?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This article in Scientific American <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-do-blind-people\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> where they refer to \"Circadian and vision neu­ro­scientist Russell G.

Note that individual action potentials are quite transient and, especially in myelinated axons, the resulting currents are local and small. Therefore it's unlikely that a single neuron's activity will have a noticeable effect on nearby neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, in unmyelinated axon tracts and/or when a larger group of neurons is active, ephatic coupling is more likely. In particular, it seems to play a role in synchronizing cell populations during oscillations.

In the deoxygenated state the protein is in the conformation known as the T (for <em>tense<\/em>) state, and this is a low affinity state. The binding of an oxygen molecule to one of the haem groups in one of the globin subunits of the tetramer increases the affinity, so that subsequent binding of oxygen becomes easier. The details of how this happens are still debated, but I think what I have said so far is accepted by everyone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is an equation to represent the binding of the first oxygen molecule to the haemoglobin tetramer:<\/p>\n\n<p>O<sub>2<\/sub> + [Hb]<sub>4<\/sub> &lt;--> [Hb<sub>4<\/sub>]O<sub>2<\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p>If deoxygenated Hb has a low affinity for oxygen then that equilibrium must lie to the left hand side - in other words the right to left reaction (release) is faster than the right to left reaction (binding). This is not consistent with the idea that haemoglobin hangs on to its last oxygen.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The heart, which is the first organ in the blood cycle after the lungs uses a lot of oxygen - if hemoglobin were not cooperative, it might take all the oxygen from hemoglobin just after the beat when it uses oxygen when in distress, creating a block of hemoglobin which is completely without bound oxygen.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is based on an erroneous view of the circulation - it implies that all of the blood passes through the coronary artery before getting to the rest of the body. Oxygenated blood leaves the heart via the aorta. Although it is true that the first branch off the aorta is the coronary artery, most of the blood doesn't enter this branch, but proceeds into the remainder of the circulation. In this sense the coronary circulation (by which I mean coronary artery>coronary veins - the heart's own blood supply) is in parallel with the rest of the circulatory system, not in series with it. At rest, just 5% of the heart's output goes into the coronary circulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to this review, <a href=\"http://physrev.physiology.org/content/88/3/1009.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regulation of Coronary Blood Flow During Exercise<\/a>, (I am simplifying a lot here, but this statement does appear in the review and is not taken out of context): \"Increased myocardial oxygen demands during exercise are met principally by augmenting coronary blood flow.\" At rest the heart is already extracting most of the oxygen from its blood supply (see <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~kj3/Chapter5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for some interesting data) so again there is no question of the heart extracting much more - it simply needs more blood, and of course the increased heart rate will contribute to this. There is also scope for directing a greater proportion of heart output through the coronary circulation, but I have been unable to find any quantitative statements about that. Interestingly, if you take a look at the data in the 1st table of the data <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~kj3/Chapter5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> you will see that, at rest, 22% of the heart's output goes into the renal circulation, but that much less oxygen is extracted from that blood (about one ninth of how much is extracted from the blood going through the cardiac circulation). This represents a source of potential increased blood to be diverted to the heart at the expense of a reduction in renal filtration.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Also - Hemoglobin is pretty clearly an evolutionary adaptation where four myoglobins came together to form a cooperative oxygen binder, so at one time probably myoglobin was the oxygen carrier. There are some primitive animals which have no distinct hemoglobin, just myoglobin like carriers.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree it is clear that haemoglobin and myoglobin evolved from a monomeric myoglobin-like ancestor, and that the appearance of a tetrameric molecule created the potential for co-operative oxygen binding. I am not as convinced by the rest of the sentence. I think we have to agree first on what we mean by an oxygen carrier. What <strong>I<\/strong> mean is a protein that is a component of a circulatory system. I know of no evidence that a myoglobin like molecule could perform this function. This arises directly from the shape of a simple binding curve (a rectangular hyperbola). For the protein to be saturable at atmospheric oxygen concentrations it has to have a certain K<sub>d<\/sub>, and this precludes significant release of oxygen at physiologically useful concentrations. You either have a protein which can unload effectively but will not ever become saturated with oxygen, or you have a molecule that is able to become saturated but cannot ever unload except at every low oxygen concentrations. That is the remarkable thing about haemoglobin - the appearance of cooperative binding allowed for a more switch-like interconversion between a high affinity state, for loading up, and a low-affinity state, for unloading.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if you wish to include intracellular oxygen transport in your definition of \"carrier\" then we enter a whole other debate about the role of myoglobin, but I have gone on for far too long already, so I'll stop there.<\/p>\n","answer_id":6895,"question_id":6891,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1359246162},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":0,"post_id":6928,"edited":false,"creation_date":1359210784,"comment_id":8482,"body":"I have responded to this by editing my answer, since I also needed lots of space."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1359142539,"creation_date":1359140441,"body":"<p>Just wanted to supplement to the other two answers...

There is a scientific genome interpretation 'contest' that has been going on for the past few years called CAGI (<a href=\"https://genomeinterpretation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation<\/a>).  This is meant to be a cutting edge set of challenges and its worth looking them over.  Last year there was in particular one challenge - <a href=\"https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/pgp\" rel=\"nofollow\">answering questions about ten individuals given only a list of traits and their genome sequences<\/a>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>It was not so easy it turns out - simply looking up variants and cross referencing them to the literature led to poor predictions.  Glaucoma, asthma, migrane, irritable bowel syndrome, color blindness, lupus, lactose intolerance are examples from a list of 40-odd contest questions.  If you register onto the site you can get some of the results or there is a paper reporting the results, only four labs tried the challenge and the accuracies were sometimes not great, topping off with Rachel Karchin's lab with an AUC of 90%.  Even some of the phenotypes you think are easy are not a simple lookup.  Genetics is not as pre-determined as we think. <\/p>\n\n<p>While we are good at inferring our history and geneology on the other hand.  A reasonable example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.23andme.com/ancestry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">23andme analysis<\/a>.  They have a lot less information about you than a complete genome sequence, but they do seem to make the most of the 0.0001% of the genome that they do have.<\/p>\n\n<p>They have a nice lookup of some of the hereditary disease data that is available.  \"Increased risk of skin cancer\" or for Alzheimers are only chances and its never clear how much your actual lifestyle has impact on 44 outcomes, but its there.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What they also have is your ancestral analysis which is crazy interesting. it shows where your maternal and paternal lineages come from and how strong.  they have a very pretty heatmap of the continents for this.  National Geographic's DB is probably more sophisticated and ancestry.com also does this.  This is pretty cool.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also included things like curly hair, color of skin eyes and hair.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Like SimaPro says they are described in OMIM.  OMIM stands for 'online mendelian inheritance in man' and all the straightforward directly inheritable traits we know of are listed there.  its worth taking a look. There are not a lot of known single mutation genetically inheritable conditions.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If the genome sequence includes methylation, then some other traits which are epigenetic, not genetic but would also be determined from a genome sequence.  Most famous example of this is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEST_%28gene%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">MEST<\/a> which will give an indicator of whether you are a doting parent or not.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1197,"question_id":1188,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1358964256},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35114dfb827dc71cb3a8ff281617c5b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/535/larry-parnell","reputation":3430,"display_name":"Larry_Parnell"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1330350823,"creation_date":1330350823,"body":"<p>The first place to look for answer to this is the 1000 Genomes Project. I feel that their efforts in data analysis offer lessons on what one can and cannot learn from such a dataset as posed in the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>One obvious thing that is easy to overlook is a whole genome sequence will tell you the mid- to large-sized insertions and deletions in that genome. Any of those that are novel, private or extremely rare (take a word of your choosing) <em>can be used<\/em> to place that individual in a family tree (if other data are available) and to predict certain phenotypes (from the affected genes). This is also true for some SSRs - simple sequence repeats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Good haplotype analysis from the genome sequence can predict ethnic ancestry - with a fair degree of accuracy. This is especially so as more genomes are sequenced and available for comparison. Haplotypes of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial genome, give paternal and maternal ancestry, respectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the whole genome sequence gives accurate telomere lengths, then a prediction of age of the individual can be gained +/- 10 yrs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Disease phenotypes or risk of disease is tricky. For monogenic diseases, this is more accurate and that accuracy falls off as the complexity of contribution to variance of the trait increases. At least a hundred loci contribute to risk of type 2 diabetes, but that risk is also age-dependent and so a young person may not have the disease but only be at increased risk.

If you took a surveyors sight and set a point every 500 ft you would get a certain number, if you paced it out in strides you would end up taking more curves and turns and you would get a longer number.  If you took out a ruler and measured down to the inch you would get a still larger number.

Essentially, the genes encoding the B-cell Receptor, or BCR, have many fragments of several different types in them, and through the process of gene rearrangement the final Complementarity Determining Regions, or CDRs (the antigen-binding sites), are generated into one mature sequence for each individual B-cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>A mature IgG molecule (the soluble, secreted version of the BCR) contains four chains - 2 heavy (each of which are identical to each other) and 2 light (also identical). There are Constant or C regions in each chain that essentially don't vary much, and are not really involved in the process of antigen binding. On the \"business end\" are three regions (or types, from above) called V, D, and J in the heavy chain, while the light chain just has V and J. Those letters are from Variable, Diversity, and Joining, if you're interested.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wP63N.jpg\" alt=\"Janeway Figure 4.3\"> <\/p>\n\n<p>Figure 4.3 from Janeway shows the number of \"fragments\" or gene segments of each type in humans. So, when the heavy chain is being made, 1 fragment out of 65 Vs is picked, 1 of 27 Ds, and one of 6 Js, then each is joined together in a process that can also introduce an additional amount of randomness at the joins. Combine this with an only slightly less complex process in the light chain (as there is no D region), and the fact that a single insertion/deletion of a base pair can drastically effect the resulting protein sequence, and you get a protein with a huge number of possible sequences, potentially in the range of 10<sup>11<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This process of gene rearrangement typically generates immunoglobulins with relatively low affinity for their antigens. During affinity maturation, a process called somatic hypermutation randomly changes individual base pairs (translated to amino acids) in the CDR in cells that are descendents of, and bear the same base sequence as, the original. Cells expressing antigen receptors that are of higher affinity are then positively selected and clonally expanded by the immune system, allowing your body to tailor its response to an infection or other exposure to what it sees as foreign material.<\/p>\n","answer_id":6824,"question_id":6804,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1358432447}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6804/variation-in-antigen-binding-site-of-antibodies","last_activity_date":1358432447,"creation_date":1358211011,"answer_count":2,"title":"variation in antigen binding site of antibodies","body":"<p>Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins made \u200b\u200bby the immune system in response to alien(!) molecules.
