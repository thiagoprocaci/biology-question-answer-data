In this case, I am specifically talking about the viruses that infect bacteria (aka, bacteriophage).<\/p>\n\n<p>1) RM systems may have an anti-viral function. Normally we would think of such systems as being part of the host chromosome, but as Alan Boyd suggested, once a temperate phage has integrated itself into the chromosome, its fitness is tied to its host. Therefore, a RM system found in a prophage could prevent infections by additional phage. See here for a discussion of this issue:\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471617\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471617<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>2) RM systems may have \"addictive\" properties by acting as toxin-antitoxin systems. Basically, this means that if the genes for the RM system are lost, the host cell dies. This can provide selection for the maintenance of plasmids and prophage inside of the host cell. See here for a discussion of this issue:\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3874152/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3874152/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>3) Finally, viruses need to destroy the host genome -- both to suppress any anti-viral response and to release nutrients for viral replication. While this is typically achieved with nucleases other than restriction endonucleases, there is at least one situation where a RE seems to be involved.

The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (<em>Stegosaurus<\/em>, <em>Triceratops<\/em>, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like <em>Tyrannosaurus<\/em> and <em>Allosaurus<\/em>. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_06\">birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs <em>and<\/em> reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.<\/p>\n\n<h3>A few words about pterosaurs<\/h3>\n\n<p>Along with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs <em>are<\/em> flying reptiles but <em>not<\/em> flying dinosaurs.<\/p>\n\n<p>These images might help you understand the above explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nPg3f.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MpU6G.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":17549,"question_id":17546,"up_vote_count":36,"last_edit_date":1400805980},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWBJh.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6800,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6800/sqb","reputation":206,"display_name":"SQB"},"score":17,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1400813469,"creation_date":1400742185,"body":"<p>In addition to <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/17549\">kmm's excellent answer<\/a>, I'd like to present <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/1211/\">the xkcd point of view<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/birds_and_dinosaurs.png\" alt=\"xkcd/1211\" title=\"Sure, T. rex is closer in height to Stegosaurus than a sparrow.

That is, their need for biological processes is not tied specifically to photosynthesis: anything that lives is going to need them, pretty much for anything it might want to do.  It would make sense for them to be a limiting nutrient for almost anything that's trying to grow, plant or animal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yet for animals the limiting \"nutrient\" seems to always be energy, ie: food.

A publication can't just be a bunch of random small and unrelated questions and experiments, at least not in any peer-reviewed journal. The key to a successful paper is that it should have ideally one message, which can be identified in the title, since believe it or not thats how most scientists vet whether a paper (abstract/summary) worth looking at or not. So as correctly mentioned, you identify a gap in the knowledge and attempt to address it having considered what is know about it so far, if any. Writing a paper follows a global formula, which has been elaborated in Chris response. Hence the key is that the paper has to tell ideally one story and the experiments used to address it has to make a logical progression to address the question. So you can't just jump from a small preliminary experiment which is questionable in its reliability into a large scale experiment. Some times you have to make the leap of \"faith\" in your experimentations and just do a certain experiment but the chances are your previous experiments have given you an indication as to whether its going to work or not. Be very mindful that most of the time the order in which you do your experiments is not the order in which you put them in the paper so what usually happens is that you have a central question, you do a bunch of experiments to address it and then you shuffle them around to tell the story in the most concise way and again the key word here is story.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now not only a paper has to tell a concise story but it has to be of general interest to the scientific community, specially in high impact journals. You probably know a recent paper about STAP cell lines that got into Nature and attracted world-wide attention in which the authors described how exposing the cells to stimulus/stressors such as acid or pressure can turn it pluripotent, which the media linked to personalised treatments. Now I don't want to get into all the controversy that followed it but its just to make the point that a research like this is not only of interest to the scientific community but also the public hence it got published in a highly respectable journal. Now whether thats the right thing for scientists to do and send important research to the top journals, which is hard to access by many countries is a whole different argument but I hope you can begin to see publishing a paper in a journal is not only related to its scientific merits but also to what extent it is of interest to the general or scientific community and what story is it telling or implying (to put it a bit more crudely). Now not every paper makes it to Nature and most of the time publications are highly specialised work which not everyone on the planet might be interested in them but they still follow the points I talked about.<\/p>\n\n<p>hope this helps!<\/p>\n","answer_id":17575,"question_id":17571,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1400783032}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17571/how-does-a-biologist-decide-when-she-has-enough-results-to-publish-a-paper","last_activity_date":1400805683,"creation_date":1400774967,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does a biologist decide when she has enough results to publish a paper?","body":"<p>Biology is so exciting!

It also depends on the environment since insoluble salts which are subjected to strong acids can release fluorine ions.\nThe certain toxic dose for adults is 32-64mg/kg body weight, a 75kg adult needs to take up between 2,4 and 4,8 grams of fluoride ions (for sodium fluoride this would be between 5,3 and 10,6 gr of the salt). For children this is about 5mg/kg body weight.\nFor the water the added dose of fluorine is much lower, somewhere between 0,7 and 1.2 mg/l. Other sources of fluroride are food (especially sea food) and also black tea.<\/p>\n\n<p>The toxicity of fluoride is mediated by different ways: First it forms an insoluble salt with calcium in the cells, effectively causing hypocalcemia. Calcium is an important second messenger in different signal transduction pathways as well as highly important for the functioning of nerve cells (which also explains why it is neurotoxic in the development of nerve and brain cells). It also causes the inhibition of a number of different enzymes as enolase (disturbs the glycolysis) but also phosphatases and katalase. For all of this have a look into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride\">Wikipedia<\/a> if you want to know more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>About the paper: It is a review of published research articles which sums up the situation in this field. The paper mentions fluoride only twice: Once on the abstract and once in a table about newly identified developmental neurotoxins (table 2 to be precise). It references only one meta-analysis on this topic.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cited meta-analysis (\"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820538\">Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: a systematic review and meta-analysis<\/a>\") which did a statistical meta-analysis of published papers and their data. They find a significant relation between the fluoride content of the drinking water and the IQ of the children.\nHowever this is not undisputed (to say it mildly), since while a finding can be statistically significant, it doesn't necessarily mean that there is clinical importance. The other important point which @Doctor Whom mentioned is that a correlation doesn't imply a causation. So even if there seems to be a correlation between two things, they are not necessarily connected (see the famous example of storchs and birth rates). <\/p>\n\n<p>This paper (\"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23455234\">Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: clinical importance versus statistical significance.<\/a>\") is published as a comment on the original paper and claims exactly this. They say the the mean difference in IQ is about 7 points, which is not of clinical importance. Another paper critizes the relatively low quality of the original papers used for the study (\"<a href=\"http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/126-1375/5664/\">Fluoride and children's IQ.<\/a>\"). <\/p>\n\n<p>They also mention a low consensus about what is a high concentration of fluoride in the drinking water and also show the very wide variation of the fluoride concentration in the original studies. The highest concentrations mentioned are around 10mg/l which is about 10x the concentration used for adding fluoride to the water. Even if we take in account that children are more sensitive to fluoride and also need lower fluoride concentrations to cuse some developmental damages (below the fatal concentration) this would still add up to quite absurd amounts of water they have to drink.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding your questions: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A developmental neurotoxin is a substance which interferes with developing neurons or nerve cells. It either inhibits their growth completely or at least impairs the cells.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Given on the articles I found (and cited above) I would say that fluoride is a developmental neurotoxin. Nevertheless it seems to me that it is not very strong in this context as the current studies are contradictory.

Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. <strong>Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants<\/strong>\u2014manganese, <strong>fluoride<\/strong>, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity. To coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention, we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't have full access to the article, so I can't refer to the epidemiological study it says shows fluoride to be a developmental neurotoxicant.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is a developmental neurotoxicant?<\/li>\n<li>How strong is the research that claims fluoride is a developmental neurotoxicant?<\/li>\n<li>What relationship, if any, does this report or research have with typical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation\">fluoride compounds used in US water treatment<\/a> at the levels typically present in US water (sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluorosilicate at 0.7 mg/L)? <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","question_id":17550,"tags":["biochemistry","development","toxicology"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":227,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1400693284},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/604ea64b5a568206203ca834987530be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6442,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6442/speedoheck","reputation":90,"display_name":"speedoheck","accept_rate":50},"closed_date":1400773713,"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/604ea64b5a568206203ca834987530be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6442,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6442/speedoheck","reputation":90,"display_name":"speedoheck","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":17562,"edited":false,"creation_date":1400732904,"comment_id":24022,"body":"Good one potterbond007"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":17562,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/604ea64b5a568206203ca834987530be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6442,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6442/speedoheck","reputation":90,"display_name":"speedoheck","accept_rate":50},"edited":false,"creation_date":1400733021,"comment_id":24023,"body":"@speedoheck Thx.

Now your question has three parts as far as I understand it.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do phospho-protein binding domains only bind to phosphorylated proteins i.e. is that their sole (observed) function.<\/li>\n<li>What roles do phospho-protein binding domains mediate.<\/li>\n<li>Function of BRCA1 phosphorylation/phospho-protein binding<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Just to get some basics out of the way, there are three amino-acid residues in a protein that can become post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, including serine, threonine and tyrosine. Now the purpose of protein phosphorylation ranges from activation/deactivation signals to binding and changing cellular localisation i.e. recruiting a protein to different part of a cell. Now tyrosine phosphorylation, which I know by far the most about is capable of all the above. So if you think about a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), once a ligand such as EGF binds to it, it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated (activated) through its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Once tyrosine phosphorylated, many proteins are capable of binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated RTKs such as Grb2 to induce a signal downstream of RTKs. So as you can see, phosphorylation of RTK affected cellular localisation of GRB2. Excellent Ras signalling review by Karnoub &amp; Weinberg, 2008 Nature reviews (Fig 5). Grb2 binds to phospho-RTKs through a specific domain called Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, which provides a platform for other proteins such as Son of sevenless (SOS) which is a GEF to bind to it and induce RTK signalling through Ras. So in the above case the role of phospho-protein binding domain (SH2) is to change cellular localisation of multiple proteins and mediate signalling.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now I'm no expert in BRCA1 but just had a quick look and it seems serine phosphorylation of BRCA1 may be responsible for its recruitment to the DNA site of damage and if serine residues in BRCA1 are mutated, the protein will no longer get phosphorylated, which may effect its recruitment to the DNA sites of damage, which may affect its DNA damage response function (Clark et al 2012 Comput Struct Biotechnol J). Now BRCA has a phospho-protein binding domain called BRCT, and that is also thought to mediate DNA binding and binds to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins. So BRCA1 phosphorylation and phospho-protein binding is though to be important in its function (Clark et al 2012 Comput Struct Biotechnol J). So to answer your question in short, phospho-protein binding domains such as BRCT do not necessarily bind to their target proteins through phosphorylation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17559,"question_id":14096,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14096/what-is-a-phospho-protein-binding-domain","last_activity_date":1400713306,"creation_date":1387637528,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is a phospho-protein binding domain?","body":"<p>Is this just a domain that binds proteins that have been phosphorylated?

How practical is it for you to count the total number of bees in the hive, based on lets say hive weight or the number of bees on one rack in the hive (then multiply by the total number of racks to give you an estimate of the total bee numbers in a hive) before you start collecting video data? This will at least put your influx/outflow number into some sort of prospective if you are counting in different times of days or if there are different wheather conditions in different days. This is easily achieved if you divide your influx and outflow numbers by the total (estimated) number of bees. This gets you two numbers (ratios) which you plot on the Y-axis. On the x-axis you can plot the passage of time and even colour code different days based on average (lets say) temperature to see if temperature had an obvious effects on your observations. But obviously all your instances of recording and time intervals between recordings needs to be constant!<\/p>\n\n<p>So in many fly behavioural or locomotion function assays, scientists record fly movements at certain fps and analyse the videos. Now most of this video data analysis  is done using scripting in Matlab which is (I know to be) the tool choice for motion analysis. Now since you say you are at high school, this would probably be quite a challenge since the program is costly and scripting is not that easy (at least for me), so see if you can utilise the help of someone to get over this barrier. Once you do then you can analyse much longer videos at much higher frequencies, which will give you a better resolution on your data. If you could't then consider looking through web sites using search engines such as google for Matlab codes for motion tracking analysis scripts. I did this some time ago and there are wealth of information out there and once you do that you can get the communities help in websites such as stack overflow to help you refine your codes or any problems you may have with it, so long as you show evidence of your work. This is a great option since you can add variety of data (or different data aspects) to your project such as what is the average speed/velocity which your bees travel at in different times when entering/exiting the hive, is there a pattern to their travelling (e.g. straight line, zig-zag etc) and much more.

My task is to analyze the influence of certain environmental factors (temperature etc., it's not that important for my question) on the activity of bees. The method is pretty simple: once a week I record the entrance to the bee hive (I do it on four hives), play it in slow-mo (It's impossible to count them properly without doing so) and simply count the number of bees entering or leaving.<\/p>\n\n<p>Problem is, I don't know how long the observation should take. I play it in like X1/8, you need to play it twice (entering/leaving), so it takes a lot of time to gather one piece of information for a certain day.

I can't do the observation for hours - I still need to learn and have other duties.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what should I do? Could anyone give me some advice?

We know what makes one cell type different from another cell type is its expression - i.e. what genes are actually being transcribed into RNA. Therefore, there should be certain RNA in one cell type that should not exit in another cell type. If you isolate RNA from a certain cell type, say a neuron and you want to show that your sample RNA contains only neuronal RNA, than you have to prove 2 things:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That your sample contains certain RNA sequences that are known to be in neurons<\/li>\n<li>That your sample does NOT contain certain RNA sequences that are known NOT to be in neurons<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>There are several lab procedures for identifying the presence/absence of certain RNA sequences in a sample, your chosen technique is qPCR. Here is a brief explanation of how qPCR works. <\/p>\n\n<p>You put your RNA sample along with a sequence specific primer in the qPCR machine. The primer will bind to a specific sequence and then that strand will be replicated. This will keep on repeating, cycle after cycle. So if you start with 1 sequence of say sequenceA, after cycle 1, you will end up with 2, then 4, then 8 and so on. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, if your goal is to use qPCR to prove your RNA sample comes from a neuron then you must find some sequences that are known to be specific to neurons. Then find primers for these sequences. Then use these primers to amplify some RNA from your sample. If you get amplification, then you must have had that sequence in your RNA sample. To further support yourself, you may also want to look up a few sequences that are known NOT to be expressed in neurons and using the same principle prove that these sequences are NOT in your sample.<\/p>\n\n<p>The above will give you qualitative data, it will simply tell you if a certain sequence exits or does not exist in your RNA sample. Since you are only interested in the presence or absence of markers, this should be sufficient. Howver, if you would like to quantify your data, i.e. find out how much a certain sequence is expressed then read on. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can also get quantitative data from qPCR (after all qPCR stands for quantitative PCR). The number of copies of an RNA sequence after a certain number of cycles is proportional to the initial number of copies of that sequence in your sample. In other words, if your initial RNA sample has a lot of sequenceA and a little sequenceB, then at any cycle, you should see more sequenceA. <\/p>\n\n<p>We can take advantage of this relationship. There are two general methods you can use to quantify your results. One is called Absolute quantification and the other Relative quantification. <\/p>\n\n<p>The idea behind absolute quantification is that you run two qPCRs. In one, you do your RNA sample. In the second, you run a standard sample, for which a standard curve is available. You can then compare your RNA sample results with the standard's results to get an idea of the number of copies in your sample.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea behind relative quantification is that you compare the qPCR results for your sequence of interest with the qPCR results of a refrence gene. This will only give you an idea of how many times more or less your sequence of interest if expressed than the reference gene. Since you do not have a refrence gene you cannot use this method, but you can use the absolute quantification method explained in the paragraph above!<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are very useful links on quantifying using qPCR:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction#Quantification_of_gene_expression\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction#Quantification_of_gene_expression<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://relative.gene-quantification.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://relative.gene-quantification.info/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you need further clarifications.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17521,"question_id":17519,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17519/a-question-related-to-qpcr-analysis","last_activity_date":1400542113,"creation_date":1400532217,"answer_count":1,"title":"A question related to qPCR analysis","body":"<p>Here is the thing.

Under normal circumstances UPRT creates UMP from host cells' uracil and this UMP incorporated in RNA. However, they found that this enzyme cannot distinguish uracil and uracil analog 4-Thiouracil (Basically has thio on 4th position of the uracil). So, when 4-TU provided externally, UPRT incorporates 4-TU into RNA and you get thio-RNA. Then with basic biotinylation and streptaividin isolation you can get thio-RNA from your total RNA isolate. (Of course UPRT should be put to specific cell types of your interest)<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, after the explanation (maybe it was unnecessary though) here is my question.<\/p>\n\n<p>After I isolate my so called specific RNA, I check the purity by qPCR by using cell type specific markers. I do not have a reference gene. The only thing I am interested in is the presence or absence of markers (and also the fold change of course).

Birds and reptiles tend to have lots of chromosomal breakage, even to the point  where the number of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchromosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">microchromosomes<\/a> (less than 20 million bases).  Mammals tend to be more conservative and not allow viable chromosomal breaks - chickens have 78 chromosomes to our 23..<\/p>\n\n<p>3) idiomatic chromosomal behavior.  Sex determining chromosomes are examples of chromosomes where a pair becomes distinctly different in size and composition.<br>\nAnother example is in trypanosome which has many tiny DNA segments which code for variant surface coat proteins. <\/p>\n\n<p>4) @rwst points, what I clean forgot, that occasionally (like maybe just a few times) there have been <a href=\"http://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/Whole_genome_duplication#Detecting_paleopolyploidy\" rel=\"nofollow\">whole genome duplications<\/a>.  This can be identified by chromosomal alignments within a single genome and has not happened very often since we became eukaryotic metazoans.  Not sure how many times, but perhaps just once or twice in our lineage.  If anyone knows about animals/humans that would be great. As you can see the link shows whole genome duplications in plants, which don't seem care how many chromosomes there are.  Plants have polyploidy, you see, so such duplication events are much better tolerated.  On the other hand plants can't play video games. <\/p>\n\n<p>P. Dehal, J. L.

I hope this makes a better answer for the community.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Under <em>normal<\/em> circumstances, genomic (self) or mtDNA released into your cell or body cause absolutely no (known) problems.   I'll explain why that is, how the body can detect bacterial DNA, and finally the circumstances in which DNA can cause problems.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Self-DNA generally causes no problems<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Almost from conception, cells in your body die.  Sometimes as part of pre-programmed sequence (eg inter-digital cells of the fetal limb paddle die and form fingers) or normal replenishment of cells such as the white blood cell (hundreds of millions of neutrophils die each day) or your gut epithelium.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Macrophages consume liberated DNA, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticuloendothelial\" rel=\"nofollow\">reticulo-endothelial system in the spleen, liver and lungs<\/a> filters the blood for cellular fragments.  <a href=\"http://www.jimmunol.org/content/157/5/2116.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper (from @Superbest)<\/a> shows that bacterial DNA, and not normal human genomic DNA, can activate macrophages.<\/p>\n\n<p>So your immune system develops, and is constantly being exposed to, virtually every cell type and cell component (proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA etc).  If self-DNA could spark an immune reaction, normal life would be difficult.  We don't make antibodies (from B-cells) or T-cells that react with self-components due to a process called <em>anergy<\/em> in which any developing T- or B- cells that could react to self-components during their maturation are instructed to shut down and/or die.   Yes, mitochondrial are inherited matrilinearly, but they still lyse and cause anergy, preventing an auto-immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Not all cell death is harmless- @Superbest's comment reminds us that apoptosis (involved in finger formation and other tissue remodelling and cell turnover) can package cellular components into self-contained vesicles.  On the other hand, damaged or lysed cells can liberate cytoplasmic components that can be pro-inflammatory or pro-coagulant.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Macrophages' vacuoles contain DNAse II, an enzyme that degrades DNA it encounters following phagocytosing/endocytosing fragments of dead cells.  More about that later....<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Our bodies can detect bacterial DNA.  Same DNA, different decoration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>However, invaders (bacterial, viruses, worms etc) may activate a family of receptors called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Toll-like receptors<\/em> (TLRs)<\/a>.   TLRs have evolved to have specificity for antigens not seen in mammals e.g <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor#Summary_of_known_mammalian_TLRs\" rel=\"nofollow\">cell walls, bacterial flagella and so on<\/a>.  Some TLRs <em>do<\/em> recognise DNA or RNA.  You may know that DNA contains 4 nucleotide bases, A,T,G and C.  In mammals, special sequences of two bases, C-G, (called \"CpG\"s) can be enzymatically modified by a methyl group.  In bacterial CpGs are not typically methylated and so a TLR (e.g TLR-9) that detects un-methylated CpGs is generally detecting bacterial DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mitochondria are different<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Mitochondria have features that resemble bacteria: a cell wall, a genome and the production of proteins that begin with the amino acid N-formyl-Methionine (f-Met).  Mammalian proteins don't have f-Met at the start (\"N-terminus\").  Macrophages have a receptor that can recognize f-Met sequences (especially f-Met-Leu-Phe, fMLP) and activation of the fMLP receptor stimulates phagocytosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804556\" rel=\"nofollow\">2013 paper<\/a> describes the controversy whether mammalian  mtDNA is methylated (at CpGs) and offers strong evidence that it <strong>is<\/strong> methylated.    In contrast, the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature10992.html#supplementary-information\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oka paper<\/a>  gives 5 citations where mtDNA <strong>is not<\/strong> CpG-methylated.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So..do mitochondria look like bacteria to our innate immune system?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>@user22406 flagged <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature10992.html#supplementary-information\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper by Oka <em>et al<\/em><\/a> which cites <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20203610\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper by Zhang <em>et al<\/em><\/a> as evidence that mtDNA can be pro-inflammatory.  The <em>Zhang paper<\/em> provides evidence that mitochondria can stimulate the immune system's receptors for (1) f-Met-peptides (i.e detecting mitochondrial proteins that look 'bacterial\") and (2) receptors for un-methylated CpGs, the TLR-9 receptor.  The Commentary on the article has a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857339/figure/F1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>great figure of how mito components might promote inflammation<\/strong><\/a> which copyright prevents me adding. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <em>Oka paper<\/em> uses 2 key techniques: (1) surgical constriction of the aorta to cause heart enlargement (cardiac hypertrophy) and (2) a mouse strain with the gene for DNAse II deleted (noted as -/-, two minuses, both alleles gone).  In the hearts of DNAse II -/- mice, they observe higher levels of deposition of mtDNA in the damaged heart (Supplemental Fig 2), greater heart damage and many animals die.  This <em>suggests<\/em> that excessive levels of DNA (not degraded in these DNAse -/-  mice) may be driving the damage. (The general phenotype of DNAse -/- mice was studied by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17066036\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kawane <em>et al<\/em><\/a>  and the mice get an arthritis).  In Oka's DNAse II -/- mice, the degree of heart damage can be reduced by blocking TLR-9 (using an inhibitory oligo).  In aortic constricted mice where the DNAse II gene is intact (+/+), adding the TLR-9 blocking oligo gave some improvement, suggesting that the level of unmethylated DNA liberated in tissue damage <strong>may stimulate TLR-9 in normal animals.<\/strong> \nThe authors also examined aortic constriction in TLR-9 -/- mice and found they had less lung and heart damage compared to controls.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, the <em>Oka<\/em> paper suggests something is signalling  via TLR-9 to drive inflammation and damage in this model and implies (but does not prove) that the 'something' is mtDNA.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>mtDNA in the plasma<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843437/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zhang paper<\/a>  detects up to 1ug/ml of mtDNA in the blood following major trauma (car and motorcycle crashes, falling 4 stories etc).  Their paper shows that this level of liberated mitochondria could stimulate immune cells (via TLR-9 and f-Met receptor).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>mtDNA won't get back inside the cell<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Extracellular DNA and RNA is generally broken down and cleared rapidly.  DNA, being a large, negatively charged molecule, will have extreme difficulty passing through an intact cell membrane.  In the laboratory, cells need to be exposed to high voltage electric shocks to make transient 'pores' in the cell membrane to allow DNA to enter or have the DNA formulated in liposomes.  Even if endocytosed, there is no known pathway to direct endocytosed DNA to the nucleus or an new mitochondrial 'host'.  So mtDNA would be extremely unlikely to re-seed into a new cell or a mitochondria.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But self-DNA can be harmful if released in large quantities<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>During successful cancer chemotherapy, large numbers of tumor cells lyse and may give rise to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_lysis_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumor lysis syndrome<\/a>.

This is simply the case because protein is what is important functionally (purely talking about protein based problems/questions here and not talking about RNAi stuff here) so what I have experienced editors require for majority of papers, they want to see some sort of protein work. Now I'm aware that is not always possible since the antibody (Ab) might not be very specific or sensitive specially for low expressing proteins. If a protein is highly transient that makes the problem even worse, which is why many people resort to mRNA expression to make deductive reasoning for the presence of proteins although that makes a number of assumptions about how the mRNA is processed and whether the relationship between mRNA expression and protein expression level is linear but thats another discussion. So all I'm trying to say is that it's important check for the presence of a protein using Ab based techniques, which are immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western-blot (WB).<\/p>\n\n<p>So my primary recommendation is to use Gi and Gs species specific (non-cross reactive) antibodies to check for the presence of your proteins of interest and always use Ab heavy chain control for IHC and a negative control for your WB using a sample that you know doesn't express your proteins of interest, if thats available. IHC also tells you some spatial information and whether Gs and Gi are both present in the same cell line or not and if they co-localise etc etc! Obviously check for Ab availability and if its compatible for IHC or WB procedures.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other method that is feasible is if you know your two different cells express only one of the Gs or Gi exclusively, you can look at their specific inhibitors and add it to some of your cells and the chances are if the dose is high enough it will cause the cells to die since Gs or Gi are crucial for cell function. You can probably get away with an experiment like this using wells in a 24 well dish so you don't have to use that much media or drugs. But with stuff like this it might not work and you might get off-target effects so just do this as a complementary test. For your drug test always do a DMSO control since the chances are that's what the drugs are dissolved in and if not just use whatever solvent the drugs are dissolved in and add them to your cells in your control experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the other possible and commonly used method to check for the gene expression of protein and subsequently infer its presence as a protein is to use a reverse transcription based PCR, such as RT-PCR although it doesn't have to be real-time as correctly mentioned in the comments. Please note that I'm not at all an expert in this and do check my answer in this section since I haven't personally done reverse transcription based PCR. As far as I'm aware, the basic procedure is to extract cellular mRNA, which can be performed using kits such as RNeasy or a similar product (I'm not promoting any products here and these are just what I have came across!). The protocols come with the kits and available online, and tells you exactly what min/max cell number/RNA levels should be present and how your cells should be (pelleted) before processing. Another method for RNA extraction is CsCl but thats pretty messy and complicated and requires high expertise to get it right but I know its inevitable for certain situations but for cell processing, a kit will do. At least RNeasy protocol states it enriches for mRNA and selectively exclude other types of RNA. Once you have your cellular mRNA you can proceed to reverse transcription using the appropriately designed primers for your gene of interest using a thermocycler. Again I'm not sure what tools to use for designing the primers for making cDNA from mRNA and what to look for (apart from the fact that make sure your primers are specific) as I only do regular PCR but would welcome any edits! Once you get from mRNA to cDNA, you can then run them on your (Ethidium Bromide or whatever DNA staining based) agarose gel and see if your amplicon is present and is the correct size (again based on the primers you have chosen you would know what the correct size is) and hence whether your gene is expressed or not. At least RNeasy kit says you do not need to use DNase digestion to get rid of any DNA before reverse transcribing your mRNA as most of it gets cleaned up when using the kit but you have that option. Now regarding the next-generation RNA sequencing I do not know anything about them so would again welcome any edits but seems unnecessary since you only want to know if the gene of interest is expressed so don't need any sequence info but thats an option too (although I imagine a little expensive?). Just to mention something very obvious, it's important that the species, which your lines have been generated from are sequenced or you have good sequence information about the Gs and Gi genes in your lines otherwise designing primers would be guess work. Its always best to see if anyone has done what you are trying to do and ask for their primers as most people are happy to share reagents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you have probably noticed so far that my methods are quite biased towards molecular biology approaches and that's simply because that's what I know more about, however a great suggestion was to use cAMP levels as an indicator for Gs or Gi expression. Again I'm not an expert in this since I haven't ever analysed small molecules but I imagine that involves something like a HPLC, which you need to discuss with a chemist/biochemist how to extract and clean up your cells from everything and leave only the cAMP. There is probably a procedure/kit/biosensor for it but I will avoid getting into it as I know virtually nothing about this. However I have a note of caution for these types of indirect experiments. I have no idea what your cell lines are and how well they are characterised but since lines have all sorts of mutations and deletions and insertions in them, it's not a good idea to make inferences from cAMP levels. Since considering cAMP presence is quite important for cellular function, their absolute levels in a cell line is not necessarily a good indicator of whether one cAMP production regulator is present or not and I'm sure if you do something like this you open yourself to major criticism by any journal editor/referee. What will be a good idea though in any future experiments you do with these cells is to over express Gs or Gi and see their effects on cAMP production but I just don't recommend using cAMP levels as a sole indicator as to whether Gs or Gi is expressed or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>If everything else fails and you got tired and wanted to wash your hands off this identification task, you can always lyse your cells and send them for mass spectrometry (MS) if there is such a facility at your institute. It's crucial that the species, which your lines originate from are characterised in terms of their global protein sequences since programs such as Mascot query the raw spectral data against databases such as UniProt to get protein coverage and subsequently protein hits. Also before you go ahead with you MS experiments, just speak to the facility manager and ask for guidance as to what lysis buffer is best to lyse your cells in and what components should not be in your lysis buffer and how sensitive their machines are and how likely you are to get detection and what your protein concentration should be. I think the best machine to use is Orbitrap and as a general rule, the higher the protein amount, the more likely you are to detect it. Since cell lysate is pretty messy and the MS machine columns can get saturated by abundant proteins such as actin, it would be best to run your lysates on an SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions (you can even do multiple loads by running your samples in the gel, switching off the WB machine, loading more samples and running them in the gel and continue doing this a few times. It works, I have done it myself but for pulled down samples which are a bit cleaner (less contaminants/unwanted proteins) in general). Once your gel runs through just cut the region of the gel corresponding to the molecular weights of Gs and Gi and send that for MS identification. This method (running your lysate through SDS-PAGE gel) gets rid of unwanted proteins that can interfere with the identification process. But MS is very expensive!<\/p>\n\n<p>Again I would highly welcome any edits to my own edited reply!

By the way, knockout rats who lack of histamine system don't show big defects in any function.<\/p>\n\n<p>H1-Receptors for Histamine are distributed in the CNS and in the rest of the body. H1-antagonists (such as Promethazine, Chlorcyclizine, Loratadine...) have different effects on CNS, depending on dose. At conventional doses central depression appears and patients are sedated. They can even experience an antihistamine \"hangover\" in the morning, even if they take these drugs at bedtime. By the way, antihistamine overdose typically shows with convulsions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The \"non-sedating\" H1-antagonists, or \"second generation\" have a lot less effects on CNS. They have polar chemical structure: they can not cross the blood-brain barrier.\nBy the way, a lot of typical and atypical anti-psychotic drugs have H1-antagonism effects on the brain (with H2 and H4 antagonism): their main goal is sedation to stop the patient from hurting himself (or others) during manic episodes.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I think the last two sentences explain that sedation is almost a totally CNS-mediated side effect of antihistamine drugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>H1-antagonists don't suppress gastic secretion, do not inhibit salivary, lacrimal or other exocrine secretions. Older H1-antagonists have an anti-colinergic effect on muscarinic receptors: they may reduce ACh-mediated secretions, typically in mouth and in the respiratory tree.<\/p>\n\n<p>H2-antagonists are used to treat acid-peptic desease (as PPIs, proton pump inhibitors). CNS-related side effects are not commons, and include: confusion, delirium, hallucinations, slurred speech and headaches. These effects are mostly related with IV infusion of the H2-antagonist.<\/p>\n\n<p>I just made a very small research on PubMed. I found this:\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3529778\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3529778<\/a>\nas you can see it is a study (on only 9 patients, in 1986), about insuline-glucose-Cpeptide and ranitidine (H2-antagonist) relations. Their conclusion is \"Ranitidine significantly increased the area under concentration/time curves for glucose and insulin but not that of C-peptide. Our data indicate that ranitidine does not affect pancreatic insulin release nor peripheral glucose utilization and are consistent with the hypothesis that ranitidine influences the hepatic clearance of glucose and insulin both of which undergo high first-pass liver extraction.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that tiredness is a typical CNS-mediated side effects of H1-antagonists (anti-allergic) but is not a side effect of H2-antagonists (anti-acid).

It could also occur by chance in unrelated individuals (well, everyone is somewhat related...) but this is extremely rare. There is just that too much variation in the human genome. There are literally tens of millions of points in the genome where some people have one version and others have another, and this person would have to happen to have the exact same version at each one as you do.

The genotype doesn't depend on the <em>number<\/em> of genes, but rather, almost all genes exist in several <em>variants<\/em> within the human population.

So in other words, each gene can have different alleles.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>People with identical appearance<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>If two people have identical alleles for all genes (i.e. identical genotype), then they can indeed look almost identical. However, because of the vast number of genes and alleles present in the human population, it is practically impossible for the same alleles to come together in two humans. With only one exception: if two individuals result from the same combination of sperm and egg cell, they will be identical, and this is exactly what happens in monozygotic twins.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Similarities by geographical region<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>However, the total number of genes and alleles is limited (**). This concept is what people call the \"gene pool\" and is the reason why humans are still always humans and share certain similarities. In particular, for most of human history our geographical movement has been limited (most of the time), creating geographical \"sub-gene pools\" (to keep it simple). This is why people from the same geographical region are more likely to look similar; they have a higher chance to share the same alleles of genes that determine appearance. In terms of behaviour - to whatever degree genotype influences behaviour, peopel from the same geographical region will be more likely to be similar in these regards than people from different geographical regions. However, you can now hopefully understand why this \"degree of similarity\" is next to impossible to quantify (lack of knowledge: which genes determine what, how many alleles exist of them, how many people have which allele, how much and how far do people travel,...).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(*) Ok, not quite - it is possible for an individual to have the odd gene actually completely missing, but for the sake of simplicity we all have the same number.<\/p>\n\n<p>(**) Again, not strictly, because new alleles and possibly even entire genes can result from mutation, but this is relatively rare and on the large scale you can work on the assumption that they are limited in number.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17478,"question_id":17441,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17441/what-makes-us-all-different-and-similar-to-some-extent","last_activity_date":1400328405,"creation_date":1400154330,"answer_count":2,"title":"What makes us all different and similar to some extent?","body":"<p>It is said that genes define how we look physically and psychologically; so for example if a male human sperm carries a certain number of genes, say x, and a female carries y, then mathematically there would be m genes from the male and n from the female, and a finite total available.

At the time, however, proteins seemed to be a better\n  choice for the genetic material, because chemical analyses had shown\n  that proteins are more varied than DNA in their chemical composition,\n  as well as in their physical properties.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>While perhaps easy to dismiss in hindsight, it is possible to understand the reasoning of the day. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"central dogma\"<\/a> of molecular biology, that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins was only described later, and explained how the production of complex proteins consisting of 20-odd amino acids can be directed by a polymer consisting of only four nucleotides. This allows great complexity and variety in phenotypes while maintaining simplicity of the genetic material. The central dogma also facilitates the seperation of the <em>use<\/em> (through protein expression) and <em>storage<\/em> (as DNA) of genetic material.<\/p>\n\n<p>As Watson and Crick noted in their <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">famous paper<\/a>, the double helix of DNA, when discovered, immediately suggested how the genetic material could be elegantly copied. While the more complex structure of proteins would likely require a more complex copying mechanism, the specification of amino acids through three-nucleotide codons in DNA allows the regularity of the DNA material to be retained for easy replication while allowing complex proteins to be produced.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, even though DNA is the primary genetic material today, the situation may have been different at the time life first appeared. According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">RNA world hypothesis<\/a>, RNA may have been the original genetic material and that DNA is a variation of RNA, not the other way around as it is commonly seen.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a fuller historical perspective, I recommend the book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1107604664\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"What is Life?\"<\/a> by Erwin Schrödinger, which was written before the discovery of DNA as the genetic material.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16601,"question_id":10184,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10184/why-only-dna-can-contain-hereditary-material","last_activity_date":1400259482,"creation_date":1378031666,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why Only DNA can Contain Hereditary Material?","body":"<p>Well I'm well aware that it is proven that DNA contains  genetic material via transformation and Hershey-Chase Experiment of T2 bacteriophage.

Here's an annotated version of your diagram with my own thoughts (it's been a while since I've done this but should hopefully be accurate):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wvSU5.jpg\" alt=\"Annotated pedigree chart\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation 2:<\/strong>  As you realised, the trait is autosomal recessive so the female (II:2) has the genotype <em>aa<\/em>.  The male is considered wild type unless informed otherwise, giving him a genotype of <em>AA<\/em>.  I think you had worked all this out, but they are shown in red on the diagram.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation 3:<\/strong> Using the two genotypes of the parents from II (red), we know that all the progeny in generation III are carriers - i.e. <em>Aa<\/em> genotypes.  This is indicated for III:6 in orangey-brown.  I think you also worked this out successfully.  However in your original chart, III:7 is noted as <em>Aa<\/em>.  III:7 is from outside of the affected family and would therefore again be considered to have be wild type and therefore instead have the genotype <em>AA<\/em> - shown in purple.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation 4:<\/strong> In order to work out the potential genotypes of IV:1 we have to do a cross between the two parents III:6 and III:7 - which works out as follows:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>        |          Male          |\n        |     A            a     |\n        |------------------------|\nF       |                        |\ne     A |    AA            Aa    |\nm       |                        |\na       |                        |\nl     A |    AA            Aa    |\ne       |                        |\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, there is a 50% chance of IV:1 being healthy <em>AA<\/em> and a 50% chance of being a carrier <em>Aa<\/em> - shown in green.  As IV:2 is affected, we know his genotype is <em>aa<\/em> (pink).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation V:<\/strong>  Now for answer to your first question.  If IV:1 had the <em>AA<\/em> genotype then the child could <strong>never<\/strong> be affected, reducing the odds to 50% immediately. Of this remaining 50%: <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>        |          Male          |\n        |     a            a     |\n        |------------------------|\nF       |                        |\ne     A |    Aa            Aa    |\nm       |                        |\na       |                        |\nl     a |    aa            aa    |\ne       |                        |\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>50% of the offspring would be affected.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore the probability of V:I being affected is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Question 2<\/h1>\n\n<p>The second question seems very odd to me.

This would make the probability of them having an affected child as 0.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As this isn't one of your options, I assume they mean that IV:2 is a carrier (<em>Aa<\/em>).  We are this time therefore crossing either <em>AA<\/em> or <em>Aa<\/em> (IV:1) with <em>Aa<\/em> (IV:2).  Again, if IV:1 is heterozygous dominant (<em>AA<\/em>) none of her children will be affected.  This means the odds are again reduced by a half.  In the case that she is heterozygous <em>Aa<\/em> then the cross becomes:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>        |          Male          |\n        |     A            a     |\n        |------------------------|\nF       |                        |\ne     A |    AA            Aa    |\nm       |                        |\na       |                        |\nl     a |    Aa            aa    |\ne       |                        |\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Giving 25% healthy, 50% carrier and 25% affected.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As you're looking for affected children: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":10298,"question_id":10294,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc47dee924f403d64c1c3f922669cafb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":6732,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6732/isreal-david","reputation":1,"display_name":"isreal david"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":17432,"edited":false,"creation_date":1400132333,"comment_id":23792,"body":"This is rather a comment than an answer.

I think what we do know about it is that memory storage depends a lot on the physical configuration of the neurons in the brain.  They move about and make new connections as they process information (and probably also when they are not processing information!).  Different regions of the brain store short vs long term memory and different sorts of memories.  They neurons themselves have a lot of internal cell physiology that can change as well - there are many different neuroreceptors that constitute the synaptic junctions. <\/p>\n\n<p>All these things may not be a comprehensive list.  But at the basis of all these processes, the cell expresses new proteins in mRNA and these proteins are doing all this work.  beta-actin and histone de-acetylase, as mentioned in your link, are responsible for the cell rearranging itself in the cell shape and in terms of its internal transport processes and in the nucleus respectively.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure that exactly what is happening here is not really well understood.  monitoring the interior of the cell is difficult.  The <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/article/408075/memories-misplaced-not-lost/\" rel=\"nofollow\">work where histone deacetylase is inhibited<\/a> is a fresh new thought, showing that the arrangement of the chromosomes in the nucleus is involved in hiding memories.  Its still the equivalent to getting a stopped watch to start again by shaking it - there are parts there that fell into place and started ticking again, but we don't really know what the parts are doing in any detail yet.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This hints that if you were to disrupt the cells in some ways you might be able to free up memory, but its a long way from guaranteeing that any given approach will work.  I'd be surprised even if Dr Tsai's cell treatment worked even 70% of the time in her experiment.  Hypnosis or a focused meditation session might still be just as effective.  I think that its a bit too much to expect that Alzheimer's memories are completely preserved and recoverable.  In some cases probably, but categorical statements rarely hold in bioscience. <\/p>\n\n<p>Like a lot of neuroscience, this work is suggestive, but still just progress towards a clearer understanding of these processes.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":17443,"question_id":17381,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17381/the-use-of-proteins-in-memory-creation","last_activity_date":1400174256,"creation_date":1399926950,"answer_count":1,"title":"The use of proteins in memory creation","body":"<p>I have very limited knowledge of how the human memory works as I think, at this time, most people do.

Although the VDW view is still space fill 3D but it's a bit nicer as it has opacity etc etc. Just download it and as soon as you open it up, you are presented with an example alignment and Jmol view. Just play around with the alignment section and the Jmol view and see if you like the aesthetics.

Am I taking the film out too early?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know what you're talking about here. EtBr is a fluorescent dye under UV illumination, and doesn't normally require photographic film. Some systems will capture an image of the gel using a \"Polaroid\" sort of camera, but that works because the gel was exposed to UV light and the incoming light was filtered accordingly. Most systems however use a gel documentation system with a transilluminating tray and digital camera system to take an image.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some things to try:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Prepare two samples: a standard marker lane, and a DNA lane of known concentration (load up a lot of DNA, like 1-2 ug of plasmid to know that you can't miss the band).  Add 1 uL stock EtBr to each lane's sample, mix, then load on the gel. Run the gel using your usual parameters, keeping a eye on the migrating dye front the make sure you don't run the DNA off the gel. This will make sure that you have two good samples that should appear on the gel, and that they are plenty bright by having excess EtBr.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Image the gel. Things to double check here:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>is the emission wavelength correct? EtBr requires short or medium wave UV illumination (250-300 nm), but some systems have long wave illumination as well. Long wave will not work.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>is there filter setting correct? EtBr fluoresces with a red peak (595 nm max), and if a filter is in place to remove this band, you won't see anything either. Usually there is no filter, or an \"EtBr/UV\" filter option. Here's a <a href=\"http://www.syngene.com/assets/doc/Technical-notes/Imaging-Ethidium-bromide-48.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">technical document<\/a> with an example of setting up for EtBr capture.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>is the camera set with an appropriate shutter speed/exposure time? Try experimenting with 20 ms to 200 ms. On our system, 40 ms is ideal. Too short an exposure time means that you won't see anything.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>is the camera iris set the maximally open? If the iris is closed too much, it restricts the incoming light for image formation and eiter no image or a weak image will form. This will also impact ideal exposure time (see above).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>is the camera in focus and operational? Can you image an object like your gloved hand or the physical gel before getting the EtBr settings correct?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":17398,"question_id":15548,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15548/no-bands-show-up-in-gel-electrophoresis-not-even-marker","last_activity_date":1399988947,"creation_date":1394150102,"answer_count":2,"title":"No bands show up in gel electrophoresis, not even marker","body":"<p>I haven't seen any gel lanes in neither my PCR samples nor the marker itself when photographing them.

Both \"ortholog\" and \"orthologue\" are correct, one is the American and the other the British spelling. The same is true for homolog and paralog.<\/p>\n\n<p>On to the biology. Homology is the blanket term, both ortho- and paralogs are homologs. <strong>So, when in doubt use \"homologs\".<\/strong> However:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Orthologs are homologous genes that are the result of a <strong>speciation event<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Paralogs are homologous genes that are the result of a <strong>duplication event<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The following image, adapted (slightly) from [<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vpbDk.png\">1<\/a>], illustrates the differences:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vpbDk.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Part <strong>(a)<\/strong> of the diagram above shows a hypothetical evolutionary history of a gene. The ancestral genome had two copies of this gene (A and B) which were <strong>paralogs<\/strong>. At some point, the ancestral species split into two daughter species, each of whose genomes contain two copies of the ancestral duplicated gene (A1,A2 and B1,B2). <\/p>\n\n<p>These genes are all homologous to one another but are they paralogs or orthologs? Since the duplication event that created genes A and B occurred before the speciation event that created species 1 and 2, A genes will be paralogs of B genes and 1 genes will be orthologs of 2 genes:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A1 and B1 are <strong>paralogs<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>A1 and B2 are <strong>paralogs<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>A2 and B1 are <strong>paralogs<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><p>A2 and B2 are <strong>paralogs<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A1 and A2 are <strong>orthologs<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>B1 and B2 are <strong>orthologs<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This however, is a very simple case. What happens when a duplication occurs <em>after<\/em> a speciation event? In part <strong>(b)<\/strong> of the above diagram, the ancestral gene was duplicated <em>only<\/em> in species 2's lineage. Therefore, in <strong>(b)<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A2 and B2 are <strong>orthologs<\/strong> of A1.<\/li>\n<li>A2 and B2 are <strong>paralogs<\/strong> of each other.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>A common misconception is that paralogous genes are those homologous genes that are in the same genome while orthologous genes are those that are in different genomes. As you can see in the example above, this is absolutely not true. While it <em>can<\/em> happen that way, ortho- vs paralogy depends exclusively on the evolutionary history of the genes involved.

I would <em>highly<\/em> recommend that you check out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Hallmarks of Cancer\">Hallmarks of Cancer<\/a>, the Wikipedia article also cites the interesting original publication. Basically, certain principles underly all cancers, but different cancers have different tendencies to develop certain hallmarks in a particular order.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Randomness of mutations:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations are not random. The nature of DNA sequences affects their susceptibility to DNA <em>lesions<\/em>, i.e. damage caused by chemical processes such as a nucleotide losing its base, dimerisation of thymidine, single or double strand breaks and so on. Lesions occur all the time, so there are mechanisms in place to fix all types of DNA lesions. Occasionally however, the circumstances will permit e.g. two lesions to coincide or the repair process itself to make an error, which then leads to a permanent change of the DNA sequence that cannot be fixed anymore because the original sequence has been lost. This is a <em>mutation<\/em>, and mutations are also not random because the nature of DNA sequences affects the chancefor them to incur lesions that cannot be repaired.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, one reason why certain mutations occur more frequently than others is because they are actually more likely to occur. But this isn't the main reason.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cell self-control<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are higher levels of control than DNA repair. Various mechanisms in the cell exist to detect malfunctioning proteins (due to mutations in their gene) and degrade them - though sometimes malfunctioning proteins can still escape these mechanisms. Even in this case, there is an additional safety layer created by various mechanisms which lead a cell to kill itself (apoptosis). These are triggered for example if excessive DNA damage is detected, or if the cell-internal signals for and against proliferation are conflicting.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sequential accumulation of mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The result of repair and control mechanisms (which I will now call \"defence mechanisms\") is on the one hand that we are far more resistant to mutations than we would be without them. On the other hand however, they create <strong>selection for mutations which are not affected<\/strong> by them.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where multi-hit models of cancer come from. A \"first hit\", \"enabling mutation\" or whatever you want to call it would be a mutation which itself is not affected by defence mechanisms - and simultaneously impairs the defence against other mutation(s). The \"second hit\", \"initiating mutation\",... would be a mutation which causes cancerous cell behaviour, but would be eliminated by a defence mechanism without the first hit.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that mutations do not always occur in the same sequence but rather, they occur in all sequences and sequences other than those that we find in cancer cells are eliminated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that not all cancers have several mutations or a sequence. For example, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, a blood cancer) in the vast majority of cases is caused by a translocation from chromosome 19 to chromosome 22 which results in the famous Philadelphia chromosome and produces the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This single mutation is sufficient to cause CML.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Age-dependency of mutations:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations can affect all parts of a cell's machinery, including the lesion repair mechanisms. This means that throughout its life time, a cell can (and will) accumulate mutations which increase the likelihood of further mutations. Mature cells usually have short life spans and mutations to their DNA repair machinery die with them relatively soon (days or weeks). However, pluripotent stem cells (PSC) in the tissues are just as likely to develop these mutations as mature cells - and PSCs are the ones which renew the tissue throughout life by differentiating into mature cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, a mutation in a PSC remains for life, and the longer you live, the higher the chance that one mutation will affect the chance for gaining further mutations. This is why for all cancer types, the risk to develop them increases with age (though there are a few which are most likely at young age!)<\/p>\n","answer_id":17262,"question_id":17208,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1399582526}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17208/why-cancer-mutations-do-accumulate-sequentially","last_activity_date":1399761128,"creation_date":1399405014,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why cancer mutations do accumulate sequentially?","body":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudson_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knudson hypothesis<\/a>, cancer mutations accumulate in order.

The four bases are able to copy with high reliability because two features combine to exclude mis-pairings: there are two size classes - meaning any purine-purine or pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairing results in incorrect separation between the strands, excluding A-G and C-U bonds; and there are two classes based on number of OH-bonds - which limits the potential for A-C and G-U bonds. More bases must, inevitably, weaken the strength of these exclusionary approaches and increase the number of mispairings. RNA world replicators will have lacked the sophisticated repair and error checking mechanisms of modern lifeforms so this increase in mispairings would likely not be corrected.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, a two base system would be even more capable of reducing errors. I suggest that the advantage of the four base system is that it allows for much more complex 3-dimensional structure to form in RNA and thus enabled a broader range of catalytic capabilities.

It approaches the problem from Claude Shannon's theory for communication. It treats DNA replication conceptually and mathematically the same as a data transmission. It concludes that the system of four bases, not two, not six, replicates the most genetic information at the shortest amount of time. <\/p>\n\n<p>The communicational analogy goes like this. If you have two data transmission systems, one can transmit, say, 1 MB per second, and the other can do 2 MB per second but cost less than twice as much. The answer is obvious you will buy the second service for a higher rate per cost. As a data service, it does not care what information you consume -- it can be spam, video, audio, etc. All that matters is the transmission rate. As for DNA replication, it is like a data transmission channel when one base is replicated a time along the mother DNA template. It too does not care whether the process is for a bacterium genome, or a plant, or an animal genome. The pay-off is in information and the cost is in time. Unlike your abiotic communication varieties, time is both the sender and the receiver of all messages of life, and different life forms or species are merely time's cell phones. So if one system can replicate more information in a unit time than another, the faster one will win the evolutionary arm race. A prey operating on a slow replicator system will not be able to compete with nor to adapt to a predator operating on a fast one. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now because the A-T pair has only two weak hydrogen bonds but the C-G pair has three, A and T take a shorter time to complete duplication than the C and G do. Although the replication time is short in some fraction of nano second, but the time adds up quickly for genomes with base pairs in the billions. So having the C-G pair may slow down the replication, but the gain is in information. One base pair gives you 1 bit per base information. Two pairs gives you 2 bits per base information. But, having more base pairs may eventually run into a diminished return in information replication rate if the new bases take too long a time to replicate. Hence the consideration for the optimal rate of replication measured in information bits per base per time. Without information there would be no diversity, no complexity. Without replication in information there would be no life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using a simple transmission/replication rate calculation by Shannon you can calculate the mean rate for the AT-system, the CG-system, the ATCG-system, and for some hypothetical 6-bases, 2n-bases system whose new bases take progressively longer time to replicate. The analysis shows the ATCG-system has the optimal replication rate if the CG bases take 1.65 to 3 times longer to replicate than the AT bases. That is, a base-2 system replicates its bases faster but does not carry more information to have a higher bit rate. Likewise, a base-6 system has a greater per-base information but replicate slower on average to end up with a suboptimal bit rate.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NLxOG.jpg\" alt=\"DNA Replication Rate\"><\/p>\n\n<p>According to a comparison from the paper, the base-4 system is about 40% faster than the  A\u2013T only system, and 133% faster than the G\u2013C only system. Assume life on Earth started about 4 billion years ago, then the A-T only system would set back evolution by 1 billion years, the G\u2013C system would do so by 2.3 billion years. For a hypothetical base-6 system, it would do so by 80 million years. In other words, life is where it should be because the base-4 system is able to transmit information through the time bottleneck at the optimal  bit rate. <\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, life is to replicate the most information with the shortest time, and the base-4 system does it the best. If ever there were other systems they would have lost the informatic competition to the base-4 system from the get-go. Darwin's principle works at life's most basic and most important level.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are other explanations, all non-Darwinian. Most are based on the base's molecular structures. But these types of explanation border on circular argument -- using observations to explain themselves. They also face this catch-22 problem since there is no way to exhaust all possible bases for replication. However, such lines of exploration are fruitful regardless because more knowledge the better. But without taking information and its replication into consideration it is hard to imagine a sensible answer to the question.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8304,"question_id":2874,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1368554245}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2874/why-are-there-exactly-four-nucleobases-in-dna","last_activity_date":1399720177,"creation_date":1342058345,"answer_count":4,"title":"Why are there exactly four nucleobases in DNA?","body":"<p>Does someone know why DNA is composed of four nucleobases?

Now to make a species extinct you would have to find each individual and kill it. Or you may have to develop a technology that will identify and kill a certain species in an automated manner. This is difficult to implement; how to engineer a mechanism that will precisely seek and destroy <em>all the epitope sensors<\/em> for a particular antigen. In contrast selection happens spontaneously because it does not proceed with a reason. It just selects the best from available stock. <\/p>\n","answer_id":17300,"question_id":17296,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1399712624}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17296/why-is-there-no-way-to-remove-an-immune-response","last_activity_date":1399712624,"creation_date":1399688872,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why is there no way to remove an immune response?","body":"<p>We've known for a long time now how to \"add a new entry to the database,\" as it were, of immune responses.
