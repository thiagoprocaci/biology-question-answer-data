Feb 2012)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More recently, in a major conceptual shift, ROS have been found to be\n  physiologically vital for signal transduction, gene regulation, and\n  redox regulation, among others, implying that their complete\n  elimination would be harmful. An alternative notion, advocated here,\n  termed the \"redox stress hypothesis,\" proposes that aging-associated\n  functional losses are primarily caused by a progressive pro-oxidizing\n  shift in the redox state of the cells, which leads to the\n  overoxidation of redox-sensitive protein thiols and the consequent\n  disruption of the redox-regulated signaling mechanisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Many proteins contain cysteine residues which can undergo reversible modifications such as S-nitrosylation and S-glutationylation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The redox state affects the oxidation levels of these redox-sensitive protein thiols and the consequent disruption in protein activity and the redox-regulated signaling mechanisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under normal conditions the usual types of oxidation modifications of these protein thiols are reversible, and is a way to protect the thiol in transient periods of oxidative stress.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the redox state shifts to a more oxidised point then more irreversiable protein thiol modifications occurs, i.e. damages the protein.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As shown in Figure 6, prolonged exposure of sulfenic acid, formed at\n  the active or regulatory sites, to H2O2, sequentially leads to the\n  formation of sulfinic- (−SO2H) and sulfonic-acids (−SO3H), which are\n  deemed to be largely irreversible reactions. In addition, protein\n  disulfides may undergo over-oxidation, leading to the formation of\n  thiosulfenate and thiosulfonate, which are also believed to be\n  relatively irreversible reactions. The level of oxidation of protein\n  cysteinyl thiolates depends upon the strength (concentration) and the\n  duration of exposure to H2O2.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Protein activity and enzyme catalytic efficiency which affects metabolism, such as sirtuins, are affected by the these thiol redox modifications.\n(eg <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20385619\" rel=\"nofollow\">SIRT1 is a redox-sensitive deacetylase that is post-translationally modified by oxidants and carbonyl stress<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451382\" rel=\"nofollow\">A redox-resistant sirtuin-1 mutant protects against hepatic metabolic and oxidant stress.<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary arbiter of redox state is glutathione, i.e. the GSH/GSSG couple. The effect of anti-oxidants appears to vary depending on whether it affects the redox state.<\/p>\n\n<p>The antioxidant activities of SOD and catalase neutralize the ROS species, O2− and H2O2, without having a direct impact on glutathione redox state.  However this frees up glutathione from having to neutralize the ROS species, which it can do so with the glutathione peroxidase enzyme.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21781,"question_id":2382,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1412150393}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2382/how-do-antioxidants-affect-human-metabolism","last_activity_date":1412173286,"creation_date":1337902284,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do antioxidants affect human metabolism?","body":"<p>I'd like to know how antioxidants affect human metabolism and which ones are essential for metabolic processes.<\/p>\n","question_id":2382,"tags":["human-biology","biochemistry","molecular-biology","metabolism"],"score":11,"accepted_answer_id":2412,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":839,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1412173286},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hm9Ku.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9580,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9580/sarah-ferguson","reputation":111,"display_name":"sarah.ferguson"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15894a0d103ab92a2cd3b1000efca418?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6422,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6422/cornelius","reputation":6008,"display_name":"Cornelius"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1412164812,"creation_date":1412164812,"body":"<p>Forgetfulness is a common phenomenon that tends to increase with age.

(Some people lump the two; it's easier to think of them independently, because they really do quite different things.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Proprioception (and closely associated <em>kinesthetics<\/em>) is possible because of nerve signals from skin, tendons, muscles, and joints. This gives us the senses of limb position and movement, the sense of tension or force, the sense of effort, the sense of <em>gravity<\/em>.<sup>[1]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Patients (lacking proprioceptive feedback) made large directional and amplitude errors when performing a reaching task without visual feedback....The errors were associated with differences in velocity and acceleration for movements in different directions.<sup>[2]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, without proprioception, you could not touch your little finger to your thumb without visual input, let alone actually perform more complex voluntary movements successfully.<\/p>\n\n<p>The vestibular system exists through input from three semicircular canals located in the inner ear on each side. The canals are oriented at (basically) 90° angles to each other so that we can maintain our balance no matter which position our head is in. These are also connected to one's ocular reflexes. Together they're called the vestibolo-occular system, which functions as a reflex (VOR).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Three sensory systems, vestibular, visual, and somatosensory/proprioceptive, serve our sense of balance. Each of these systems provides unique sensory information to the brain where it is integrated (often in complex ways) to produce a final motor output to muscle groups for maintaining gaze, head and body posture, and controlling static and dynamic balance.<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Without these systems, we would be completely unable to get or stay in a standing position. We certainly could not walk.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, long story short, the answer is no. Not only is it surgically impossible, but if it were, you would not have a coordinated, working body left.

Refraction is the process by which the optical system focuses images of objects on the retina, which are then transmitted to the visual cortex of the brain to be interpreted as vision. The major components of refraction are the cornea, lens, and axial eye length (distance from the front to the back of the eye). The problem in myopia is that images are focused anterior to the retina, like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IQ307.gif\" alt=\"myopia\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Causes of myopia<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>You ask<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't really understand the exact mechanism responsible for the transition from 1 [ciliary muscle spasm] to 2 [elongation of the eye].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Swelling or spasm of the ciliary body (the circumferential tissue inside the eye composed of the ciliary muscle and ciliary processes) can be seen after trauma or in inflammatory conditions. Contraction of the ciliary muscles causes decreased tension in the suspensory ligaments that connect the ciliary body to the lens. The results in the lens becoming more rounded and/or moving anteriorly. Both processes also bring the focal point more anterior, i.e. further in front of the retina, resulting in a configuration as in the picture above. You could call this \"elongation of the eye\" if you wanted. <a href=\"http://blausen.com/?Topic=8723\">This 25 second video<\/a> explains the process succinctly with pretty pictures.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although interesting to think on, this is not the most common cause of myopia. Myopia is an extremely common condition, occurring in ~25% of the US population. Myopia can be classified as axial or refractive.   <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Axial myopia<\/strong>: The refracting power of the eye is normal but the length of the eye is too long.   <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Refractive myopia<\/strong>: The length of the eye is normal, but the lens refracts too much for a given axial length. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Both axial and refractive myopia are usually caused by failure of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmetropia\">emmetropization<\/a>, the process by which a normal eye has coordinated growth of its refractive components. This process takes place mostly during the childhood and adolescent years, which is why myopia most commonly develops during that time. There are certain disease conditions that increase lens power (e.g. osmotic effects in diabetes) or axial length (e.g. posterior staphyloma) that may also cause myopia at other points in life, but these are less common.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>\nReferences:  <\/p>\n\n<p><\/sub>\n<sub>\n1.

It's not the telomeres themselves that are the problem, but broad spectrum DNA damage and transcriptional changes. The condition of the telomeres doesn't directly affect the likelihood of a cell growth becoming more cancer-like. A cell with perfect telomeres fresh from a telomerase-expressing stem cell and cell with shortened telomeres have an equal chance of becoming cancerous. Cell populations with longer telomeres have 'more time' or more chances to develop mutations and cell expression damage, however. You're more likely to get in a car crash if you go to the store across town  than the neighborhood convenience store, even though it's not intrinsically more dangerous per mile driven. <\/p>\n\n<p>The sunburn example can be a little misleading. It's not cell regrowth that's the key carcinogenic factor, but instead the direct DNA damage UV radiation can cause. In a particularly bad sunburn your skin cells may be killed or commit suicide(apoptosis) because of the DNA damage they've sustained. If the cells are damaged but do not die, they're likely to recover. Over time and repeated sun exposure, the skin cells that are most resistant to orders from the body to stop growing or die stick around and may grow and divide. Freckles are when this happens to a population of skin cells that ignore orders about how much brown pigment to be, but still listen to the orders that instruct them on how to be skin. When they stop listening to the skin orders, they officially become precancerous.<\/p>\n\n<p>The acid reflux example is excellent. There are populations of stem cells throughout the adult body that produce skin cells and hair follicles and blood cells and all the other kinds of cells that are more or less expendable. Generally speaking these stem cells don't have do very much work replenishing esophagus cells, so when they are taxed by something killing off the esophagus lining regularly, they can 'break down' and lose control of their own replication. <\/p>\n\n<p>It seems like you're both pretty interested in cellular mechanisms of cancer and a little shaky on current theories of cancer formation(there are a few), so if there's a section of this answer that needs to be more detailed or followup questions please let me know.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21714,"question_id":21713,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21713/about-excessive-cellular-growth","last_activity_date":1411886776,"creation_date":1411880120,"answer_count":1,"title":"About excessive cellular growth","body":"<p>When there is 'excessive' cell growth 'ordered' by the human body in some specific part of the body that is not part of the usual repairing mechanisms, does this cause extra telomere 'shortening' or damage even though a lot of cell growth and repair is 'required'.

The mechanisms that might occur (that I can think of) are:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) if the Australians had some rare genetic traits that became more common in the australian gene pool than in the UK gene pool, it is possible.  This is what happened with eastern Asia and the Y chromosome, which something like 40% from a single individual.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For this to be the case, it would be necessary that:  Australia's gene pool must be isolated - very little immigration to the company and mixing with other gene pools.  (i think not- what do you say?)<\/p>\n\n<p>2) the diet of Australians caused their general body or face to be distinctive.  As there is a lot of fast food in Australia now (and obesity) I'm guessing that this is simply not the case, at least compared to the UK and US. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since there is no direct study (that I can find) all we can go on is anecdotal thought experiment. <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as cognitive bias goes, I'm Asian American and I've heard many many (maybe most Asians say that they can tell one nationality vs another just by appearance).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Whenever I have tested myself or others I have not found anyone who can tell that i am 100% Japanese genetically.  This is probably because diet in the midwest where i grew up was so corn rich and I've been mistaken for nearly everything, including Latino backgrounds.  Most people think I'm Filipino, which is great except that I am not :)  <\/p>\n\n<p>Even when I ask Asians to look at other Asians and guess, it seems pretty rare that one can be consistently correct.  There has been a lot of gene migration between countries there, even though the national groups are much much older than Australia.  This is why I really doubt that Australians have been genetically isolated long enough or strongly enough for this to really be likely. <\/p>\n\n<p>It would be pretty simple to get a bunch of pictures together, say 100, and test this if you really want to know.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1334,"question_id":1311,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1331160659},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b324e4900e79878eb518c1263b41795?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":129,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/129/piotr-migdal","reputation":1124,"display_name":"Piotr Migdal","accept_rate":50},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":1344,"edited":false,"creation_date":1331239996,"comment_id":1643,"body":"As much as I like that &quot;average face&quot; link, it only remains an exercise in style.

This means blood can no longer exit the venules of the appendix normally. In the presence of ongoing arterial flow, this leads to vascular engorgement, worsening the distention and increasing pressure further. The inflammatory process spreads from the lumen (inside) of the appendix to the serosa (outside) and then to the parietal peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity). This last step is what causes the characteristic shift in pain from poorly localized visceral pain to focal right lower quadrant pain. <\/p>\n\n<p>As distention worsens, arterial pressure is eventually exceeded, and the most poorly vascularized areas of the appendix (generally just beyond the point of obstruction on the antimesenteric border) infarct first. Dead tissue has very little structural integrity, and once infarction happens perforation is likely to follow quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why this is (sometimes) lethal<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are several possible mechanisms, more than one of which is probably operative in most cases. <\/p>\n\n<p>The three I have listed below all converge on the same final common pathway: In the absence of adequate systemic blood pressure (shock), the heart is not able to pump normally and will eventually deteriorate into a non-perfusing rhythm (a.k.a death).<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Bacteria in the peritoneal cavity<\/strong>:\nAs in bowel perforation of any cause (e.g. perforated peptic ulcer, perforated diverticulum, traumatic perforation), bacteria in the peritoneal cavity (the \u201cfree space\u201d outside the bowel within the abdomen) triggers an intense inflammatory reaction and fluid sequestration. Fluid pulled from the circulation into the peritoneal space causes hypotension and (hypovolemic) shock.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Infarcted bowel<\/strong>: Dead tissue connected to the body is never a good situation. Intracellular contents are released into the bloodstream \u2013 electrolyte release can cause hyperkalemia and other electrolyte imbalances; reactive oxygen species can lead to hypotension and (distributive) shock.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Sepsis<\/strong>: Bacteria (generally gram negative rods from among normal gut flora \u2013 most commonly Escherichia coli or Bacteroides fragilis)\nmay enter the bloodstream due to compromised vessels during the process of infarction and rupture. Lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall of gram-negative bacterial organisms lead to activation of monocytes and macrophages. This results in increased levels of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor and eventually of IL-6 and IL-8. These cause widespread endothelial injury leading to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_alveolar_damage\" rel=\"nofollow\">diffuse alveolar damage<\/a> in the lungs and activation of the coagulation system leading to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000573.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">disseminated intravascular coagulation<\/a>.

Of course other nuclear incidents have occurred, but usually give much higher doses to far fewer people.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many studies have been done on the survivors from the atomic bomb attacks, and increased rates of cancer have been the strongest conclusion. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19454804\" rel=\"nofollow\">This review article<\/a> looks at those studies for both cancer and non-cancer effects. Leukemia is the most well known cancer to be caused by radiation, and excess leukemia was discovered in bomb survivors within 5 years of the attacks. Rates of most solid tumors had increased by 10 years after the attacks. However \"Even 55 years after the\nbombings over 40% of the Life Span Study cohort remain alive\", indicating that the amount of radiation most people were exposed to wasn't enough to kill them. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12852470\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is another article on atomic bomb survivors.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The Chernobyl accident was a very different type of exposure, but many people were exposed to radioactive materials. Immediately after the disaster, the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_%28Chernobyl%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">liquidators<\/a>\" received high doses of radiation while cleaning up the site and building the containment structures, but very few have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster\" rel=\"nofollow\">died<\/a> from radiation exposure. While the environment around the power plant did suffer in the years after the accident, after the humans moved away the environment has greatly improved. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Belarus_radioactivity_and_thyroid_cancer.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thyroid cancer rates increased<\/a> due to Iodine-131 exposure, especially among those exposed as children, but rates were still low.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DEhMu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> Yellow = adults Blue = Adolescents Red = Children.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is too soon to draw many conclusions about the Fukushima accident, but some studies (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251702\" rel=\"nofollow\">7<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24361922\" rel=\"nofollow\">8<\/a>) have tried to predict the number of cancer cases that will be caused by it. In general the rates are expected to be low, with far fewer deaths than were caused by the earthquake and tsunami that caused the accident.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few instances exposed small numbers of people to very high doses, and are interesting from a radiation safety veiwpoint. The infamous \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demon Core<\/a>\" killed 2 scientists in separate accidents while handling the core. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia_accident\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goiania incident<\/a> involved men breaking into an old hospital and stealing a radiation source without realizing what it was. They broke the source open and passed the radioactive material around because it looked cool, resulting in several deaths due to acute radiation sickness.<\/p>\n\n<p>While radiation can be dangerous, with proper precautions we can avoid accidents and disasters. Remember that Chernobyl was a poorly designed Soviet reactor, and that Fukushima was a 50 year old plant that needed both a magnitude 9 earthquake and a 30 foot wave to disable it. Modern nuclear plants can be built safely and provide clean electricity for many decades, and if they are breeder reactors can recycle the used fuel to reduce both the amount and half-life of the material, making storage easier.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21680,"question_id":21677,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21677/how-well-understood-are-the-long-term-effects-of-nuclear-radiation","last_activity_date":1411743994,"creation_date":1411737617,"answer_count":1,"title":"How well understood are the long-term effects of nuclear radiation?","body":"<p>Sometimes, when people are concerned about radiation, it is not because it is precisely quantified how dangerous it is, but because we don't know how dangerous it is.<\/p>\n\n<p>How well understood are the long-term effects of nuclear radiation, for example on cancer?

However, if you want to look at where this is the norm and try to build a mathematical theory then you need to look at something much smaller; the prime candidate is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation\">affinity maturation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the human immune system, when exposed to an antigen B cells produce antibodies. If it is your first exposure to the antigen then the antibodies produced will probably have very low binding affinity. However, after some exposure time, your B cells will start to produce antibodies with much higher affinities for the antigen and thus you will be able to better fight off the disease. The cool part, is that <strong>the antigen produced is tune via an evolutionary process<\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n<p>There is differential survival, with only antibodies with the highest affinity being able to survive. Variability is introduced by a very high mutation rate in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity-determining_regions\">complementarity determing region<\/a> (CDR). (Tonegawa, 1983). The length of this evolutionary process is very short, typically a local equilibrium is found after only 6-8 nucleotide changes in CDR (Crews et al., 1981; Tonegawa, 1983; Clark et al., 1985), so you need only a few point mutations to quickly develop a drastically better tuned antibody.<\/p>\n\n<p>The standard mathematical model for this is Kauffman's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK_model\">NK model<\/a>. With a protein sequence on $N$ sites, we say that evolution is fast (and we have a sudden leap) if after our fitness landscape changes, we can get to a new local equilibrium in a number of generations that scales with $\\log N$. Kauffman &amp; Weinberger (1989) showed how this model can be used to study affinity maturation, and showed that to achieve a sudden leap we need high <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis\">epistasis<\/a> and low correlations between pointwise mutants. In particular, their model suggests that typical epistasis in the CDR is on the order of 40 proteins (out of the total 112 proteins in the CDR).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>References<\/h2>\n\n<p>Clark, S.H., Huppi, K., Ruezinsky, D., Staudt, L., Gerhard, W., &amp; Weigert, M.

Drinking <em><strong>only<\/strong><\/em> this kind of water and ingesting nothing else will eventually be fatal because it is highly hypotonic as you've found out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Salt balance in the body is largely maintained by passive diffusion. Salts diffuse from areas of relatively high concentration (eg, stomach) down to areas of low concentration. For example, if you have just eaten a meal, the stomach contents are relatively higher in salt concentration compared to the surrounding tissue and the blood. Salt diffuses out of the stomach and into the stomach lining, intestines and blood. Tissues have to make sure they don't get too much salt or they will take in too much water and burst, so they have active transport mechanisms to remove excess salts and they go into the blood as well. Now that the excess salts are carried in the blood, they ultimately get filtered at the kidneys and excreted in urine. The kidneys are able to filter the salt by taking advantage of this gradient moving salt once again from high to low concentrations. The exact details are not important for this discussion, other than to know the kidneys need a highly concentrated store of salt to function.<\/p>\n\n<p>Distilled water on the other hand, has no salt. It is pure water. Distilled water will pull salt out of the tissues because now it is the absolute lowest concentration of salt. Tissues will also take in a lot of this water because it too passively diffuses and it is hypotonic. When this happens in the blood, red blood cells tend to burst because they can't tolerate a terribly large change in tonicity, and so some red blood cells die. The other problem is also that the salt control mechanisms in the kidneys malfunction because too much salt gets leeched out of them and passed in your urine.<\/p>\n\n<p>After drinking too much distilled water, electrolytes and important minerals get leeched out of your body and this creates electrical abnormalities in your body leading to irregular and weak heart beats (from hyponatremia and hypokalemia), poor muscle strength, high blood pressure and fatigue. Distilled water as mentioned, is fairly acidity (can be as low as pH 3 when freshly distilled) and leads to acidification of the blood (acidosis).<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no exact amount of water that one needs to drink to die. This mode of death is related to hyperhydration/water intoxication. This can happen from over-hydrating with regular tap water, but will take longer than distilled water because of the salt content in tap water.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2253,"question_id":2250,"up_vote_count":37,"last_edit_date":1411740496},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e79dfa072f03c5e987515cabb1db22e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1586,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1586/tonyh","reputation":252,"display_name":"TonyH"},"score":12,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1351397068,"creation_date":1351397068,"body":"<p>I'm not sure why no one mentions this, but any food you eat would negate this effect entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming then, that you had no food, the lack of minerals in this pure water would simply be another deprivation for your body.

The only place where concentrations of distilled water would ever be high enough to conceivably matter is in the tissues of the mouth and throat, and even there, the effect would be temporary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Compare drinking 8 glasses of either distilled or tap water every day.  <a href=\"http://www.mgwater.com/mgrank.shtml\">With tap water<\/a>, you're looking at less than 200 ppm of Mg, Na, K, and Ca combined.  That's less than 400mg of total mineral content per day.  Given that the combined RDA of all of those minerals is on the order of <a href=\"http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/5_Summary%20Table%20Tables%201-4.pdf\">7g for an adult male<\/a>, this is not <em>nothing<\/em>, but it's certainly small.  Your dietary intake of these minerals probably varies by more than this daily, and your intestines, kidneys, sweat glands and mineral storage organs (like your bones and muscles) are constantly maintaining the mineral blood levels within a <em>very<\/em> narrow range, despite handling a throughput of several pounds of water and food daily.  They might have to work slightly harder to manage this range if you drank nothing but distilled water, but in a healthy adult, normal intakes already vary by more than this amount without major problems.  For example, the average American <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/dssodium/\">consumes more than 3.4 grams of sodium daily<\/a>, while a <a href=\"http://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/guidelines_for_a_low_sodium_diet/index.html\">low-sodium diet is on the order of 2g<\/a>.  Low-sodium diets have been widely studied in the medical literature, and are considered safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for pH, the lowered pH is caused by increased carbon-dioxide absorption to form carbonic acid.  Just as carbon dioxide is more soluble in distilled water, it is less soluble in stomach acid, and may be burped out.  Would you die of acidosis from drinking seltzer water all the time?  If that were the case, I'm sure there would be big health warnings about drinking soda, <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-07/will-drinking-carbonated-beverages-weaken-my-bones\">while it seems relatively benign<\/a>.

I presume that figure comes not from theorising about salt intake, but from giving measured quantities of distilled water to rats and counting how many die.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's likely of the same order of magnitude for humans. Unlike many \"poisons\" it's not about subtleties of liver chemistry that will vary by species. What killed the rats was the swelling by osmosis of cells and tissues that they didn't want swelled.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a largeish human that dose is 7 litres, approx 14 pints, drunk at a sitting.

In particular the one everybody thinks of (because, like the water, it's similar to something they know about): lab ethanol can have methanol as an impurity, and may well have had benzene intentionally added because that's an easy way to get the last 4.5% water out that otherwise cannot be removed by distillation. A mouthful of ethanol isn't normally lethal (although it might be illegal), whereas methanol and benzene are both \"properly\" toxic in the sense that a few grams will kill you.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, I can confirm that in my school days I obtained the same experimental result you did.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19645,"question_id":2250,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1411642027}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2250/death-because-of-distilled-water-consumption","last_activity_date":1411740496,"creation_date":1336918259,"answer_count":4,"title":"Death because of distilled water consumption","body":"<p>One of my friends said that I would die if I drank distilled water (we were using it in a chemistry experiment) I gave it a go and surprisingly did not die.<\/p>\n\n<p>I did a bit of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=drinking+disti%3Blled+water+harmful%3F#hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PLyvT9PvPMSIrAesu8mJBA&amp;ved=0CB4QvwUoAQ&amp;q=drinking+distilled+water+harmful%3F&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=311369616e4b455a&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=652\">Googling<\/a> and found <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060919161158AAWqN9V\">this<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>It said that drinking only this kind of water could definitely cause death, as distilled water was highly hypotonic and it would make the blood cells expand and finally explode and ultimately cause death.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wanted to know exactly how much of this water on an average was needed to be consumed to cause death. <\/p>\n","question_id":2250,"tags":["human-biology","biochemistry","experimental"],"score":56,"accepted_answer_id":2253,"down_vote_count":2,"protected_date":1364152803,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46489,"up_vote_count":58,"last_edit_date":1411736952},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGJOV.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6682,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6682/shooting-squirrel","reputation":176,"display_name":"shooting-squirrel","accept_rate":57},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGJOV.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6682,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6682/shooting-squirrel","reputation":176,"display_name":"shooting-squirrel","accept_rate":57},"score":0,"post_id":21626,"edited":false,"creation_date":1412033979,"comment_id":34401,"body":"Sorry to bother again, did you find out by chance whether the upc ratio test is time sensitive or not?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":21626,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGJOV.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6682,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6682/shooting-squirrel","reputation":176,"display_name":"shooting-squirrel","accept_rate":57},"edited":false,"creation_date":1412050733,"comment_id":34415,"body":"@shooting-squirrel Since the quality of the sample is what could be affected after the aforesaid time period.

Proteins are a chain of linked amino acids. This chain can be grouped into functional units which are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain\">protein domains<\/a>. Usually all parts of a domain are closely located in the protein and they form functional domains in the 3D structure of the protein. Proteins usually contain more than one domain (these are manifold but for example can be dimerization, activation or binding domains).<\/p>\n\n<p>The catalytic domain is the part of the protein chain which contains the region where the catalyzed chemical reaction takes place. The 3D structure of the catalytic domain forms the active site, so the enzyme requires proper folding to be active. If you denature the enzyme, the catalytic domain will still be present (as this is a function of the protein sequence) but the active site will be gone.<\/p>\n\n<p>As there are really many enzymes for all kinds of reactions it is hard to define a general form for the active site. A motif which is present in a lot of enzymes is the the form of a catalytic pocket or groove to which only the correct substrate of the enzyme has access. Additionally the binding of the substrate to the enzyme often induces a conformational change in the protein which closes this pocket. When the reaction is finished and the substrate is not bound anymore by the enzyme, the conformation changes again and releases the products of the reaction.

Viruses can infect all types of life\n  forms, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically speaking you have a piece of genetic information (DNA or RNA) which encodes proteins which are important for the function of the virus and a hull (not always, but mostly). These invade a cell type, take over the cell (litarally, after an infection the cell will mostly only make viral proteins and DNA/RNA). Finally new viruses are built inside the cell and released to infect more cells. In principle this works like in the figure below (from <a href=\"http://www.intechopen.com/books/lipid-metabolism/lipid-involvement-in-viral-infections-present-and-future-perspectives-for-the-design-of-antiviral-st\">here<\/a>): <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjvB3.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>There are two possibilities for cures: The first one are vaccinations. Here you either use dead or attenuated viruses (or parts of viruses) to train the immune system. When this has happened, the immune system \"knows\" this specific agent and can rise a fast and highly specific immune answer against it, before the virus can replicate in high numbers and infect a lot of cells.

First, although more women are delaying pregnancy until after the age of 35, the overall percentage of women doing so remains very small, as shown by this figure from this <a href=\"http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/pregnancy-rates-rise-for-women-over-40/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times article<\/a>.

I make below a quick summary and apply it to your question but I think it is worth looking at the other post on aging.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In short: Theory of aging<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a deleterious (=negative) allele (=variant of a gene) that is expressed throughout the lifetime. This allele (by definition of a deleterious allele) will decrease the reproductive success of the carrier. Now consider another allele who is expressed only late in life, maybe after the first reproduction but before the second reproduction. This allele will decrease the reproductive success of the carrier but by a lower magnitude that did the allele that was acting throughout the lifetime so that it is more likely for this second allele to rise in frequency in the population to the point of becoming fixed (=reaching a frequency of 100%). In other words, natural selection is less strong on alleles acting late in life.  i.e. deleterious alleles acting late in life are more likely to get fixed resulting in the expression of many disease late in life. In the worst case, we can talk about alleles that are expressed after the time of the last reproduction. These alleles are not at all selected against (I make abstraction of kin selection here). Therefore, we should not be able to live long after the age of reproduction. non-reproductive grandmothers is kind of an exception and is explained by kin selection but I don't want to go into these details. Also, today's medicine explain why we live so long even after the last reproduction. For example articulation related disease that we experience at older age is often caused by this kind of alleles that are expressed only late in life. You can also consider alleles that are beneficial early in life but detrimental at the end of the life. THeir probability of fixation is even greater and these alleles have already been observed in nature.

Well, this will increase the selection against alleles that are expressed late in life and in the long run this will increase human lifespan (or at least it will increase the time during which humans are healthy). So yes, your hypothesis is right. However, as a sidenote, medicine may mess things up in the story!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it plausible that humans will start delaying their reproduction age?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For consideration of whether it is likely that the human population decide to delay their reproduction age, see @MikeTaylor's answer.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21646,"question_id":21579,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1411652205}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21579/do-couples-having-children-later-in-life-act-as-an-evolutionary-mechanism","last_activity_date":1411652205,"creation_date":1411517380,"answer_count":2,"title":"Do couples having children later in life act as an evolutionary mechanism?","body":"<p>Ok, this may be just wild nonsense and I have to warn that my knowledge on the subject is limited.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was reading about how in some countries people choose to have children later in life.

Cortisol (Hydrocortisone) is the active form, while cortison is not. See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21465/what-is-the-physiological-difference-between-cortisone-and-cortisol\">here<\/a> for some more details.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol#Immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glucocorticoids<\/a> (like Cortisol or Prednisolone) suppress acute inflammation and also have immuno modulative (downregulate) or suppressive function. Since the immune system causes the problems in Psoriasis it is downregulated to control the outcome of the disease.<\/p>\n\n<p>First it sounds counterintuitive to use Glucocorticoids for the treatment of psoriasis as this hormone is released during stress (in this case to mobilize energy resources). However, there is a study which looked precisely at the cortisol levels in psoriasis patients and also recorded their stress levels. <\/p>\n\n<p>What they found was interesting: First they could correlate the peaks in the stress levels with a psoriasis attack about four weeks later. Then they found that the Cortisol levels of the patients where significantly lower in stres situations than for healthy control persons. Additionally they found that patients which had permenant high stress levels also showed significantly lower permanent Cortisol levels. So here the stress seems to negatively influence the cortisol levels which then prepares the way for psoriasis attacks. Using high levels of topically administered Cortisol seems to reverse this effect.\nYou can find the study here: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/evers2010\" rel=\"nofollow\">How stress gets under the skin: cortisol and stress reactivity in\npsoriasis.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":21604,"question_id":21603,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1411583743}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21603/why-is-psoriasis-treated-with-cortisone-when-stress-which-releases-cortisol-i","last_activity_date":1411636429,"creation_date":1411580182,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is Psoriasis treated with Cortisone, when stress (which releases Cortisol) is known to aggravate the condition?","body":"<p>It is well known that stress isn't good for psoriasis , yet why do we treat the illness with Cortisone, a compound very similar to cortisol (and \"has a similar name, genesis, and function\", according to wikipedia) whilst cortisol is released in the body in stress situations?<\/p>\n","question_id":21603,"tags":["human-biology","endocrinology"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":21604,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":414,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1411636429},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6797d6e2bab5da8a5793a1056cbab094?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5978,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5978/fremmedehenvendelser","reputation":121,"display_name":"fremmedehenvendelser"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":16352,"edited":false,"creation_date":1396702851,"comment_id":22055,"body":"Under the current conditions and without an athmosphere?

So, for example for a restriction enzyme with a 4-base recognition sequence such as AluI (AGCT) the probability is 1/256 and so the average length of an AluI fragment would be 256 bp. For an enzyme with a 6-base recognition sequence such as HindIII (AAGCTT) the corresponding number is 4096 bp.

However the most likely way out of the co-migration problem would be to purify the two comigrating fragments as a mixture and then ligate them into a vector whereupon each recombinant would carry one or other of the two fragments.

It is indeed possible to cut out a small square from the gel which contains the band, and then dissolve the gel and extract the genetic material. Sequencing the result would give you one of two outcomes: 1) If the band contained only your desired sequence, your sequencing technique should render exactly that sequence as a result. 2) If the band contained more than one different sequences of the same length, your sequencing method will probably leave you with ambiguous results.<\/p>\n\n<p>So sequencing would probably only confirm whether or not the band contained a single distinct sequence. It would not be useful as a method of separating the sequence you want for future experiments from any other sequence of the same length. One method to do this could be PCR (polymerase chain reaction), a procedure that produces vast numbers (billions) of copies of a specific target sequence. If a PCR was carried out to amplify the target sequence contained in the gel band, any other sequences of the same length would not have any copies produced.

Probably the most famous example is that of bacteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>What you're talking about is known as <em>asexual reproduction<\/em>. In bacteria, the process is known as <em>binary fission<\/em>, where one bacterium (known as the <em>parent cell<\/em>) divides into two organisms (known as <em>daughter cells<\/em>). These two cells will be genetically identical (barring any mutations) to the parent cell, because there has been no combination (for lack of a better term) of DNA, as there is in sexual reproduction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The process works the same way it does in cells in multicellular organisms, such as humans: DNA \"unwinds\" (again due to lack of a better term) in the center of the cell, complementary bases are added to each of the now-separate strands (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine), the other parts of the cell are duplicated, and, gradually, the bacterium splits in two. The process can be very quick, compared to the nine months humans spend in the womb.<\/p>\n\n<p>Asexual reproduction is not unique to single-celled organisms, though. While it is prevalent (and easy) in bacteria, some multicellular organisms reproduce asexually. Some plants are capable or this via <em>self-pollination<\/em>, and there have been some reports (albeit rather dubious) of certain \"common\" animals reproducing asexually.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to asexual reproduction. One advantage is obvious: no mate necessary. As long as an organism has enough energy and nutrients to reproduce, it can. Also, the process is quick, and easy. There are some disadvantages, though. The big one is that there is no recombination from multiple DNA sources - that is, the resulting organism will have exactly (again, barring mutations) the same genes as its parent - for better or for worse. If an asexually-reproducing organism has a defect that still allows it to reproduce, chances are, its offspring will have that defect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some sources:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/biol/Microbiology/Replication.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/biol/Microbiology/Replication.htm<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/biology/asexual-reproduction-in-animals-characteristics-occurrence-and-types/11727/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/biology/asexual-reproduction-in-animals-characteristics-occurrence-and-types/11727/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~mbsffe09/talks/Krug.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~mbsffe09/talks/Krug.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":21616,"question_id":21615,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21615/can-mono-cell-or-other-organism-self-replicate","last_activity_date":1411602912,"creation_date":1411596115,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can Mono-Cell or other organism self-replicate?","body":"<p>I have a question regarding how organism replicate them self to create an other organism,<\/p>\n\n<p>We know that in animal reign, we need a male and female that will generate a new being.<\/p>\n\n<p>what I want to know is if there is a micro organism that can create another one without a partner of the same kind? and in that case how this organism can do that?<\/p>\n\n<p>hope my question was clear!<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks! <\/p>\n","question_id":21615,"tags":["cell-biology","replication"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":21616,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":182,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/556b6e52ad084fc8fbe7c1c4a917bf03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8991,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8991/frenchwhorne","reputation":173,"display_name":"frenchwhorne","accept_rate":71},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":21580,"edited":false,"creation_date":1411536992,"comment_id":34062,"body":"What do you want to see?

There are a number of things to establish before attempting comprehend FGM. Firstly, shifts in an adaptive landscape, in natural scenarios, are generally quite small. Because populations have been evolving for such a long time and the small shifts in adaptive peaks it means that most populations should be near or on a local fitness optimum within the relevant landscape. The adaptive landscape comes from S. Wright, discussed in the Orr paper, where he spoke of a field of possible gene combinations\" each with a fitness value, some combinations are fitter than others. Adaptive peaks represent the fittest combinations of all traits.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can picture all of this using a single trait:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/esnOW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here there is a local optimum (which is also global, Fisher assumed that adaptive landscapes are less rugged than Sewall Wright and had only one optimum) for the trait. The population starts at point A (the red ball), just off the adaptive peak for the initial fitness distribution (blue trace). Then selection alters (red trace), initiating a new bout of adaptation, making the population (green ball) further from the optimum. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1fNPq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>From here lets imagine this is two seperate populations, the green population (A) wants to move along the red line to the highest point, the red population (B) along the blue line also for its own optimum.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a mutation which has a very small effect arises then there is 50% probability in both populations that it will improve fitness (assuming no neutral mutation) because it will either be recessive or deleterious. This value is shown in box 2 figure 1 of the Orr paper. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7JD1j.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Now if a large effect mutation was to arise in then there is less chance of it being beneficial for population B than for population A, this is because B is closer to its phenotypic optimum so a large effect mutation is likely to \"overshoot\" the optimum. (The black line illustrates where either population would end up after a large effect mutation in the direction of the adaptive peak). You can see this mutation would put population A very close to its peak (the red line) and population B would have a reduced fitness. This is summed up nicely in the opening to the Orr paper.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Precise adaptation is possible only if organisms can come to fit their environments by many minute adjustments\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XdIyh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So, descriptively, this is why we see a reduced probability of large effect beneficial mutations as we approach an optimum; we expect most bouts of adaptation to be due to small shifts in adaptive landscape and populations to start bouts near to the former adaptive peak.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FGM expands this out beyond one trait (or, as Kauffman and Gillespie did, the sequence - with the latter seemingly being more successful than the former). As shown in figure 1 of the Orr paper,<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eUi0l.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This is a highly multidimensional space, with one dimension per trait, therefore more complex organisms by definition will have more complex spaces. The centre of this sphere is the phenotypic optimum, and each layer represents and adaptive movement, or substitution of the wild type as in the Maynard-Smith adaptive walks system. The red line shows the movement made by the population through this sphere.<\/p>\n\n<p>And now for some math. (Refer to box two in the Orr paper). $P_a (\\chi)$ is the probability that a mutation (of effect size $r$) is favourable. Thinking about what I discuss above, that is, $P_a (\\chi)$ is the probability that a mutation will increase fitness, which must therefore be a product of the landscape complexity (the number of characters affecting the fitness), the distance from the population to the optimum, and the size of the effect. $\\chi$ is the standardized mutation size, which accounts for the distance to optima, as $z$, the number of characters affecting fitness as $n$, and the effect size $r$. This means that $\\chi$ = $r \\sqrt{n} /2z$: therefore an increase in the distance to the phenotypic optimum ($z$) reduces the value of $\\chi$ (thus increasing the probability that a mutation has a beneficial effect), whereas increases in $r$ or $n$ will decrease the probability that the mutation is beneficial (i.e. large effect mutations and high complexity). In the context of the above example, both populations have an $n$ of 1, and the values of $z$ vary - this means population A can tolerate a larger value of $r$, or in other words, population A is more able to make adaptive substitutions because it is further from peak fitness, thus more tolerant to large effects, than population B.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Difference between $r$ and $\\chi$: $r$ is the raw value of effect size of a mutation, whereas $\\chi$ is the standardized effect size. Assuming equal effect sizes the relative effect of mutations will depend on the number of traits affecting fitness (see the diagrams below), thus we have to correct for this.<\/p>\n\n<p>How does complexity affect the probability of beneficial mutations? Look at the following diagram. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xtT15.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Each point represents a possible combination of traits when we have three traits affecting fitness, each with two possible incarnations (A or a [most fit and least fit respectively]). The outer green ring has one possible occupying combination (aaa) which is the least fit - it's the furthest from the optimal combination, the red point. On the green ring the probablity of increasing fitness with a mutation is 3/3 (because there are 3 possible mutations all of which increase fitness). <em>Note, assume all changes are equal effect.<\/em> If we change one trait to the A version we can have 3 possible outcomes (Aaa, aAa, aaA) which occupy the yellow ring. From the yellow ring a further single mutation has four possible outcomes, of which 3 can increase fitness so the probability of improving fitness with a mutation is reduced (3/4). In the blue ring there is a 1/4 probability of increasing fitness. Jumping to the red point, where all traits are A, every possible mutation will reduce fitness (0/3).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Grs9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Bearing this in mind, lets change n (the number of traits affecting fitness) from 3 to 4. The least fit starts in the red ring (aaaa), from here there is a 4/4 probability of increased fitness via mutation. From the green ring there is a 6/7 probability. From the yellow ring there is a 4/8 probability of increasing fitness, and from the blue a 1/7 chance.

Also what is 1-8 lanes? are they different concentration of enzymes? if so then it looks ok to me since the higher the enzyme concentration from left to right, the higher the amount of digest products you have. If the peptide sizes obtained are not the ones expected then perhaps increase or decrease the digestion time since you could have a problem due to either incomplete digest or unspecific digestion, depending.

After a quick look I found a paper which should be relevant as a starting point for you: <a href=\"http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/06-1672.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mayor et al. 2007. Spectrum of selection: new approaches to detecting the scale-dependent response to habitat. Ecology 88(7)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my mind, there are two questions here. First, to what extent will low population size in sub-optimal environments (leading to a smaller sample to work with) lead to more uncertain inferences of preferred habitat/substrate; basically saying that noise might swamp signal in sub-optimal environments. Second, to detect selection for a particular habitat/substrate, you must sample a wide enough range of environments so that you capture both preferred and unpreferred habitats and transitions between them. In the paper I linked to this issue is touched upon in the discussion:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Second, evidence of habitat selection depends on the scale of analysis. To understand scale dependence, investigations must encompass a spatial scope sufficiently wide to uncover scale domains of selection and the thresholds or transitions between them. In both cases, spatial scale is the empowering principle, and scaling continua are the means of application.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I've seen similar ideas as this show up in papers on habitat choice in birds living in agricultural landscapes as well, where some species are often found in rather poor environments (because these environments are common). Looking at habitat preferences only in these environments might then give a misleading view, since individual choices are constrained. Also relevant, even if not mentioned in your question, is the concept of <em>maladaptive habitat selection<\/em> (sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_trap\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>ecological traps<\/em><\/a>), where you can have situations where species use environmental cues that used to indicate high fitness habitats, but might now result in maladaptive choices, see e.g. <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10336-007-0226-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Pärt et al. 2007.

It is impossible for vultures (or anybody else) to get botulism from a carcass. <\/p>\n\n<p>First, you have <strong>spores<\/strong>. They are ubiquitous in nature, and you have probably eaten lots of them. They are especially common on vegetables growing around/in dirt, like garlic. The spores are <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>indestructible when using common cooking methods <\/li>\n<li>dormant under normal food storage conditions <\/li>\n<li>not dangerous to humans above 1 year of age. They remain dormant in the human body and get excreted without causing anything. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Then, you have <strong>botulinum bacteria colonies<\/strong>. To get a colony going, you need to take some spores and cut off the oxygen supply. For example, storing raw garlic in oil provides both a possible contamination route and a perfect growth environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>The bacteria themselves are \n  - easy to kill off with heat \n  - not prone to establishing a colony in your body. <\/p>\n\n<p>The problem with the bacteria: Once there has been a colony, it starts producing the toxin. This toxin is very poisonous even in minute amounts, and stays around to harm you even after you have killed the bacteria which produced it (e.g. with acid). It is not especially heat stable, certainly not as stable as the spores. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, the way you get botulism is: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start out with food contaminated by the spores (meat is rarely such food, vegetables are more common. Of course, cross contamination in your kitchen is possible.) <\/li>\n<li>Cut off all oxygen supply for some time. A colony forms. <\/li>\n<li>Sterilizing the food by placing it in boiling water for some time doesn't matter, the spores will survive it easily. (This is why industrial food is canned at much higher temperatures, and safe home canning recipes are quite acidic). <\/li>\n<li>eat the food after it has been stored with the colony inside. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So, vultures don't have any special resistance to botulism toxin, they just don't come in contact with it. <\/p>\n\n<p>On a side note, there are quite a few other pathogens which are common in meat, and vultures are probably more resistant to them than humans. But it is normal for bacteria to be able to only make one species, or a small range of species sick. Just ask the poor medical researchers trying to heal human disease in mouse models - there are huge differences. <\/p>\n","answer_id":21567,"question_id":21513,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21513/why-does-botulinum-toxin-seem-to-be-more-dangerous-to-humans-than-to-other-mamma","last_activity_date":1411468711,"creation_date":1411313946,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why does botulinum toxin seem to be more dangerous to humans than to other mammals?","body":"<p>Various mammals seem to get away with <strong>eating parts of carcasses<\/strong> that we would prefer to <strong>not even touch<\/strong>, and that we assume will make us sick.<br>\nBecause of that, I assume botulinum toxin is more dangerous to humans than many animals.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is that right so far - can they <strong>handle more<\/strong> of some toxins compared to us?<br>\nOr are they <strong>better in avoiding<\/strong> harmful substances based on more suited olfactory sense?<br>\nOr are we just <strong>more afraid<\/strong>?<\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming the differences exist - what is the cause for it?<br>\nAre there plausible explanations in terms of evolutionary pressure?<\/p>\n","question_id":21513,"tags":["evolution","bacteriology","mammals","medicine","bacterial-toxins"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":249,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1411321225},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5947b6f2df00b28a4fdb343be58d0723?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9438,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9438/jonathan-mee","reputation":109,"display_name":"Jonathan Mee"},"closed_date":1411467612,"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b771a341bd46dde26aac28aae1881ee9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4025,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4025/jan","reputation":459,"display_name":"Jan"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1411456410,"creation_date":1411417116,"body":"<p>By shin splints you probably mean the pain on the inner front side of the lower 2/3 parts of the shins?

The human generation time can be tricky to estimate, but 20 years is often used. However, the average number is likely to be higher. Research has shown that the great apes (chimps, gorilla, orangutan) have generation times comparatble to humans, in the range of 18-29 years (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15716\">Langergraber et al. 2012<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Using 7 million years and 20 years yields an estimated <strong>350000 ancestral generations<\/strong> for each living human. A more conservative estimate, using an average generation time of 28, would result in 250000 generations. However, some have argued that the human-chimp split is closer to 13 million years old, which would mean that approximately 650000 generations have passed (using a generation time of 20 years). <\/p>\n\n<p>The exact number of ancestral generations for each human will naturally differ a bit, and some populations might have higher or lower numbers on average due to chance events or historical reasons (colonizations patterns etc). However, due to the law of large numbers my guess would be that discrepancies are likely to have averaged out. In any case, the current estimates of the human-chimp split and average historical generation times are so uncertain, so that they will swamp any other effects when trying to calculate the number of ancestoral generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, this is only answering the number of ancestral generations. The <strong>number of ancestors in your full pedigree<\/strong> is something completely different. Since every ancestor has 2 parents, the number of ancestors will grow exponentially. Theoretically, the full pedigree of ancestors can be calculated using:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$N_\\text{ancestors} = \\sum_{i=1}^t 2^i \\hspace{1em} \\text{or} \\hspace{1em} 2^{t+1}-2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where t is the number of generations. However, this will yield an unreasonably large number of ancestors (~$2.3*10^{105}$ over just 350 generations), since it assumes that all of your ancestors are unrelated. Basically, you run into something called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse\">pedigree collapse<\/a>, which means that your pedigree will have many overlaps (due to inbreeding, overlapping generations etc), so all of your ancestors cannot be seen as unrelated. In practice, this means that the number of ancestors in successive generations will stop doubling for each generation you go back, and will eventually start shrinking, which will drastically reduce the number of unique ancestors. For more on this, see answers to the question <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16147/initial-population-when-i-count-backwards/16160#16160\">Initial population when i count backwards?<\/a>. That question is basically asking about the same issue, but less specifically. There might be studies that have tried to calculate the average number of ancestors to living humans, but I haven't seen any. Therefore, I cannot say anything more specific about the average number of unique ancestors for a living human individual.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21536,"question_id":21533,"up_vote_count":19,"last_edit_date":1411387418},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550973bfc1f6c08ff29efee9a1cc7fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":2938,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/2938/jack-aidley","reputation":3478,"display_name":"Jack Aidley"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNsbT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9441,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9441/philip-kendall","reputation":101,"display_name":"Philip Kendall"},"score":2,"post_id":21538,"edited":false,"creation_date":1411388437,"comment_id":33939,"body":"Could you find a better source than a book on the first 20 months of babies&#39; lives?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550973bfc1f6c08ff29efee9a1cc7fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":2938,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/2938/jack-aidley","reputation":3478,"display_name":"Jack Aidley"},"score":0,"post_id":21538,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNsbT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9441,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9441/philip-kendall","reputation":101,"display_name":"Philip Kendall"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1411389099,"comment_id":33941,"body":"Apparently I fail at cut-and-paste, corrected."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f5dbe13a9378646da1e8fc87fd05316?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8821,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8821/joe","reputation":128,"display_name":"Joe"},"score":3,"post_id":21538,"edited":false,"creation_date":1411408274,"comment_id":33970,"body":"Are you claiming that two people from the native populations of Australia and South America share a common ancestor 3500 years ago?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50ccdbac5f0f9ff683e4b30a248189bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6815,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6815/mooing-duck","reputation":101,"display_name":"Mooing Duck"},"score":1,"post_id":21538,"edited":false,"creation_date":1411408548,"comment_id":33972,"body":"@JackAidley: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor<\/a> &quot;the human MRCA may have lived 2,000 to 4,000 years ago.

The key points are that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma\" rel=\"nofollow\">stoma<\/a> (leaf surface pores) are so small that the menisci can withstand huge water columns, that water has strong cohesive forces, and that water is transported using the negative pressure that is created by transpiration. The webpage linked above contains a beautiful visualization of how multitudes of stomata and menisci create strong negative pressures:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ppmkU.png\" alt=\"Water transport in trees, from www.science4all.org/le-nguyen-hoang/the-amazing-physics-of-water-in-trees\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Second, much of the current discussion in the comments (an indication that the question might be a poor fit for Bio-SE?) revolves around the plausibility of the cohesion-tension theory, and specifically on whether water can sustain strong negative pressures. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631070506002283\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Caupin &amp; Herbert. 2006.

The paper references a large number of experiments under various experimental setups (I cannot fairly judge these). In their conclusion they state that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Among the countless cavitation experiments, only the ones with special care about water purity can reach large negative pressures; with a variety of techniques, they all obtain Pcav around −25 MPa at room temperature (see Fig. 3 (b)), which falls far away from the theoretical value (from −120 to −140 MPa). There is a notable exception: experiments with mineral inclusions achieve −140 MPa. The large gap between these data requires special attention.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically, the theoretical estimates lie at -130MPa and empirical results at -25MPa (-250 atmospheres), and water can clearly achieve large negative pressures. This would also mean that the current estimates are much larger than what is needed for the cohesion-tension theory to work (atmospheric pressure= 0.1MPa, negative pressure in water column at 50m ~ -0.5MPa).<\/p>\n\n<p>They also have a section specifically discussing trees:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>7.1. Water in nature<br>\n  The law of hydrostatics teaches us that the pressure drop in a water column of 10.2 m is 0.1 MPa. This points out that negative pressures can be reached in the ascending sap of tall trees. In fact additional effects (viscous flow, drought) make the pressure in the sap negative even at smaller heights. The cohesion-tension theory, first proposed by Dixon and Jolly [56], explains that the sap column is held at the top by the meniscus in the pore of the leaves: by Laplace\u2019s law, the meniscus curvature allows a pressure jump between the outside air pressure and the negative pressure in the sap. The trees thus contain large amounts of metastable liquids. Cavitation may sometimes occur, disrupting the liquid column and stopping the flow (xylem emboly). The complex hydraulic architecture of trees limits the damage, and strategies exist to refill the embolied xylem channels. Much work has been devoted to this topic, and is reviewed in Refs. [110,111].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is also evidence that the risk of xylem embolism increases with tree height, and this creates a trade-off between water transport efficiency and structural adaptations to deal with embolism (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/33/12069\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Domec et al. 2008. Maximum height in a conifer is associated with conflicting requirements for xylem design. PNAS 105(33).\">Domec et al. 2008<\/a>). This is for instance facilitated by the pit aperture diameter of tracheids, with apertures decreasing with height along a tree, causing increased resistance to embolism but at the same time lower water conductance. This will clearly limit the height of trees, and the paper indicates that the tallest Douglas firs are at the edge of what they can achieve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another recently published paper that should be relevant is '<em>Methods for measuring plant vulnerability to cavitation: a critical review<\/em>' by <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/24/jxb.ert193.full\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Cochard et al. 2013. Methods for measuring plant vulnerability to cavitation: a critical review. Journal of Experimental Botany\">Cochard et al. (2013)<\/a>, but I haven't had time to look closely at this. See abstract below:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Abstract:<\/strong><br>\n  Xylem cavitation resistance has profound implications for plant physiology and ecology. This process is characterized by a \u2018vulnerability curve\u2019 (VC) showing the variation of the percentage of cavitation as a function of xylem pressure potential. The shape of this VC varies from \u2018sigmoidal\u2019 to \u2018exponential\u2019. This review provides a panorama of the techniques that have been used to generate such a curve. The techniques differ by (i) the way cavitation is induced (e.g. bench dehydration, centrifugation, or air injection), and (ii) the way cavitation is measured (e.g. percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) or acoustic emission), and a nomenclature is proposed based on these two methods. A survey of the literature of more than 1200 VCs was used to draw statistics on the usage of these methods and on their reliability and validity. Four methods accounted for more than 96% of all curves produced so far: bench dehydration\u2013PLC, centrifugation\u2013PLC, pressure sleeve-PLC, and Cavitron. How the shape of VCs varies across techniques and species xylem anatomy was also analysed. Strikingly, it was found that the vast majority of curves obtained with the reference bench dehydration-PLC method are \u2018sigmoidal\u2019. \u2018Exponential\u2019 curves were more typical of the three other methods and were remarkably frequent for species having large xylem conduits (ring-porous), leading to a substantial overestimation of the vulnerability of cavitation for this functional group. We suspect that \u2018exponential\u2019 curves may reflect an open-vessel artefact and call for more precautions with the usage of the pressure sleeve and centrifugation techniques. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":11068,"question_id":11044,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1411388982},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ecb2130d870caa97f33b9e9e658e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4109,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4109/resonating","reputation":3125,"display_name":"Resonating"},"score":0,"post_id":11083,"edited":false,"creation_date":1403623892,"comment_id":27423,"body":"Now that&#39;s an interesting one.

IMPLICATION FOR WATER TRANSPORT TO THE TOPS OF TALL TREES\n  Most plant physiologists accept the \u201ccohesion-tension theory\u201d as the explanation for the ascent of sap.26 In this qualitative theory, the move of water depends upon three important physical-chemical properties of water, which actually corre- spond to capillary rise (cohesion), cavitation (tension), and the hydrated wall (low contact angle), respectively. In this section, we focus only on the implication of the general force balance and loop hysteresis in the capillary rise of a tall tree. The height to which water in a tree rises is dependent on the size of the transport conduits. If one cuts down a tree and looks inside, the capillary dimensions of the relatively large conduits (the xylem tube) are on the order of 100 μm.27 As a result, the capillary rise is about 0.1 m. If capillary pressure alone were to explain the water rise to the treetop of a 100 m tall tree, such as the coastal redwoods of California, a capillary radius of about 100 nm is required. It was suggested that the relevant capillary dimension is the air−water interfaces in the cell walls of the uppermost leaves. The matrix of cellulose microfibrils is highly wettable, and the spacing among them yields effective pore diameters of about 10 nm. It has been pointed out that it is not necessary for the capillary to have a small bore throughout its length. Only the bore at the meniscus (i.e., in the uppermost leaf) is relevant.27 This consequence has been proved in our general expression of force balance, eq 4. Note that a microchannel containing corners or cusps on its cross section is not considered in the derivation of eq 4. Liquid filaments extend to infinity in the corners or cusps.28 Nonetheless, the elevation of the liquid column is still inversely proportional to the characteristic dimension of the cross section of the tube. For the solutions satisfying the force balance, nevertheless, there exists the issue of physical stability.\n  A small bore at the uppermost leaf connected to a larger xylem conduit reveals the presence of a convergent micro- channel. As a consequence, multiple stable heights are possible, as described in the aforementioned analyses. However, the final state depends on the initial condition. The liquid will rise to a stable height corresponding to the larger xylem conduit if the microchannel is initially empty. In other words, the liquid will not rise of its own accord to the stable height near the top of the convergent channel because it will not be able to traverse the larger conduit of the channel. This situation is, nonetheless, stable if the liquid is sucked up to the top and then the suction is removed. How does a tall tree acquire such large negative (suction) pressures from above? As demonstrated in our experiments, the gradual rise of an initially immersed cone is able to maintain the stability of the meniscus on the top of the truncated cone as long as the force balance is satisfied. Note that the contact angle in the vicinity of the small pore mouth can be tuned up to fulfill the force balance when the microchannel is not high enough. The slow growth of the tree can be regarded as a gradual rise of the convergent channel. As long as water transport to the pores on the uppermost leaves is not interrupted throughout the entire course of the tree\u2019s growth to 100 m, this stable height can be achieved without resorting to suction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":11083,"question_id":11044,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1fd2f4d84599dde8f3d69266e0aba619?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5363,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5363/asaga","reputation":21,"display_name":"Asaga"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"post_id":14344,"edited":false,"creation_date":1390565506,"comment_id":19426,"body":"The same text has also been published in <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/24/28/284110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Journal of Physics: Condensed matter<\/a>."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1389216670,"creation_date":1389216670,"body":"<p>The following paper surveyed work on exploring water at negative pressure, from the first attempt a hundred years ago, when the largest tension reached was -3.4 MPa @ 24 degC, till the most recent measurement of water at room temperature down to -26 MPa:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/72/64/37/PDF/Caupin-JPCondensedMatter-2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/72/64/37/PDF/Caupin-JPCondensedMatter-2012.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore trees can lift water higher than 10 meters because water is pulled up by negative pressure at the top (Cohesion-tension theory CTT).

One program used is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq-OIGKzdLk\" rel=\"nofollow\">WingMachine<\/a> - though the <a href=\"http://bio.fsu.edu/~dhoule/Welcome2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to the software seems to be broken<\/a> - which can measure morphology aspects of a fly wing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Something I'd like to be able to do is put a vial of food under a scope and have it quickly count the number of eggs on the surface of the food. <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7927/software-for-counting-fly-eggs\">I asked a question about it a while back<\/a>.. This would be very useful, many labs have to count eggs (to make the number of eggs constant in each vial, variation here can have serious effects on the adult fly so control is important in ecology studies) and it is a slow, difficult and highly inaccurate, particularly variable between people. If there was some way of putting the vial under the scope, hitting a button and getting an approximation of the number it would be great!<\/p>\n\n<p>A colleague counts dead beetles at the moment, I'm sure he'd appreciate a similar kind of program where he could image and have the software count automatically. I think both of these problems would be easy to solve with very similar software. Making software that is easy to \"teach\" how to recognize individuals is the key.<\/p>\n\n<p>A slightly more complex bit of machine learning might be getting it to count different phenotypes in one image. Fitness assays in flies often use a wild type fly with dark bodied (ebony) competitors, the body of the wild type is comparatively more yellow. The fitness of the focal wild type fly is then the number of wild type offspring among the total (the dark body phenotype is recessive, therefore when the focal wild type mates with an ebony it produces wild type flies, if two ebonies mate we get a dark body offspring). Here the machine would have to be able to tell the difference and count both.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I'll attach a proper picture from under the scope later, the picture in my previous question was taken with a digital camera, not via a scope but it gives an idea of what it looks like.<\/em><\/p>\n","answer_id":21434,"question_id":20321,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1411026900},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user560"},"score":0,"post_id":21496,"edited":false,"creation_date":1411222728,"comment_id":33824,"body":"Look into WEKA segmentation algorithms implemented in FIJI/ImageJ."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1411210436,"creation_date":1411209609,"body":"<p>One of my colleagues does lots of histological work, staining and identifying tissue at the microscopic level.

They found that synaptogenesis occurs synchronously across cortical areas, with a peak of synapse density during the juvenile period (3\u20135 y). Moreover, similar to findings in humans, dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal neurons developed later than sensorimotor areas.
