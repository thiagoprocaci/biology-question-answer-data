Even the popular low carb diets of the late 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_diet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atkins Diet<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Beach_Diet\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Beach Diet<\/a>) were just that, they were <strong>Low Carb, Not No Carb<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>We know there are <strong>essential dietary nutrients<\/strong> for humans, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">essential fatty acids<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">essential amino acids<\/a>. The reason that these <strong>must<\/strong> be obtained in the diet is because humans do not have the enzymes to synthesize these nutrients <em>de novo<\/em> (aka, \"From Scratch\").<\/p>\n\n<p>From a biochemical perspective we know that fatty acids and acetyl-CoA <strong>cannot<\/strong> be converted back into glucose or other carbohydrate intermediates. This is because of the <strong>irreversible<\/strong> biochemical reaction catalyzed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_dehydrogenase\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyruvate dehydrogenase<\/a>, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Thus, fatty acids (lipids) can be oxidized to acetyl-CoA (for the TCA/Krebs Cycle) but cannot be further converted to glucose within the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of protein, however, amino acids are either glucogenic, ketogenic, or both. If amino acids are ketogenic, then this means they can be converted into acetyl-CoA for the Krebs Cycle. If amino acids are glucogenic, then it means that they can be broken down into glucose. The breakdown of amino acids can be used to synthesize glucose or for anapleurotic reactions of the Krebs Cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>As stated in the <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/5/951.2.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">editorial noted in the comments<\/a> of this question (From the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition), there are daily \"requirements\" for carbohydrates.

It's important to know how researchers arrive at those specific numbers.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>First, we measure the 'absolute threshold of hearing' across the entire audio range for a group of listeners. This gives us a curve representing the very quietest sound the human ear can perceive for any given frequency as measured in ideal circumstances on healthy ears. Anechoic surroundings, precision calibrated playback equipment, and rigorous statistical analysis are the easy part. Ears and auditory concentration both fatigue quickly, so testing must be done when a listener is fresh. That means lots of breaks and pauses. Testing takes anywhere from many hours to many days depending on the methodology.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Then we collect data for the opposite extreme, the 'threshold of pain'. This is the point where the audio amplitude is so high that the ear's physical and neural hardware is not only completely overwhelmed by the input, but experiences physical pain. Collecting this data is trickier. You don't want to permanently damage anyone's hearing in the process.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The upper limit of the human audio range is defined to be where the absolute threshold of hearing curve crosses the threshold of pain. To even faintly perceive the audio at that point (or beyond), it must simultaneously be unbearably loud.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>At low frequencies, the cochlea works like a bass reflex cabinet. The helicotrema is an opening at the apex of the basilar membrane that acts as a port tuned to somewhere between 40Hz to 65Hz depending on the individual. Response rolls off steeply below this frequency.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, 20Hz - 20kHz is a generous range. It thoroughly covers the audible spectrum, an assertion backed by nearly a century of experimental data.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PuhtK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Above: Approximate equal loudness curves derived from Fletcher and Munson (1933) plus modern sources for frequencies > 16kHz. The absolute threshold of hearing and threshold of pain curves are marked in red. Subsequent researchers refined these readings, culminating in the Phon scale and the ISO 226 standard equal loudness curves. Modern data indicates that the ear is significantly less sensitive to low frequencies than Fletcher and Munson's results.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This seems to imply that it's highly, highly improbable that anything above 20 kHz could be heard by the human ear, and that in most realistic conditions even that threshold would never be reached.

Unlike humans, the increased pressure from constipation does not come from straining to get the excrements out, but from the impaction of the excrements within the horse and the resultant pressure that causes.  This in turn leads to expansion of the blood vessels around the anus and this may cause hemorrhoids and eventually bleeding.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In <em>cats<\/em><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the main reasons behind the occurrence of cat hemorrhoids is heredity, which plays a major role in deciding who would and who would not get afflicted with this condition.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Diets low in fiber and liquid content are the main cause of constipation, which in turn leads to excess pressure being applied during defecation and straining when bowels are passed. Too much pressure in the rectum and lower abdomen causes blood vessels in this region to expand, thus leading to the creation of lumps called hemorrhoids.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There have also been some <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16981041\">investigations<\/a> in which haemorrhoids were induced by ligation of the inferior haemorrhoidal vein into apes.

There are a couple of places in the body where this occurs, including the liver (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">hepatic portal system<\/a>) and the pituitary (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophyseal_portal_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">hypophyseal portal system<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question... yes, the hepatic portal circulation drains into the liver sinusoids, which is one large capillary circulation.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The hepatic arteries and portal vein give off branches that make up the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_triad\" rel=\"nofollow\">portal triad<\/a><\/strong> which delivers blood (<em>both arterial and venous blood<\/em>) to the functional units of the liver which are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobules_of_liver\" rel=\"nofollow\">hepatic lobules<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hepatic portal system drains into the liver and forms a highly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenestra_(histology)\" rel=\"nofollow\">fenestrated<\/a> network of capillary beds within the liver <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma\" rel=\"nofollow\">parenchyma<\/a>. In the case of the hepatic portal circulation, the flow through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_sinusoid\" rel=\"nofollow\">liver sinusoids<\/a> is considered this capillary bed. In humans, the flow of blood that makes up the hepatic portal circulation is mostly venous blood from the gastrointestinal tract.  This allows blood to flow through the liver for clearance of substances like drugs and hormones before those substances reach the peripheral circulation. Specifically, arterial blood flows to the majority of the stomach, small intestine and colon from the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. This arterial blood flows through the capillary beds in the mesenteric circulation (i.e. the capillary beds around the intestinal enterocytes) and then into the major veins that drain the intestinal tract. There are two major veins that drain the intestinal tract, the superior and inferior mesenteric veins. The inferior mesenteric vein drains into the splenic vein and then the splenic vein and superior mesenteric veins merge to form the portal vein of the liver. Once blood flows into the portal vein it flows through the hepatic sinusoids (another capillary bed) before flowing out of the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava, and then back into the heart.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The figure below is a picture of the intestinal veins from <strong>Gray's Anatomy<\/strong>  (wikipedia) that form the hepatic portal vein, the superior and inferior mesenteric as well as the splenic vein. In the figure the older term <em>lienal vein<\/em> is used instead of <em>splenic vein<\/em>.

Or are omnivores merely herbivores who are less picky?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>On second thought, I'll tackle those questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"border\" between herbivores and omnivores is very fuzzy among mammals, birds and at least some reptiles. Amphibians are a treat - they're all carnivores. Among reptiles, snakes are exclusively carnivorous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most lizards are also carnivores, though there are some herbivores. I'm not even sure about omnivorous lizards, though.<\/p>\n\n<p>Omnivores are all over the map. If some are described as herbivores that are less picky, others could be described as carnivores that are less picky.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that certain species can be herbivores, carnivores or omnivores in certain parts of their range or during certain seasons. For example, bears may feast on salmon or ungulate calves when they're available but spend most of their time foraging for plants and small animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most familiar omnivores include humans, pigs, raccoons and (some) rats, so you might look for some similarities between these species. Humans and raccoons are plantigrade, for example (as are bears - and rats, too, I believe). Humans, pigs and rats are known for their intelligence. Pigs and rats are very popular in medical research, for some interesting reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to note is species that defy their group's general dietary tendencies. For example, the giant panda and palm nut vulture are herbivores, whereas other vultures are carnivores and most bears are omnivores - except for the polar bear.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's another general rule; omnivores may be more rare in habitats that are lacking in plants. I don't think any marine mammals are considered omnivores, for example. All cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are carnivores, as is the sea otter. However, sirenians (manatees, dugong, etc.) are all herbivores.<\/p>\n\n<p>That might give you something to work with.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong> To my surprise, there are some good resources comparing omnivores and carnivores. Check out <a href=\"http://www.vegsource.com/news/2009/11/the-comparative-anatomy-of-eating.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Comparative Anatomy of Eating<\/a>. The source might look a little flaky, but it looks very accurate to me. (It uses some of the same examples I did. ;))<\/p>\n\n<p>To my surprise, there is apparently a closer correlation between carnivores-omnivores than herbivores-omnivores. But bear in mind that this article apparently focuses on mammals. Thus, differences in jaws and teeth can hardly be applied to birds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding my comment on omnivore intelligence, see <a href=\"http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-4a.shtml#part%204\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence, Evolution of the Human Brain and Diet<\/a>, though I can't vouch for its accuracy. Intelligence can be related to diet; it takes more brainpower to capture active prey than sneak up on a clump of grass, for example. This would suggest a preponderance of \"intelligent\" organisms among carnivores.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intelligence can also be related to anatomical differences, like bipedalism, opposable thumbs and binocular vision.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, most of the animals that are renowned for their intelligence appear to be carnivores or omnivores. Exceptions include gorillas, orangs, gibbons and the giant panda.<\/p>\n\n<p>While whales, wolves/dogs, squids and octopuses are carnivores. Crows and ravens - regarded as among the most intelligent birds - are omnivores, as are humans, chimpanzees, pigs and at least some rats. As far as I know, pigs are generally regarded as the most intelligent ungulates (hoofed mammals); they're also among the few that are omnivores. (I can't think of any other omnivorous ungulates offhand.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Pigs are also more compact than other ungulates, with stocky bodies and short legs. In fact, there don't appear to be many long-legged omnivores (among mammals, at least). Similarly, most (if not all) long-legged birds are carnivores (or insectivores, vermivores, etc.).<\/p>\n","answer_id":43773,"question_id":43746,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1456718327}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43746/anatomical-differences-between-herbivores-and-omnivores","last_activity_date":1456833207,"creation_date":1456567910,"answer_count":1,"title":"Anatomical differences between herbivores and omnivores","body":"<p>What are differences of herbivores vs omnivores?

Glucagon travels through the blood and acts predominately in the liver on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">glucagon receptors<\/a>. The glucagon peptide binds to the glucagon receptor on the OUTSIDE of the cell and transmits a signal to the INSIDE of the cell. This occurs when the glucagon binds to the receptor, changing its conformation or \"shape\" on the inside of the cell, which then causes binding and activation of a G-protein inside the cell ($G_S$). This $G_S$ protein activates an enzyme within the cell (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase\" rel=\"nofollow\">adenylyl cyclase<\/a>) to increase the concentration of a substance called cyclic AMP (aka <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate\" rel=\"nofollow\">cAMP<\/a>) that activates a number of enzymes that ultimately increase the amount of glucose released by the liver. These effects are IMMEDIATE effects, which is why we sometimes give glucagon injections to treat patients with hypoglycemia (i.e. dangerously low blood sugar concentration). However, sustained glucagon signaling likely has effects on the expression of the enzymes that cause the glucose to be released from the liver as well (though that is a discussion for another question). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/L1gV6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/L1gV6.png\" alt=\"Cortisol\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cortisol<\/a>, pictured above, is a steroid hormone (i.e. LIPID) that is released from the adrenal glands, specifically the <em>zona fasciulata<\/em>, which is the middle of the three 'layers' of the adrenal gland. Cortisol is referred to as a <em>glucocorticoid<\/em> and exerts its major effects through changing gene transcription in a variety of cell types. The way that cortisol does this is by binding its cortisol receptor, which is generally thought to be in the cytoplasm inside the cell. Upon binding of cortisol to the cortisol receptor, that complex is then transported into the nucleus of the cell where it binds DNA and can increase or decrease the transcription or expression of target genes. In the case of cortisol, these genes are for the enzymes that increase glucose production of the liver, and thus increase the body's capacity to maintain or elevate blood glucose. There is also some evidence that cortisol has additional effects independent of gene transcription, but that is outside the scope of this question. Regardless, the effects of cortisol on glucose metabolism are not immediate, but rather they take >30 minutes to several hours to begin to take effect. <\/p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the question, both glucagon and cortisol affect glucose metabolism. Cortisol also affects the transcription of a number of genes involved in adipose tissue and lipid metabolism, as well as genes that are involved in protein metabolism and inflammation. Cortisol can be injected into a patient with an autoimmune \"flare-up\" in order to quell the inflammation, but those are different mechanisms of cortisol than its effects on glucose metabolism. A description of those effects is also outside the scope of this question, but could easily be read about in recent reviews on cortisol available on PubMed, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26241028\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recent Cortisol and Fatty Liver Review<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40971,"question_id":38920,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1456787477}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38920/what-are-the-differences-between-how-glucagon-and-cortisol-work-to-increase-bloo","last_activity_date":1456787477,"creation_date":1442691478,"answer_count":2,"title":"What are the differences between how glucagon and cortisol work to increase blood sugar?","body":"<p>As I understand, both cortisol and glucagon cause an increase in blood sugar concentrations.

I found quite the contrary result, in that randomization did far poorer than straight maximization of codon usage.  I chucked this up to working within the context of viral infection (though it was also true in transient expression from plasmid transfection under CMV promotion).<\/p>\n\n<p>I was quite excited by Pechmann and Frydman's <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2466%20M3\">Nature article<\/a> which highlighted the importance of the location of the codon within the protein when regarding optimal vs suboptimal codon selection. Oddly enough we were able to deploy this information most successfully with the purposeful deoptimization of a protein.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Pairing a locational awareness, screening for secondary structure, and then maximizing codon optimization has had the best results for more than a year.

Instead of maximizing codon optimization, they propose a \"balanced\" codon optimization that matches the normal distribution of codons in the target organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the codon bias for alanine in humans breaks down (roughly) as follows:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>GCC 65% <\/li>\n<li>GCT 20% <\/li>\n<li>GCA 11% <\/li>\n<li>GCG 4%<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>As opposed to a maximization strategy which would seek to use \"GCC\" when ever possible and only when there was an issue switch to \"GCT,\" the balanced stratgy would seek to replicate the above distribution as closely as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Has anyone tried a balanced codon approach, especially when compared to a maximization technique?<\/strong>  My overall goal is to maximize expression of naturally poorly expressing protein.  I know that straight maximization can occasionally lead to poor expression for a variety of reasons (often fatal secondary structure), but this seems like it would hardly increase expression at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would be further interested if anyone else had experience within a viral context.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know that there have been a few <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1152/which-is-more-important-for-protein-expression-mrna-structure-or-codon-optimizat\">related questions<\/a>, mostly in the context of <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/836/dna-synthesis-companies-cost-per-base-turn-around-time-codon-optimization-alg/876#876\">E.

The long DNA strands may be broken into long pieces, but overall the DNA holds up very well to heat.

Generally, laughter isn't perceived as a problem and is relatively seldom investigated. Notably there is a symptom called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pseudobulbar affect<\/a>. It describes someone that laughs (or cries) uncontrollably.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Analysing humour is like dissecting a frog; few people are interested, and the frog dies of it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>-<em>Elwyn Brooks White<\/em> <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/E._B._White\" rel=\"nofollow\">1941<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h1>Why do <em>we<\/em> (as humans) laugh?<\/h1>\n\n<p>The consensus in the community of researchers seems to be that <strong>we laugh because it strengthens human social connections<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077386/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/big-mystery-why-do-we-laugh/#.VhzjxaLOC1I\" rel=\"nofollow\">Counter-intuitively, <strong>it's not always because we find things funny<\/strong><\/a>. The linked article implies that although it's not exactly clear why we laugh, laughter is a form of seemingly non-deliberate social interaction that doesn't interrupt or replace speech, but adds to it. We laugh <em>in addition to<\/em> talking.<\/p>\n\n<h1>The evolution of laughter.<\/h1>\n\n<p>As you mention in your question, even babies laugh. Laughter is clearly not unique to humans, let alone human adults. Most social mammals laugh and there are lots of studies on ape laughter and a niche field in \"rat tickling\" which studies laughter in rats. <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/09/tickling-rats-for-science/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jaak Panksepp even found that rats can be bred that love to be tickled!<\/a> That article also discusses the science surrounding laughter and the links laughter has with increasing neurogenesis. This implies that laughter emerged a long time ago even on an evolutionary timescale and contributes in a very real way to the wiring of our brain. It's not clear <em>why<\/em> this happens. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is a popular, but unfounded, theory put forward by the philosopher John Morreall that laughter originated as some sort of group \"the danger is over\" signal after the flight or fight response. <\/p>\n\n<h1>Going back a step; <em>what<\/em> is laughter?<\/h1>\n\n<p>To fully place laughter in the context of our social constructs, we must first understand what laughter is. Unanimously, all types of laughter are non-verbal expressions of emotion (and above there is a reference to how laughter fits in <em>around<\/em> language, enriching it). These positive non-verbal auditory signals have been shown in primates to be involved with <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/50/13067.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>mirroring the emotions of others<\/strong><\/a>. At a higher level, there are <a href=\"http://ideas.ted.com/how-scientists-make-people-laugh-to-study-humor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">different types of laughter<\/a> in our social world ranging from Schadenfreude to laughter based off of specialist interest, all of which seemingly have different triggers, varying numbers of potential participents, and social purposes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another question is raised as people can interpret the authenticity of laughter. <a href=\"http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/1/246.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">This study<\/a> found that people can very easily perceive an inauthentic \"polite tittering\" from an \"explosion of mirth\". This highlights that why-ever we laugh, <strong>laughter has a complex and under-appreciated social underpinning in humans<\/strong> that we don't yet understand.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Personal views<\/h3>\n\n<p>To me at least, laughter may be the result of primitive non-verbal emotional communication and lie-detection; part of the intra-species evolutionary arms race of big brained social mammals in terms of altruism and lying. For example: I would laugh, whilst gauging the state of you by seeing if you laugh too, and then I can act on how I think you feel; be it altruistically or selfishly. You would need to be able to tell if my original laugh was testing you, or genuine. <\/p>\n\n<p>With that tool as a basic premise, one can imagine how such a wide variety of functions arose from a simple two-party status check.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n","answer_id":39540,"question_id":39539,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1456721360},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c345be66512ee14f08acd1e27e387c4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1578,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1578/rumtscho","reputation":1534,"display_name":"rumtscho","accept_rate":70},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c433aa24e1afeef1045647e454e69c2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19350,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19350/small-legend","reputation":196,"display_name":"Small Legend"},"score":0,"post_id":39580,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444841066,"comment_id":66365,"body":"Truly insightful, never thought of it like that.

But I find Hurley and Dennett's theory very convincing. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our brains are engaged full time in real-time (risky) heuristic search, generating presumtpions about what will be experienced next in every domain. This time-pressured, unsupervised generation process has necessarily lenient standards and introduces content - not all of which can be properly checked for truth - into our mental spaces. If left unexamined, the inevitable errors in these vestibules of consciousness would ultimately continue on to contaminate our world knowledge store. So there has to be a policy of double-checking these candidate beliefs and surmisings, and the discovery and resolution of these at breakneck speed is maintained by a powerful reward system - the feeling of humor; mirth - that must support this activity in competition with all the other things you could be thinking about. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I realize that the writing style is dense, and the quote requires some knowledge of their assumptions, so here is an explanation. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Pre-pre-explanation: What is a mental space?<\/h3>\n\n<p>A mental space is one of the modern assumptions of how humans organise the knowledge in their heads. I won't spend time explaining how it differs from other assumptions such as scripts. It is probably best introduced by thinking of fiction. When you watch Star Trek, you can easily think within the \"Star Trek universe\". You know that within this world, it is possible to beam up people, that money doesn't matter but dilithium crystals do, and so on. Your head holds a description of this world, and you can do logical reasoning to infer things which are true within this world. <\/p>\n\n<p>A mental space is such a \"world\" within our head. It is rarely as elaborate as the Star Trek world. It is just a compartmentalization of our knowledge of our surrounding world, such that we can hold contradicting views of the world at the same time. This is useful, for example, when we consider whether we should hurry up for work: we can conjure up a mental space representing our day if we arrive at work on time, then a contradicting one where we arrive late, and compare them. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Pre-explanation: Why we find things funny?<\/h3>\n\n<p>Our heads are constantly carrying around innumerable mental spaces, some we actively think about, others buried in memory. And all the time, we are learning new information, which may or may not be true. It is in our best interest to incorporate true information into appropriate mental models (a mental model is a complex of theories which explain to us how something works), and discard false information. For example, when a Star Trek episode introduces the Tribbles species, we have to incorporate the information that Tribbles exist as true in our \"Star Trek canon\" mental space and possibly our \"What I'd do if I were a Starfleet officer\" mental space, and keep it as false in all other mental spaces. <\/p>\n\n<p>What Hurley and Dennett are proposing is that our brains know how to evaluate information for truth value (or at least consistency with a mental model). This job is, like most jobs in the brain, too computing intensive for the conscious mind. But when it gets done, the conscious mind has to be informed about the computation result. This information arrives, as with all other conclusions of the unconscious computation, in the form of a feeling - in this case, the feeling of mirth. So, if you find something funny, it is a sign that the mental space you just built (which contains this \"something\") is incongruous and should be abandoned as untrue. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Explanation: Why we laugh?<\/h3>\n\n<p>We are social animals. It will frequently happen that we are all receiving the same new information from outside as our herd comrades. And out in the jungle, we frequently evaluate new information as being a possible danger. Is this rumbling a tiger? When a herd member has computed the signal and his sense of mirth has told him that the \"this is dangerous\" mental space is internally inconsistent, the automatically triggered laughter will inform other herd members that the situation is safe and they can relax. This is what makes laughter contagious and pleasant (although they have additional arguments for \"pleasant\" - basically, a reward without which we wouldn't be inclined to go through the resource-hungry heuristic computations). <\/p>\n\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We feel something is funny when we consider a proposition which turns out to be untrue, \n\n<ul>\n<li>especially also when we consider a potential danger and it turns out that we are safe. <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>We laugh when something is funny as a signal to others that \"things are not what they seem to be\", \n\n<ul>\n<li>especially that a danger we may all be evaluating is not dangerous. <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Arguments for the above theory<\/h3>\n\n<p>I only had the space here to present the content of the theory. For the arguments why they believe this theory to hold, and how it compares to multiple competing theories, please see their book. It is a truly fascinating read.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Hurley, M.

He has even written several books on the topic. His theory is that laughter was a primitve form of communication that evolved. For example,he and some graduate students listened in on average conversations in public places and made notes. And in a survey of 1,200 \"laugh episodes,\" he found that only 10%-20% of laughs were generated by anything resembling a joke. The other 80%-90% of comments that received a laugh were dull non-witticisms like, \"I'll see you guys later\" and \"It was nice meeting you, too.\"[1]. <\/p>\n\n<h1>Reason<\/h1>\n\n<p>One reason could be is that it is to make other people nearby feel good and charismatic. It is used to show you like them. It is a social signal[1,2 3]. What would support this is the fact that laughter occurs more in social situations in front of a person[4].<\/p>\n\n<p>Another, more older hypothesis is thaf the first human laughter may have begun as a g­esture of shared relief at the passing of danger. And since the relaxation that results from a bout of laughter inhibits the biological fight-or-flight response, laughter may indicate trust in one's companions. Again, this is a type of social signal.[3] Plus, this may be the reason why laughter has evolved to be contagious. Again, the fact that laughter occurs in a social situation supports this hypothesis as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that laughter isn't just a human phenomenon. It is also a mammal thing. As @GoodGravy mentioned, rats do laugh when they are tickled. But also primates laugh, especially when they play. Also, this is a social situation.[2, 4]<\/p>\n\n<h1>Summary<\/h1>\n\n<p>In short, laughter is a more primitive, ancient form of communication. We laugh as a social singal, not to say something is funny. Humor is not always the cause of laughter. It has to do with social situations. <em>It is to show support and liking for the people around you. It is to make the atmosphere more charismatic and happy.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Really, the point I am trying to get is that laughter is a primitive form of communication in social situations to show support and likeness to others.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your question is a great one and I enjoyed researching on this topic.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/men/features/why-we-laugh\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webmd.com/men/features/why-we-laugh<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[2] - <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/sophie_scott_why_we_laugh?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ted.com/talks/sophie_scott_why_we_laugh?language=en<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[3] - <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/laughter2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/laughter2.htm<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[4] - <a href=\"https://postmediavancouversun.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/extra1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://postmediavancouversun.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/extra1.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":39665,"question_id":39539,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1446101356}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39539/why-do-we-laugh","last_activity_date":1456721360,"creation_date":1444732695,"answer_count":4,"title":"Why do we laugh?","body":"<p>Why is it that the reaction we get from absurdity is laughter?

As you have pointed out there are obvious advantages to being a hermaphroditic species such as more chance of mating - more likely to provide an advantage at very low population densities where interactions are infrequent.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two key disadvantages of hermaphroditism which I will briefly cover but have been discussed in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519377903630\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a> and probably other costs. <\/p>\n\n<p>The first is energy costs. Maintaining the capacity to produce male and female gametes will be more costly than maintaining one. This gives the hermaphrodite a fitness disadvantage because energy is rarely an infinite resource. Therefore at higher population densities, when mating opportunities are not rare, the gonochoric individuals will have a higher fitness because they have more energy. Monogamy is also analogous to rare encounters but true monogamy is rare (1 partner for life).<\/p>\n\n<p>The second disadvantage of hermaphroditism is self fertilisation. This will cause an increase in homozygosity and lead to inbreeding depression (reduced fitness).<\/p>\n\n<p>So you are right to some extent...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the hermaphrodite way of reproduction is more successful than the\n  \"normal\" way.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>...but the conditions which give rise to an hermaphroditic advantage are restricting. Overall, the above costs, combined with the obvious complexity of evolving the ability to produce male and female gametes, the ability to both fertilise and be fertilised, pregnancy and birth, and mating systems, mean that it is often more beneficial to be a dioecious species. Thus dioecy evolves.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: Question Raised by @Single_Digit<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been pondering this question for a while and I get what RG255\n  is saying. I'm just not sure I entirely buy it. Take earthworms, for\n  example. They are simultaneous true hermaphrodites (as far as I\n  understand). The anatomy doesn't have to be that complex*. They simply\n  have two genital openings (one for eggs and one for sperm) and they\n  line up in a \"69\" (excuse the vulgarity) position. This should, in\n  theory, minimize the inbreeding depression. However, it doesn't\n  eliminate the maintenance of two sets of reproductive systems. But\n  most organisms are not internally fertilized mammals with wildly\n  complicated systems of internalized embryonic care. Most species lay a\n  pile of eggs that a male squirts sperm on or squirt eggs while the\n  male squirt sperm and then they hope for the best.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I would think the advantages of simultaneous parenting (after all,\n  many MANY species' males don't provide much in the way of child care)\n  and its fitness advantage would vastly outweigh the burden of a second\n  set of reproductive organs.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>With that said, I don't have a better explanation, but I find the\n  question a very interesting one. The linked article is pay-walled,\n  aside from the abstract, but I still disagree with some of its tenets.\n  To me true hermaphroditism should be very common (I realize it isn't)\n  in species that don't need two parents to raise offspring, but do\n  benefit from some (as in one parent's) parental care. I recognize that\n  it would do little to help species that merely dump gametes and leave\n  because specialization of one reproductive system would likely do the\n  job better and both genders equally contribute under that type of\n  system.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>So, RG255 convince me! Clearly there are good reasons, since gender\n  (or asexual repr) is the norm, but I need more/better evidence.<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><ul>\n  <li>Yes I realize they would need separate internal anatomies for each type of gamete, but still...<\/li>\n  <\/ul><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My response:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have presented one example of hermaphroditism and used that as\n  evidence that all species should be hermaphrodites. Earthworms are\n  small slow creatures living in soil, I don't imagine they have high\n  rates of encounter, and therefore low rates of encountering the\n  opposite sex, therefore hermaphroditism would be favoured as discussed\n  above. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Further, you say most species are external fertilisers (do you\n  have a reference for this?) and therefore it is not costly be a\n  hermaphrodite.

I don't have a\n  reference, but I was thinking all multicellular life and I'd have to\n  imagine that when you factor in plants, that external fertilization is\n  relatively the norm (as is hermaphrodism (dioecy) for the plants). As\n  to earthworms, I disagree about your description of them. Their\n  densities are actually pretty high, so I'd wager they encounter each\n  other frequently, so I'm not sure where that leaves them in terms of\n  pressures for hermaphroditism. Your point on the physiologic/hormonal\n  issues of maintaining the systems is one I haven't previously\n  considered. I honestly don't have any clue as to how daunting (or\n  simple) that is, but I'd imagine that the sophistication of the\n  systems would play a pretty key role. Makes me wonder how much this\n  has been researched in true hermaprhodites. I suppose the main thing I\n  keep coming back to is the overwhelming disadvantage gender has in\n  terms of potential to create offspring. Males in many (most?) species\n  essentially act as little more than sperm donors, thus half the\n  individuals have effectively zero fitness.

Sperm donor type males achieve\n  increased fitness by mating as do females - with out the male they\n  would never be fertilized. The key disadvantage of dioecy is the\n  halved (assuming equal sex ratio) frequency of potential encounters\n  that could lead to mating.

Passing on genes is fine, but if\n  offspring survival is low, does it matter? Does it simply boil down to\n  the maintenance of two repr systems plus decreased fitness from\n  inbreeding vs the increased reproductive success from extra child\n  care? Or is there more?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My response:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>r/K selection theory has generally been disregarded in the\n  evolutionary biology community due to the substantial evidence against\n  it so it is unhelpful to think of selection in this way. As long as\n  the 2 sexes strategy is more successful at passing on genes than a\n  hermaphroditic strategy it will (should) prevail.

I'm just not sure I entirely buy it. Take earthworms, for example. They are simultaneous true hermaphrodites (as far as I understand). The anatomy doesn't have to be <em>that<\/em> complex*. They simply have two genital openings (one for eggs and one for sperm) and they line up in a \"69\" (excuse the vulgarity) position. This should, in theory, minimize the inbreeding depression. \nHowever, it doesn't eliminate the maintenance of two sets of reproductive systems. But most organisms are not internally fertilized mammals with wildly complicated systems of internalized embryonic care. Most species lay a pile of eggs that a male squirts sperm on or squirt eggs while the male squirt sperm and then they hope for the best.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would think the advantages of simultaneous parenting (after all, many MANY species' males don't provide much in the way of child care) and its fitness advantage would vastly outweigh the burden of a second set of reproductive organs. <\/p>\n\n<p>With that said, I don't have a better explanation, but I find the question a very interesting one. The linked article is pay-walled, aside from the abstract, but I still disagree with <em>some<\/em> of its tenets. To me true hermaphroditism should be very common (I realize it isn't) in species that don't need two parents to raise offspring, but <strong>do<\/strong> benefit from some (as in one parent's) parental care. I recognize that it would do little to help species that merely dump gametes and leave because specialization of one reproductive system would likely do the job better and both genders equally contribute under that type of system.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, RG255 convince me! Clearly there are good reasons, since gender (or asexual repr) is the norm, but I need more/better evidence.<\/p>\n\n<p>* - Yes I realize they would need separate internal anatomies for each type of gamete, but still...<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Well fair enough about my external fertilizers comment. I don't have a reference, but I was thinking all multicellular life and I'd have to imagine that when you factor in plants, that external fertilization is relatively the norm (as is hermaphrodism (dioecy) for the plants).\nAs to earthworms, I disagree about your description of them. Their densities are actually <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071707001757\" rel=\"nofollow\">pretty high<\/a>, so I'd wager they encounter each other frequently, so I'm not sure where that leaves them in terms of pressures for hermaphroditism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your point on the physiologic/hormonal issues of maintaining the systems is one I haven't previously considered. I honestly don't have any clue as to how daunting (or simple) that is, but I'd imagine that the sophistication of the systems would play a pretty key role. Makes me wonder how much this has been researched in true hermaprhodites. I suppose the main thing I keep coming back to is the overwhelming disadvantage gender has in terms of potential to create offspring. Males in many (most?) species essentially act as little more than sperm donors, thus half the individuals have effectively zero fitness. That just seems like an overwhelming advantage for hermaphrodites. <\/p>\n","answer_id":5347,"question_id":5148,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1354018198},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e17137b36ea73152d422cb7c25e9305f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3835,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3835/andra-deanu","reputation":9,"display_name":"Andra Deanu"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1371729724,"creation_date":1371683252,"body":"<p>This is a bit expressed in an unclear way but I think it solves the problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the reason is simply that if you have all the hermaphrodites being difficult about their mates they will evolve fast because the best mates will mate more and the worst won't mate a lot. But if the hermaphrodite individual is hard to get, it also  won't be motivated to pursue sex and it will be hard for the 'best' individuals to mate more cause they will be too hard to get.  So the requirement to impress while also being hard to get are contradictory in non differentiated individuals. In most animals, the difference in libido of the female versus that of the male can solve this paradox. One has to show they have good genetic material (the male) and the other just have to be hard to get. This is pretty shitty for females, but nature often is. I think the fitness of this difference almost disappears in monogamous species where both have an advantage if they are hard to get. So we can hope hermaphroditism is not an advantage only for an intermediary stage of evolution but can become one again in higher species.

Imagine species A where 90% of offspring are female; at moderate population density, the 10% male population will be more than sufficient to maintain the females, and having 90% of the population able to breed will out-compete another species with a 50/50 distribution.  However, a mutation which tends to produce more males will tend to become more common, because the males of species A reproduce much more often than the females.  Eventually, this stabilizes at roughly equal frequencies for the sexes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Back to the hermaphroditic species C, imagine that a mutation led to a variant which had a flawed female reproductive system, meaning it could not lay as many eggs when fertilized, but it had some other advantage which made it better at mating: perhaps by diverting energy from the female systems, it was slightly larger and stronger and could intimidate others, or perhaps it put this energy into a stronger immune system.  Eventually, the population evolving in this direction could lose its ability to lay eggs or birth young entirely, and instead focus entirely on being better at finding mates to impregnate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking at it from the other side, if some individuals de-prioritize that side of things and instead concentrate on being the best egg-layers and care-providers possible, that could be a stronger evolutionary position than trying to be equally good at both roles.

I won't give you a complete overview of the different hypothesis the could explain why we age but here is a fundamental concept that is to know.<\/p>\n\n<p>We'll assume that there is some extrinsic mortality, mortality against which a lineage won't never be able to escape and I think it is not an assumption that is hard to meet. Therefore, an allele that has age-specific effect such as decreasing the fecundity at age 3 will undergo a higher selection pressure and will faster get eliminated from the population than another allele causing the same decrease in fecundity but at age 4 because some individuals would have died between age 3 and age 4. In other words, natural selection is more efficient at lower age than at higher age. Now, imagine in humans an allele that increases the reproductive success of an individual at age 20 by decreasing the survival at age 78. This allele will easily spread in the population. Such alleles are said to have <em>age-specific antagonist pleiotropic<\/em> effect. And empirical studies have shown that alleles that have antagonist age-specific antagonist pleiotropic exist.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, it is because there is some extrinsic mortality that natural selection acts with a different strength at different ages allowing some deleterious allele at old age to fix in the population especially if those alleles have age-specific antagonist pleiotropic effect.

There are several things to consider when we think of how genes that cause disease, aging, and death to evolve.<\/p>\n\n<p>One explanation for the evolution of aging is the <a href=\"http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/mutation_accumulation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>mutation accumulation<\/strong> (<strong>MA<\/strong>)<\/a> hypothesis. This hypothesis by P. Medawar states that mutations causing late life deleterious (damaging) effects can build up in the genome more than diseases that cause early life disease. This is because selection on late acting mutations is weaker. Mutations that cause early life disease will more severely reduce the fitness of its carrier than late acting mutations. For example, if we said in an imaginary species that all individuals cease to reproduce at 40 years old and a mutation arises that causes a fatal disease at 50 years old then selection can not remove it from the population - carriers will have as many children as those who do not have the gene. Under the mutation accumulation hypothesis it is then possible for mutations to <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIDGeneticdrift.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">drift<\/a> through the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another hypothesis which could contribute to aging is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>antagonistic pleiotropy<\/strong> (<strong>AP<\/strong>)<\/a> hypothesis of G.C. Williams. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pleiotropy<\/a> is when genes have more than one effect, such genes tend to cause correlations between traits, height and arm length probably have many of the same genes affecting them, otherwise there would be no <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8793422\" rel=\"nofollow\">correlation between arm length and height<\/a> (though environment and linkage can also cause these patterns)... Back to AP as an explanation for aging, if a gene improves fitness early in life, but causes late life disease it can spread through the population via selection. The favourable early effect spreads well because of selection and, just as with MA, selection can not \"see\" the late acting disease.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under both MA and AP the key point is that selection is less efficient at removing late acting deleterious mutations, and they may spread more rapidly thanks to beneficial early life effects. Also if there is extrinsic mortality (predation etc.) then the effect of selection is also weakened on alleles that affect late life. The same late-life reduction in the efficacy of selection also slows the rate at which alleles increasing lifespan spread.<\/p>\n\n<p>A third consideration is the <a href=\"http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/disposable_soma.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>disposable-soma model<\/strong><\/a>, a description by T. Kirkwood of life-history trade-offs which might explain why aging and earlier death could be favoured. The idea is that individuals have a limited amount of resources available to them - perhaps because of environmental constraints or ability to acquire/allocate the resources. If we then assume that individuals have to use their energy for two things, staying alive via repair and maintenance (somatic-maintenance) and making offspring (reproductive-investment), then any energy devoted to one will take away from the other. If an individual carries a gene that makes it devote all of its energy to somatic maintenance then its fitness will be very low (probably 0!) and that gene will not spread. If the level of maintenance required to live forever costs more energy than an individual can spare without suffering from low fitness (very likely) or can even acquire and efficiently convert in the first place (also very likely) then high-maintenance alleles will not spread (and aging &amp; death will continue to occur). <\/p>\n\n<p>To go a little further, it is common for sexes to age differently (this is what I work on) and one possible explanation is that the sexes favour different balances of the trade off between somatic-maintenance and reproductive investment, this can lead to conflict over the evolution of genes affecting this balance and slow the rates of evolution to sex specific optima. <a href=\"http://www.cosmoid.de/zajitschek/papers/Bonduriansky2008FunctionalEcology.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper<\/a> provides a good review of the area.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarise<\/strong>, evolution has not managed to get rid of death via genetic disease etc. (intrinsic mortality) because the effect is only weakly selected against, and those alleles may provide some early life benefit, and resource limitation may also reduce the potential to increase lifespan due to trade-offs with reproductive effort. Adaptive evolution is not about the <em>survival<\/em> of the fittest but the <em>reproduction<\/em> of the fittest - the fittest allele is the one which spreads the most effectively.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong> Thanks to Remi.b for also pointing out some other considerations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another thought is that of altruistic aging - aging for the good of the population (the population is likely to contain related individuals, <em>you<\/em> are related to all other humans to some degree). In this model aging is an adaptive process (unlike in MA where it is just a consequence of weak selection). By dying an individual makes space for it's offspring/relatives to survive (because resources are then less likely to limit populations). This will stop excessive population growth which could lead to crashes in the population and so, by dying earlier, an individual promotes the likelihood that its progeny will survive. Arguments of altruistic sacrifice are often hard to promote but <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255170953_Viscous_populations_evolve_altruistic_programmed_aging_in_ability_conflict_in_a_changing_environment\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent work suggests that this is a more plausible model than once thought<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.programmed-aging.org/theories/evolvability_theories.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolvabilty theories<\/a> also suggest that aging is an adaptive process. These suggest that populations, composed of a mixture of young and old, have biases in how well adapted the members of the population are - where younger individuals are better adapted (because they were produced more recently it is likely that the environment is similar to the environment they are favoured in). Thus by removing the less well adapted individuals from a population via senescence and freeing up resources for younger better adapted individuals, a population evolves more rapidly towards it optimal state.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17091,"question_id":17077,"up_vote_count":48,"last_edit_date":1453895099},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f10ec1bd592f24ece782e2f13746a8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6571,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6571/user6571","reputation":39,"display_name":"user6571"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf11af111cab6e513d68e5e30762deb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6598,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6598/evgeni-sergeev","reputation":221,"display_name":"Evgeni Sergeev"},"score":0,"post_id":17095,"edited":false,"creation_date":1399191756,"comment_id":23217,"body":"Lifeforms that we know tend to have a mature state towards which they rapidly develop, and then live for a while after that.

Of course it will help you reproduce more if you have more fertile years, barring other linked genes. Yes, it&#39;s about the individual. The individual shares genes with others, also making it about the species.

From what I can see, Darwin never used the technical term 'variance' (I don't know how old this use of the word is), but 'variability' is often used, both with regard to accumulated variation but also meaning variation between individuals within a population. <\/p>\n\n<p>All-in-all, I could not find clear support for the idea that selection will decrease the amount of variation. However, there are number of passages where the subject of variation vs selection comes up (often indirectly), but, to me, these just as often (most often?) indicate that Darwin saw no risk that selection would reduce variation as the opposite. Here are the most interesting passages I could find (searching for combinations of 'variab*', 'selection', 'decrease' etc), with page references referring to the pdf version and a short comment below each quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A large number of individuals,\n  by giving a better chance for the appearance within\n  any given period of profitable variations, will compensate \n  for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, \n  and is, I believe, an extremely important\n  element of success.\n  (p. 44)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is clearly discussing amounts of variation within species, where large numbers can compensate for a smaller amounts of standing variability, by increasing the chance of advantageous mutations.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nothing can be effected, unless favourable variations\n  occur, and variation itself is apparently always a very\n  slow process. The process will often be greatly retarded \n  by free intercrossing. Many will exclaim that\n  these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to\n  stop the action of natural selection. I do not believe\n  so. On the other hand, I do believe that natural selection \n  will always act very slowly, often only at long\n  intervals of time, and generally on only a very few\n  of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time.\n  (p. 103)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Not directly related to selection vs variation, but deals with the rate of evolution vs amount of variation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But what here more\n  especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals \n  those points, which at the present time are undergoing \n  rapid change by continued selection, are\n  also eminently liable to variation. Look at the breeds\n  of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference \n  there is in the beak of the different tumblers,\n  in the beak and wattle of the different carriers, in the\n  carriage and tail of our fantails, &amp;c., these being the\n  points now mainly attended to by English fanciers.\n  Even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, \n  it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly\n  to perfection, and frequently individuals are born\n  which depart widely from the standard. There may\n  be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between, \n  on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to\n  a less modified state, as well as an innate tendency\n  to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other\n  hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed\n  true. In the long run selection gains the day, and we\n  do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse\n  as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain.\n  But as long as selection is rapidly going on, there\n  may always be expected to be much variability in\n  the structure undergoing modification.\n  (p. 141)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is maybe the most interesting passage, which to me indicates that he saw little risk that selection could/would limit variability (see especially beginning and end).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For forms existing in larger\n  numbers will always have a better chance, within\n  any given period, of presenting further favourable\n  variations for natural selection to seize on, than will\n  the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence,\n  the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend\n  to beat and supplant the less common forms, for\n  these will be more slowly modified and improved.\n  (P. 162)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also on limitations for variation that selection can act on, and the value of large populations.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... firstly, because new varieties are\n  very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, \n  and natural selection can do nothing until\n  favourable variations chance to occur, and until a\n  place in the natural polity of the country can be better \n  filled by some modification of some one or more\n  of its inhabitants. And such new places will depend\n  on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration \n  of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still\n  more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants \n  becoming slowly modified, with the new forms\n  thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting\n  on each other.\n  (p. 163)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>On the limiting nature of variation, but does not connect selection to decreased variation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It cannot be asserted that organic beings\n  in a state of nature are subject to no variation; it cannot \n  be proved that the amount of variation in the\n  course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear\n  distinction has been, or can be, drawn between spe-\n  cies and well-marked varieties.\n  (p. 425)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>On variation over the long run.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are the most interesting sections I found on the subject from my (quick and limited) searches. I hope you find them useful.

In few words: because RNA can act as a protein and it is so similar to DNA, probably our DNA-world (i.e. information stored on the DNA, work done by proteins, RNA between the two) emerged from a fully RNA-world, where RNA was responsible for both protein activity and information storage.\nHow in detail all this happened by evolution, is probably the subject of several nobel prizes to come.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world#.22Molecular_biologist.27s_dream.22\" rel=\"nofollow\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":43112,"question_id":43111,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1456695651},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ay2bH.gif?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22057,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22057/david","reputation":1825,"display_name":"David"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456694469,"creation_date":1456694469,"body":"<p>Although I am of the same opinion as fpdx and the majority of scientists \u2014 that there was an RNA world in which the genetic material and the catalytic molecules were RNA (rather than DNA and protein, respectively) \u2014 there are some quite respectable scientists who hold a different view.

These cells produce the pigment which is subsequently transported into the cells which produce the hair and integrated into the hair matrix.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides genetic reasons, there are two major ways of loosing this pigmentation. First, as a part of the normal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth\" rel=\"nofollow\">hair cycle<\/a>, the hair grows for a while until it falls out and the hair follicle regresses. In this process the cells in the hair follicle die, including which made the hair as well as of the melanocytes. In this step of the hair cycle the hair follicle changes its morphology. When a new haircycle starts, the pigment cells in the hair follicle are replenished from a stem cell population called melanocyte stem cells. These cells are located in the hair bulge (marked in red in the figure below). The cells then start to proliferate to multiply their number. Few of these cells stay stem cells (to be able to repopulate the pigment cells after the next hair cycle) other differentiate into melanocytes which subsequently migrate towards the bottom of the hair bulb (shown in green in the figure). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5tFDA.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Over time, the number of stem cells gets lower and at some point, there are none left. This leads to a situation where the pigment cells are not replenished at the beginning of a new hair cycle and the hair stays unpigmented. As this is a continous process, the pigmentation gets weaker before it is completely lost. As far as this process is understood to date, this depigmentation is irreversible.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two very interesting papers about this topic:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740500293X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melanocyte Stem Cell Maintenance and Hair Graying<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23018363\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melanocyte stem cells: biology and current aspects.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The other reason for loosing pigmentation (temporarily or permanent) is the generation of so called \"reactive oxygen species\" (Hydrogenperoxide) in the cells of the hair follice, which then destroy the pigment. This is basically the same reaction which is used to bleach hairs, but in this instance from inside. This reaction can have numerous reasons, among them are vitiligo and stress. The reason for the build-up of the hydrogenperoxides is that enzymes, which usually break them down before they can cause harm are either mutated or downregulated. If the level of these enzymes (the catalases) goes back to normal, pigmentation is also getting back to normal. This has been tested experimentally with people which suffer from the pigmentation disease vitiligo.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929555/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxidative Stress in Ageing of Hair<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/early/2013/04/29/fj.12-226779.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Basic evidence for epidermal H2O2/ONOO−-mediated oxidation/nitration\nin segmental vitiligo is supported by repigmentation of skin and\neyelashes after reduction of epidermal H2O2 with topical\nNB-UVB-activated pseudocatalase PC-KUS<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":21174,"question_id":14919,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1456687844},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":21175,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410348088,"comment_id":33214,"body":"In the case of drug induced pigmentation changes, there are two possibilities.

Here is the thing:<\/p>\n\n<p>Lesch K-P, et al. (1996) say that people with short alleles of 5-HTTLPR are more prone to anxiety and depression. Pezawas (2005) also say that short allele carriers have worse anterior cingulate cortex - amygdala connectivity, which is observed among MDD patients. This, however, doesn't make much sense to me, since I'd expect people with short allels to have underperforming serotonin transporter - and isn't it overperforming serotonin transporter that contributes to depression by preventing serotonin transmission by sending it back to the presynaptic neuron? So, wouldn't you expect people with long alleles then to be prone to depression more?<\/p>\n\n<p>To complicate things further, Willeit et al. (2008) do say that enhanced 5-HTT is observed in Depression.

This can be considered by forgetting that the two DNA strands are separate and thinking of them as merged together like a rope or an electric cable in my diagram below. The cable is wrapped around an axis, which can be thought of as an imaginary rod. One could wrap the cable tightly round the axis so it was always in contact with itself and no space in between (as on the extreme left), or one can wrap it round less tightly with space in between (subsequent images). The latter is what happens and the space left by the wrapping of the rope is the major groove (because it's wider than the minor groove we come to next).<\/p>\n\n<p>So to your question, what causes this winding to be the way it is \u2014 which is to say what causes the particular pitch of the DNA helix? This is presumably the most thermodynamically stable conformation, maximizing the strength of the hydrogen bonding between the bases (most linear, not too close or too distant) and minimizes steric and electric replusion (the phosphate backbone is negatively charged).<\/p>\n\n<p>Next the MINOR groove. We now have to consider that our 'cable' is actually two strands of DNA \u2014 a sugar phosphate backbone with the paired bases in the centre. Although the bases are in the centre, the space between the two sugar-phosphate strands is not completely occupied. This creates another groove - the minor groove - less wide and of quite different origin to the major groove, but still able to accomodate certain small proteins. As it happens, this is the case with the electric cable analogy illustrated. The cable is two electric wires, but they are encased in the same plastic inuslator.<\/p>\n\n<p>So to your question, what causes the minor groove? This is just the three dimensional shape of the DNA double-strand which reflects the molecules that make it up. The large phosphate groups can be considered like wide tubes at either side, whereas the bases between the strands are flat and so lead to a groove, irrespective of whether it is wound into a helix or (in one's imagination) stretched out.<\/p>\n\n<p>(The 'major' groove is exaggerated in size compared to the 'minor' groove in the cable analogy, but I hope it illustrates the difference between the two.)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eJnHL.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eJnHL.png\" alt=\"Cable analogy of major and minor grooves of DNA helix\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":43674,"question_id":43647,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1456655672}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43647/how-do-the-major-and-minor-grooves-in-the-dna-helix-arise","last_activity_date":1456657844,"creation_date":1456371114,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do the major and minor grooves in the DNA helix arise?","body":"<p>I understand that they arise due to the pairing of bases of two opposite stands and are sites through which important proteins needed for replication and transcription of DNA interact.

That is, the amount of pigment is determined additively by the genes. For the basic genetics of it I will give a simple example, which is just illustrative and a gross oversimplification, it's probably much more complex (many loci all acting at once).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Imaginary example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose skin colour is affected by a single locus (at one position) within the DNA, which determines the amount of pigment produced. At this locus there are two alleles within a population, that is two versions of the DNA (e.g. ACGTCCATT and GACTTAACT are different DNA sequences). Allele one ($A_1$) produces a small amount of pigment, and allele 2 ($A_2$) produces a large amount. Thus people with $A_1 A_1$ genotype (people are diploid, i.e. they get a version from each parent) have light skin, $A_2 A_2$ genotypes have dark skin, and $A_1 A_2$ have an intermediate skin colour. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Analogy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is analogous to mixing fruit juice with water - if you mix <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribena\" rel=\"nofollow\">blackcurrant cordial<\/a> with water the colour is determined by the proportions. If you put out two bottles, one with cordial and one with water, allow two people to randomly choose a bottle, and use their choices to mix a glass of drink, 50% of the time you will end up with 1/2 water mixed with 1/2 cordial, while 25% of the time just a glass full of water, and the remaining 25% of the time just a glass full of cordial.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why stripes don't occur<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Note: although stripes occur in animals including humans (see chris' answer), it's not I'm the way your question insinuates<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>For stripes to occur you would have to have structure in the skin with two different types of skin cell, where bands/stripes of type occur - alternating between expressing the allele inherited from the mother, and that inherited from the father. That would require structure in the skin and something called genomic imprinting so parent of origin could be a factor. <\/p>\n\n<p>The analogy with the glass of cordial is what going on in each cell, for stripes you would have to have organised and alternating clusters of glasses (cells) which get their contents determined by one individuals choice of cordial, with the selector alternating with the cluster of glasses.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35665,"question_id":35661,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1435993926},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q7qa9X6M8oE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACB4/NnR8G0JQGZc/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16041,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16041/solarlunix","reputation":1965,"display_name":"SolarLunix","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":35668,"edited":false,"creation_date":1435956514,"comment_id":58694,"body":"And aren&#39;t cat pigments controlled by one gene?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dee334d11391632e5c2ba4709d942c96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16512,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16512/nicolas-barbulesco","reputation":125,"display_name":"Nicolas Barbulesco"},"score":0,"post_id":35668,"edited":false,"creation_date":1436870844,"comment_id":59566,"body":"What about cats?"}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1435672604,"creation_date":1435671110,"body":"<p>The reason that there are no stripes when black and white people get babies is the fact that the number of pigment cells is the same for black and white people.

The <strong>brain<\/strong> is the organ <strong>most sensitive<\/strong> to hypoxia (<a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1988699-overview#a3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medscape<\/a>). <strong>Nerve cells<\/strong> in the brain can <strong>survive only up to four minutes<\/strong> without oxygen (<a href=\"http://firstaidandcprcourses.ca/asphyxia-causes-signs-and-symptoms-complications-and-first-aid-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\">First Aid and CPR courses<\/a>). Consciousness is lost after approximately three minutes (<a href=\"http://www.forensicpathologyonline.com/E-Book/asphyxia/drowning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forensic Pathology<\/a>). Permanent brain damage begins after approximately 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000013.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medline<\/a>). Asphyxial deaths typically involve respiratory arrest with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia\" rel=\"nofollow\">bradycardia<\/a> / <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asystole\" rel=\"nofollow\">asystole<\/a> (low heart rate / cardiac arrest) because of the <strong>hypoxia-induced dysfunction of the respiratory centers in the brainstem<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.forensicpathologyonline.com/E-Book/asphyxia/drowning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forensic Pathology<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite the small size of the brain (2% of body weight), it is, however, the largest consumer of total body oxygen (20%) and glucose (25%), which are delivered by 15% of the total cardiac output <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778571\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Schur &amp; Rigor, 1998)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>A lack of oxygen may result in so called <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/973501-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy<\/a> (HIE), i.e., neuronal cell death due to hypoxia. Its pathophysiology is related to the lack of energy because cellular respiration diminishes. This initially causes neurons to stop firing, and eventually in an arrest of cellular functions and cell death. Even sublethal HIE can set in motion a series of toxic reactions that kills injured neurons and even neurons that have not been damaged during the initial insult. Thus, following global <a href=\"http://www.columbianeurosurgery.org/conditions/cerebral-ischemia/\" rel=\"nofollow\">brain ischemia<\/a>, neurons do not die suddenly or all at once. In some of them, damage develops hours or days after the insult. Most neurons undergo <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002266.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">necrosis<\/a>. In some neurons, HIE triggers <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">apoptosis<\/a> (<a href=\"http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neuropathology<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, energy depletion is believed to result in a failure of the <a href=\"http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2010/Palmer/TheSodium-PotassiumPump.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup> ATPase<\/a>, leading to depolarization of the neuronal membrane (Fig. 1). Synaptic function and conductivity cease at this point. Depolarization causes neurons to release <strong>glutamate<\/strong> (Glu) into the synaptic cleft. Glu is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter. In small amounts, it is indispensable for neuronal function. In excessive amounts, however, it is neurotoxic. Some Glu receptors, such as the NMDA and AMPA receptors, are non-selective cation-permeable ion channels. Initially, over-activation of these channels causes a <strong>passive influx<\/strong> of  Cl<sup>-<\/sup> (and Na<sup>+<\/sup>) into cells causing osmotic (cytotoxic) <strong>edema<\/strong> and <strong>rapid death<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neuropathology<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional structural damage develops hours or even days later as a result of Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> influx into neurons through NMDA and AMPA receptors (Fig. 1). This delayed cell death is caused by an over-activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors by the excessive release of glutamate, which causes massive influx of Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> into neurons. Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> activates catabolic enzymes (proteases, phospholipases, endonucleases), and also NO synthase. NO is a free radical and other free radicals are generated due to the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. Free radicals and activated catabolic enzymes destroy structural proteins, membrane lipids, nucleic acids, and other cellular contents, causing neuronal necrosis. DNA damage from endonucleases and mitochondrial injury from free radicals trigger apoptosis (<a href=\"http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neuropathology<\/a>).

After the proteins have been made,the DNA template supercoils by the force to make chromatin. RNA polymerase also influence DNA strand to have two different supercoiled directions.

Elephants occupy a large number of habitat types and populations cover vast ranges, it is very difficult to protect an entire population range such that elephants could freely and safely move throughout their range (particularly at national borders), but things are getting better in many cases and <a href=\"http://pamsfoundationtanzania.org/portfolio/ruvuma-elephant-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\">efforts are ongoing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">An increasing number of transboundary elephant populations are co-managed through the collaboration of relevant neighbouring Range States.

These animals are dependent on sea ice which, with human caused climate change, is rapidly declining. Climate change poses a more serious threat to polar bears. Relative to many things, like poaching and habitat fragmentation, it will take a <em>very<\/em> long time to reverse the tide; it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/19/frontpagenews.climatechange\" rel=\"nofollow\">may even be too late<\/a> to prevent fatal damage to the polar bear habitat. They are also at risk from <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22823/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">hunting, pollution, and habitat disturbance<\/a>. Realistically, it is hard to predict when (or if) polar bears will go extinct because there is so much variance in the prediction of climate change and loss of habitat (sea ice).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Giant Panda, status: endangered<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Less than <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/giant-panda\" rel=\"nofollow\">2000 pandas are left in the wild<\/a>. Hunting and habitat loss remain to be enormous problems for wild pandas; masses of deforestation and fragmentation is occurring in their range. The chinese government has established >50 panda reserves, but this covers around ~60% of the population. The population trend is a <em><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/712/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">decreasing<\/a><\/em> one, which is serious cause for concern, and fragmentation of populations could reduce genetic diversity (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43485/would-a-colony-with-only-one-male-and-female-collapse/43505#43505\">increasing inbreeding depression and reducing adaptive capacity<\/a>). Despite popular belief, <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/panda_life_cycle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pandas reproduce fairly well in the wild, it is in captivity that we have struggled<\/a>, and that causes problems for breeding programs that can boost numbers and restore genetic diversity to sub-populations.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mountain Gorilla, status: endangered<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Fewer than <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/mountain-gorilla\" rel=\"nofollow\">1000 mountain gorillas<\/a> are left in the wild and <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/39994/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">populations are <em>declining<\/em><\/a>. Habitat encroachment, deforestation for the charcoal industry, bushmeat, and poaching are major issues affecting populations, and much has been fuelled by conflict (e.g. the 1990's war in Rwanda) in their range (<a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/mountain-gorilla\" rel=\"nofollow\">in the last 20 years, 140 Virunga rangers have been killed trying to protect Gorillas<\/a>).

The range of tigers is under increasing <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136899/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">pressure from encroachment<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, few models will be able to predict when or if any of these species will go extinct. Even if the short-term problems can be overcome, loss of genetic diversity prevents issues for the long-term prosperity of these species. Many of the problems are fixable in a relatively short time but will take a lot of effort and money, (such as poaching, hunting, deforestation) because they are mainly about cultural and social issues. <\/p>\n\n<p>Climate change is perhaps more concerning because reversing the effects of human caused climate change will be extremely difficult (social and economic pressure), and slow to reverse; by the time we reverse the trend of rapidly declining sea ice it may be too late. Therefore, out of your species I'd say it's a close call between polar bears (despite good numbers they perhaps have the worst prospects of rescue) and mountain gorrilas (because numbers are so low and conservation projects are fighting difficult problems such as poverty and the effects of decades of civil wars and unrest). <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100324-gorillas-extinct-africa-un-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> from national geographic suggests mountain gorillas may have as little as ten years left, while polar bears <em>may<\/em> be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141107-will-polar-bears-become-extinct\" rel=\"nofollow\">able to cope with some amount of warming, but the rate of warming is a major concern<\/a>.<sup>**<\/sup> The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6041990/Chinas-giant-panda-faces-extinction-in-two-to-three-generations.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWF has also warned<\/a> that pandas are not far from extinction. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens if we lose these species?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Many of these species are very attractive to the general public. The loss of some species would likely be worse than others; many of these are used to promote ecotourism and this would have varying effects for each. For the cases of black rhinos and african elephants many of these areas have many other species which are of interest to ecotourists (lions, leopards, cheetahs, white rhino, giraffe, crocodiles, buffalo, and many other mammals and birds, even sharks). However, if black rhinos went extinct then there would probably be losses in those species too (they face many of the same problems). Ecotoruism in the relevant areas tigers and pandas on the other hand are hugely important draws, India and China simply don't have the same diversity and abundance of highly sought after species with which to boost ecotourism should either go extinct (there are other nice species in these areas, but few are as highly sought as tigers and pandas). It's much the same for mountain gorillas and polar bears, these areas have less to fall back on should their species go extinct, so in many cases these species are of major economic importance.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, losing one or two of these species <em>could<\/em> cause some good. The outrage at losing some of the most popular animals in the world would be enormous. Funding for conservation and social pressure would likely swing massively more in favour of conservation efforts, making the fight to protect other species easier.

Gills collapse on land because of the lack of buoyancy (source: <a href=\"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=4461\">UC Santa Barbara<\/a>). Octopuses have three hearts. Two of these are dedicated to move blood to the animal\u2019s gills, emphasizing the animal's dependence on its gills for oxygen supply. The third heart keeps circulation flowing to the organs. This organ heart actually stops beating when the octopus swims, explaining the species\u2019 tendency to crawl rather than swim (source: <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-curious-facts-about-octopuses-7625828/\">Smithsonian<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/land-walking-octopus-explained-video/\">Scientific American<\/a>, crawling out of the water is not uncommon for species of octopus that live in intertidal waters or near the shore (Fig. 1). Because most species of octopus are nocturnal, we humans just don't see it often. Their boneless bodies are seemingly unfit for moving out of water, but it is thought to be food-motivated, e.g. shellfish and snails that can be found in tidal pools. <\/p>\n\n<p>Octopuses depend on water to breathe, so in addition to being a cumbersome mode of transportation, the land crawl is also a gamble. When their <strong>skin stays moist<\/strong>, a limited amount of gas exchange can occur through <strong>passive diffusion<\/strong>. This allows the octopus to survive on land for short periods of time, because oxygen is absorbed through the skin, instead of the gills. In moist, coastal areas it is believed they can crawl on land for <strong>at least several minutes<\/strong>. Mostly they go from pool to pool, never staying out of the water for extended periods. If faced with a dry surface in the sun, they will not survive for long (source: <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/land-walking-octopus-explained-video/\">Scientific American<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wr2fh.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wr2fh.jpg\" alt=\"octopus\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1. Octopus on land. Source: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p039cmty/p039cj69\">BBC<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Your sub questions; I <em>think<\/em> small octopuses may survive longer, since passive gas exchange is the mode of survival on land. In general, an increase in diameter causes the volume to increase with a third power, while surface increases with a power of two. Therefore, an <strong>increase in body size reduces the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio\">surface-to-volume ratio<\/a><\/strong> and leads to <strong>reduced gas exchange<\/strong>. Because passive gas exchange needs large surface-to-volume ratios, I am inclined to believe small octopuses may cope better with terrestrial environments. However, in hot, arid conditions it is likely a bigger one will have an advantage, because it can store more oxygen in its blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of species, I have to say I couldn't find any sources going in so much detail on this. Likely, as said, smaller species may do better in cool, moist conditions, while larger specimens may be better off in dry environments.    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/land-walking-octopus-explained-video/\">Harmon Courage, <em>Sci Am<\/em>; (November 2011)<\/a><\/sub> <\/p>\n","answer_id":43461,"question_id":43456,"up_vote_count":32,"last_edit_date":1455810258}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43456/how-long-can-an-octopus-survive-out-of-the-water","last_activity_date":1456594568,"creation_date":1455779473,"answer_count":1,"title":"How long can an octopus survive out of the water?","body":"<p>I saw videos of octopuses crawling on the ground and I was wondering how long an octopus can survive when out of the water?

They can also suppress certain harmonics and use variations of combinations of tones. <\/li>\n<li>Bats can also vary the amplitude, or loudness, of their calls (Yalden &amp; Morris, 1975). <\/li>\n<li><p>Bat calls can be composed of frequency modulated (FM) or constant frequency (CF) components or a combination of both types of calls (Jones and Rydell, 2003).   <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>FM = each signal, consisting of discrete pulses of sound (Fenton, 1983), starts at one frequency and sweeps down to another. Sweeping through a range of frequencies allows bats to achieve some protection from errors associated with Doppler shifts; in addition, the modulation of frequencies helps to tell the bat about the texture of the target (Fenton, 1983).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>While foraging, FM bats create a series of repeating ultrasonic pulses in various phases.  There are three major phases, each with an increase in repetition rate.   The change in rate across the phases can go from 4-5 pulses per second to 200 pulses per second.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>The signals bats produce may serve multiple functions; they can be used for echolocation as well as for communication, whether intentionally or unintentionally.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Use echolocation calls of others to locate roosts, and eavesdropping also allows a territorial bat to distinguish between another bat trying to steal its food or just one passing through its territory (Fenton, 1983).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>\u201cSocial calls\" (Altringham and Fenton, 2003; Wright et al., 2013).<\/p><\/li>\n<li>Collision avoidance sounds (Fenton, 1983).<\/li>\n<li>Alarm calls and distress calls when in stressful situations.<\/li>\n<li>Mother-young communication. <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":42578,"question_id":39015,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1456581242}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39015/does-this-recording-sound-like-the-pulses-emitted-by-bats","last_activity_date":1456581242,"creation_date":1443049482,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does this recording sound like the pulses emitted by bats?","body":"<p>Out of curiosity, I recorded sounds in an area with lots of bats, hoping to be able to \"hear\" the bats communicating by lowering the ultrasound to a level down to the frequency which can be heard by a human.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a bit of post-processing, I actually hear interesting sounds, but I'm not sure about the origin.

Those that are not killed immediately are trapped in mucus and swallowed. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can, obviously, search on google for another reference if you do not believe this one.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Or are they just the reflex shown?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It depends on what type of tears you are talking about. Tears are divided into 3 categories:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Basal tears<\/li>\n<li>Reflex tears<\/li>\n<li>Psychic tears<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In \"reflex action\" part:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reflex tears result from irritation of the eye by foreign particles, or from the presence of irritant substances in the eye's environment, which trigger TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channels in the ophthalmic nerve. It can also occur with bright light and hot or peppery stimuli to the tongue and mouth... These reflex tears attempt to wash out irritants that may have come into contact with the eye.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These are, of course, different from those tears which \"suddenly start flowing out of our eyes when we find our long lost friend or when someone unexpectedly decides to break up with us\". These are psychic tears:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The third category, in general, referred to as crying or weeping, is increased tearing due to strong emotional stress, pleasure, anger, suffering, mourning, or physical pain. This practice is not restricted to negative emotions; many people cry when extremely happy such as during times of intense humour and laughter.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>But the actual relation of tears with emotions can be, through <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-do-we-cry-the-science-of-tears-9741287.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a> (I don't know whether its reliable or not, I just searched for a citation), summarized as:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>there is an area of your brain specifically to deal with your emotions, called the limbic system (specifically the part of it called the hypothalamus), which is hard-wired into your autonomic nervous system (that\u2019s the part you don\u2019t have any control over). This system, via a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, has a degree of control over the lacrimal \u2018tear\u2019 system; and it is this tiny molecule which then stimulates tear production. So in short, your emotional reaction to the break-up triggers your nervous system, which in turn, orders your tear-producing system to activate.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Moving on to next part:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>crying causes endorphin release...Are tears the only way to accomplish this?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Certainly not. <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a> says<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you exercise, your body releases chemicals called endorphins. These endorphins interact with the receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>At last, I would answer this part<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What biological purpose do tears serve for the body?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v2/n2/full/eye198830a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a> which says<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tears are necessary for the continued health of the ocular surface. Normal constitutents include water, mucin, and lipids, electrolytes, non-electrolytes, and proteins... Retinoids are important for ocular health and prealbumen may be a carrier for vitamin A in the tears to supply corneal epithelium with its requirements. Changes in tear constituents may cause certain ocular disorders.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is important to know here that by the above part, I meant basal tears and not psychic ones. Basal tears, again according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>, are described as:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In healthy mammalian eyes, the cornea is continually kept wet and nourished by basal tears. They lubricate the eye, and help to keep it clear of dust. Tear fluid contains water, mucin, lipids, lysozyme, lactoferrin, lipocalin, lacritin, immunoglobulins, glucose, urea, sodium, and potassium. Some of the substances in lacrimal fluid (such as lysozyme) fight against bacterial infection as a part of the immune system. Lysozyme does this by dissolving a layer in the outer coating, called peptidoglycan, of certain bacteria. It is a typical body fluid with a salt content similar to blood plasma.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong> Now, as you asked in the comments <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what if we don't maintain our ocular surface?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I can tell you, from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923205/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a>, a very common example:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dry eye syndrome is a common tears and ocular surface multifactorial disease, described by changes in the ocular surface epithelia related to reduced tears quantity and ocular surface sensitivity, leading to inflammatory reaction...it is believed that decrease in the tear volume on the corneal and conjunctival surface caused by either a decreased tear secretion or accelerated evaporation plays the main role. The clinical features of dry eyes include ocular discomfort, feeling of dryness, feeling of eye fatigue, hyperemia, kerato-conjunctival epithelial disorders and abnormalities of vision.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":43700,"question_id":43551,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1456568743}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43551/what-biological-functions-does-crying-serve","last_activity_date":1456568743,"creation_date":1456131671,"answer_count":1,"title":"What biological functions does crying serve?","body":"<p>Tears suddenly start flowing out of our eyes when we find our long lost friend or when someone unexpectedly decides to break up with us.

Many herbivores (such as ruminants) have large, highly developed gastrointestinal tracts containing symbiotic bacteria to allow them to digest plant matter. Once the cellulose in the plant cell walls is digested, the animal can then access the nutrients  contained in the plant matter to a degree we cannot. Ruminants (such as cows) are even better able to absorb nutrients in this way than monograstric herbivores (such as horses). Rumen microbes are also an important source in ruminants for production of amino acids.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's also a reason why the GI tract of these herbivores is so big. In the cow, it's an enormous rumen. In the horse, it's a massive colon for hindgut fermentation. To get all the nutrients they need - such as amino acids - these herbivores have to consume and ferment vast quantities of plant matter. A carnivore can generally get all the nutrients it needs in a much smaller meat meal, meaning it does not need such an extensive GI tract.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Different species, of course, have different metabolic demands and corresponding nutritional needs. Cows and other herbivores cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need, meaning they have to be consumed through the diet. Though it is somewhat dated, an interesting discussion on this subject is <a href=\"http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2033629/1/IVRI%203245.pdf\">Protein and Amino Acid Requirements of Mammals (PDF)<\/a> by Anthony Albanese (1950). The author goes through in great details the different protein requirements for various species, but I will bring your attention to one interesting table on p 116 as it is pertinent to your last question:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/usrEb.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/usrEb.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the protein content of milk seems to correspond with the time to double birth weight. Cats with a high protein milk grow very quickly, while cows, horses, and humans grow comparitively more slowly (and thus have lower protein milk).<\/p>\n\n<p>All animals have to get protein or amino acids through the diet, but they just have different methods to satisfy their metabolic requirements. For carnivores, they consume small protein-packed meals. For large herbivores, they have to consume and digest large quantities of plant matter to meet their needs.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40463,"question_id":40456,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40456/how-do-large-herbivores-get-enough-protein","last_activity_date":1456530234,"creation_date":1447095007,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do large herbivores get enough protein?","body":"<p>The food they eat seem extremely low on protein.

Often if you run at higher than say 150V or so you can get bands that look like this. The resolution could also be related to..<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(2)<\/strong> I would bet the streaking is due to salt in the sample--a lot of the time lysis/wash/elution buffers can have upwards of 500 mM or 1 M salt, and this invariably causes streaking. Load less sample in these lanes and keep the total volume the same to dilute the salt below 250 mM at least. Other things in your buffers could be causing the streaking, but salt is the most common (let us know the composition of your lysis/wash/elution buffers).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(3)<\/strong> Your purification of GST alone looks very good--often your preps will look much more like the lanes you have indicated, which are not entirely clean. This is quite common for a one step purification--often you need 2-3 for certain proteins to completely remove contaminants. There are several possible sources of these bands:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Endogenous proteins: Many bacterial proteins will non-specifically stick to the beads (this is why we wash), but even thorough washing can still leave some contaminants. These proteins also could be bound to your protein of interest and are co-eluted off of the resin.<\/li>\n<li>Truncation products: Depending where your tag is (let's sat it is on the N-terminus), you can sometimes get incomplete translation products--they have the tag, but they are not full length proteins. These will still bind and elute from the beads because they have retained the tag. Ignore this point if you tag is on the C-terminus, as in that case the tag will only be on full-length protein. <\/li>\n<li>Degradation products: This is related to your later questions--often during the purification your protein will be degraded by bacterial proteases. Did you include a variety of protease inhibitors in your lysis buffer? Keeping all of your samples on ice is also important for this reason. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>(4)<\/strong> Understand that degradation products do not mean you get only your protein and the fused GST--they can be a variety of truncations due to degradation by proteases. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(5)<\/strong> I would bet this is just due to your running conditions or the salt in your samples. I think this is probably actually your single GST band.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(6)<\/strong> Glutathione will not show up on the gel--it's formula weight is about 300 g/mol if I recall meaning it's about 300 Daltons, so much smaller than anything that you'll retain on the gel. Further, remember than your stain is for proteins--Coomassie blue binds basic residues on proteins. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(7)<\/strong> I'm not sure which band you are referring to, but I think the very bottom band in your marker lane is simply the dye front. It could also be a degradation product of a protein in your ladder.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the second gel goes--it is all due to the buffer level falling during the run. Without buffer covering the top of the gel there is no current flowing. Probably as the leak was occurring you had uneven distribution of the buffer.

We also attempted to transform the normal plasmid without NFAT so that we could get GST alone.  After growing up these colonies and selecting positive colonies, we lysed the e.coli.  We collected some of this lysate for SDS-PAGE.  We then put the lysed GST and GST-NFAT solutions in separate columns with glutathione beads.  GST binds glutathione.  We washed the column and collected some of the wash for SDS-PAGE.  Finally, we eluted the GST and GST-NFAT off the column and saved some for SDS-PAGE.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I have attached a picture of a successful version of the SDS-PAGE.  <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SKcuq.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SKcuq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You want to direct your attention to the first lane, the Molecular Weight Marker (MWM).  The rest of the lanes should be interpreted in sets of 3.  The first of the three is the crude lysate, the second of the three is the first wash, and the last is the eluted protein of interest.  The important lanes for my analysis are 8-10 and 11-13.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I will explain what I know from this SDS-PAGE gel so far.  I know the weights of the different bands in the molecular weight marker because I was given a copy of the different proteins in the marker.  From this information, I was able to confirm that I isolated my protein of interest in lane 13 and isolated GST-alone in lane 10.  I also understand the reason why the lysate lanes are darkest, followed by the wash lanes, and then very clean protein of interest lanes.  Also, note that the marker and the elution lanes were loaded with 10 microliters while the other lanes were 2 microliters each. However, there are some things that I do not understand from the gel.<br>\n(1) Why are the bands so diffuse/low resolution.  I imagine it may be overloading the wells, but I am not convinced because I followed a set procedure.<br>\n(2) Why is there large amounts of streaking, especially in lanes 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11.<br>\n(3) I isolated my protein of interest because it was a fusion protein with GST (or just GST alone), and then eluted the protein off the glutathione beads via excess glutathione wash.  Theoretically, the lanes for the elutions should be free of everything except the protein of interest and glutathione then.  This mostly holds true for lanes 4 and 9, which should only have GST and glutathione.  However, lanes 7 and 13 should only have GST-NFAT and glutathione.  The lanes are not as clear however and seem to have stained numerous other proteins.  What is going on?<br>\n(4) I was told by a professor that the second band in lane 13 (the GST-NFAT lane) was a degredation product.  How can this be?  The band does not correspond to the weights of NFAT alone or GST alone.  Also, if the NFAT-GST was degraded, wouldn't there be two bands of degredation product?<br>\n(5)  Why do the GST-alone lanes have what looks like doublet-bands?  (Lanes 4, 10).<br>\n(6)  If we eluted the proteins of interest with excess glutathione, which has a very low molecular weight, why doesn't it show up on the gel?  Is it possible that it ran off before everything else?<br>\n(7)  I have a list of the weights of the bands of the molecular marker.  Yet, there is an extra band at the bottom that does not show up on my list.

How can the buffer falling cause this result?  Or is there something else that may have contributed to this weird pattern?  Finally, the lanes are not as distinct in this gel as the first gel, yet the same comb, and thus the same size and spaced wells were used.

I italicized 'used' because I think that you could argue that naturally occurring sources of irradiation have led to the selection of traits that protect us from radiation damage. <\/p>\n\n<p>That might sound like a bit of a circular argument, but keep in mind that in the case of the rice you mention, the discovery of beneficial traits came at the expense of a lot of dead rice that suffered deleterious effects of radiation. Unfortunately, the deleterious effects are a lot more likely to occur than than any really useful ones. <\/p>\n\n<p>That leads to your second question. Conceivably, radiation <em>could<\/em> lead to a beneficial mutation. However, there are some pretty big caveats with that. First, in order for it to be beneficial, this hypothetical mutation would have to occur very early on in development, otherwise it would be limited to, at best, a handful of cells, probably in your skin, which would just get sloughed off anyway. So the second caveat is that in order for such a beneficial radiation-induced mutation to occur in the right place at the right developmental time, it would have to penetrate all the layers of your mother's genetic material that separate your fetal cells from the outside world without losing the energy needed to damage your DNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>I couldn't tell you what sort of radiation might be capable of pulling that off with what probability of success, but my guess is that it's really unlikely. <\/p>\n","answer_id":43730,"question_id":43726,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43726/irradiation-positive-effect-on-humans","last_activity_date":1456520478,"creation_date":1456516324,"answer_count":1,"title":"Irradiation positive effect on humans?","body":"<p>In research paper <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AEUPH.0000014914.85465.4f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Euphytica 135: 187\u2013204, 2004<\/a> it is written that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>434 mutant varieties of rice have been released with improved characters such as semi-dwarf height,\n  early  maturity,  improved  grain  yield,  disease-  and\n  cold-tolerance, and improved grain quality.
