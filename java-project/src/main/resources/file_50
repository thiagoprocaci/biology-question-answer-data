Results suggest that VPA reopens the plasticity window that normally closes by adolescence.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the paper seems to suggest that the exact mechanism of action is unknown.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Valproic acid is believed to have multiple pharmacological actions,\n  including acute blockade of GABA transaminase to enhance inhibitory\n  function in epileptic seizures and enduring effects on gene\n  transcription as an histone deacetlyase (HDAC) inhibitor (Monti et\n  al., 2009). Of relevance here is the epigenetic actions of this drug,\n  as enhancing inhibition does not reactivate brain plasticity in\n  adulthood (Fagiolini and Hensch, 2000), but reopening chromatin\n  structure does (Putignano et al., 2007). While systemic drug\n  application is a rather coarse treatment, the effects may differ\n  dramatically by individual cell type (TK Hensch and P Carninci,\n  unpublished observations). VPA treatment mimics Nogo receptor deletion\n  to reopen plasticity for acoustic preference in mice (Yang et al.,\n  2012), suggesting a common pathway through the regulation of\n  myelin-related signaling which normally closes critical period\n  plasticity (McGee et al., 2005). Future work will address the cellular\n  actions of VPA treatment in the process of reactivating critical\n  periods. Future MRI studies will also be needed to establish whether\n  HDAC inhibition by VPA induces hyperconnectivity of myelinated,\n  long-range connections concurrent with renewed AP ability (Loui et\n  al., 2011).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So it is saying that the standard use of VPA is to increase GABA levels (which keeps firing rate down -- it is used as an antiepileptic), however it also acts as an HDAC inhibitor, which means it causes unwrapping of chromatin and consequently increased mRNA transcription, maybe even transcription of genes that would normally be entirely deactivated in an adult.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my guess is that some protein is getting produced that messages neurons to generate new axon/dendrite growth and/or new synaptic connections.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can anyone clarify how VPA might accomplish plasticity?<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT (one month later): I have more detail, but I still can't quite make the connection. Here goes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Neurites get wrapped by myelin/oligodendrocyte, which produces and exudes some of the chemical messagers {Nogo, OMgp, MAG}. The membrane surface of the neurite contains nogo 66 receptors (NgR-s) that get triggered by these messagers and inform the neuron to inhibit axon-growth. Somehow the 'HDAC inhibition' property of VPA is unwinding DNA enough to alter transcription rates of certain proteins, and one of these must be disabling the NgR.<\/p>\n\n<p>But how is this happening?<\/p>\n","question_id":19856,"tags":["neuroscience","pharmacology","synapses","neuroplasticity"],"score":17,"accepted_answer_id":34120,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":501,"up_vote_count":17,"last_edit_date":1408812386},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd6d18515221a4fcc07893118a8730a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8835,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8835/rishika","reputation":889,"display_name":"Rishika","accept_rate":100},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":34591,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432729190,"comment_id":55641,"body":"They usually have specific names - your example is the pentose-phosphate way (or pathway)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd6d18515221a4fcc07893118a8730a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8835,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8835/rishika","reputation":889,"display_name":"Rishika","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":34591,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1432729448,"comment_id":55642,"body":"is there no generalized names for such pathways?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":34591,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432729570,"comment_id":55643,"body":"If you want it short: Pathway.

In contrast, sexual arousal is defined as the autonomic physiological processes that prepare the body for sexual activity (Toledano, Pfaus., 2006). <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The brain is rightfully regarded as the largest sexual organ, with most of the pleasure arising from the limbic system of the brain (which interestingly enough, is common to all mammals  regulating emotion and encouraging the avoidance of painful of aversive stimuli and the repetition of pleasurable experiences).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From a physiological perspective sexual arousal is controlled by the parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system and manifests itself as vasodilation in sexual organs along with several other physiological phenomena including an increase in heart rate. An orgasm and in particular male ejaculation is controlled by the sympathetic portion, this is also accompanied by deactivation of many areas in the brain relating to external stimuli in particular fear, allowing the mind to focus on the task at hand.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now it is a bit long to go into the details of the sexual response cycle, and hence here is a brief summary:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Neural pathways:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Prior to the physical stimulation, comes sexual desire. Largely mediated by emotion through the limbic system, activation of the amygdala can trigger penile erection, sexual feelings,(Georgiadis and Holstege, 2005) sensations of extreme pleasure (Olds and Milner, 1954), memories of sexual intercourse (Gloor, 1986), as well as ovulation, uterine contractions, and orgasm.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The amygdala is sexually differentiated part of the brain that is known to produce sex specific responses. In short the amygdala has a pathway (amygdalofugal pathway) that connects with the major regions of the brain that regulates sexual feelings. An increased density of enkephalins and opiate receptors can be also found in amydala, which induces extreme feelings of pleasure. <\/p>\n\n<p>interestingly...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Males more then females, were found to have greater amygdala activation when presented with a sexually pleasing, visual stimuli (Hamann et al., 2004).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Moving on, other areas of the brain implicated in sexual arousal are...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Input travels from the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala along the amygdalofugal pathway to the ventral striatum, made up of the nucleus accumbens, putamen and parts of the caudate nucleus. The nucleus accumbens plays a role in pleasure and reward due to a large large of dopaminergic neurons from the VTA (ventral tegmental area).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The Vagus nerve is known to lead to the Nucleus Tractus Solitarii (NTS) in the Medulla Oblongata.  Following this stimulation of the brain via the vagus nerve during orgasm there was a difference in activity between preorgasm and orgasm. Areas of activation during and after orgasm include the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), midbrain central gray, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, frontal, parietal, temporal and insular cortices, anterior basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Whipple, 2008). Although this may be the explanation for female orgasms, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case for males.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Hormonal changes:<\/strong>\nI am not going to write too much about this as this information is readily accessible in the net. Sexual arousal causes the cerebral cortex to signal the hypothalamus to stimulate the production of testosterone, the production is regulated by a complex chain of events known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which ultimately causes the pitutary gland to release luteinizing hormone which signals the testes to produce testosterone and ovaries to produce oestrogen. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can read more here: <a href=\"http://neurosciencefundamentals.unsw.wikispaces.net/Sex+and+the+Brain.+What+parts+are+involved%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://neurosciencefundamentals.unsw.wikispaces.net/Sex+and+the+Brain.+What+parts+are+involved%3F<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>For an in-depth analysis I recommend this book:\n<em>Greenberg, Jerrold S., Clint E.

Your inability to find information may have been linked to terms used.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the copulation path doesn't have as much variability as the penetration path, which is what determines the copulation path.  The copulation path tends to be a relatively straight line between the two pronucleoli, dictated by and pushed along the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25061094\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lian et al, 2014<\/a>).  It is worth noting that it is often not the shortest straight line (think of the number of lines between a smaller sphere and a larger one), but still a relatively straight line.  People tend to care about this, because what ever the copulation path, it sets the axis of division, which can effect in vitro fertilization techniques, particularly in plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Getting at what I think you are trying to ask, the penetration path is variable because it is an oscillatory phenomenon.  You actually have to move back in the fertilization process to the sperm impact angle (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25659799\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hedrih et al, 2015<\/a> is the coolest model I've seen of this) to see how this can change.  <\/p>\n\n<p>To understand oscillatory phenomenon in general, you need to understand that a lot of the processes in biology are driven by the chaotic (used in the formal since) vibrating or shaking of molecules and fluid microcurrents.  This means that we can not know (regardless of how sensitive we measure) the conditions specific enough to create the specific path.

This yields loss-of-function (<em>lf<\/em>) alleles, that reduce the activity of the gene, or its product, and gain-of-function (<em>gf<\/em>) alleles that act as if they somehow increase the activity of the gene, or its product. <\/p>\n\n<p>The logic underlying this classification was described in this classic reference: Muller, H. J. 1932. Further studies on the nature and causes of gene mutations. Proceedings of the 6th International Congress of Genetics, pp. 213\u2013255.  Since this was before DNA had been shown to be the genetic material his arguments are based solely on the phenotype of animals carrying various combinations of chromosomes.  In particular he relies on genetic duplications and deficiencies (or deletions).  In this nomenclature <em>+<\/em> indicates a chromosome carrying a wild-type (<em>wt<\/em>) allele of the gene, and <em>m<\/em> indicates a chromosome carrying a mutant allele of the gene.  So if an <em>+<\/em>/<em>m<\/em> animal appears Wild-Type then that allele is recessive.  Similarly, if an <em>+<\/em>/<em>m<\/em> animal has a Mutant phenotype then the allele is dominant.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two types of <em>lf<\/em> alleles: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a hypomorph is a partial reduction in function and retains some residual gene function (e.g., a weak missense mutation, or a temperature-sensitive (<em>ts<\/em>) mutation. A hypomorph is recessive to a <em>wt<\/em> allele.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>an amorph is what we would call a true genetic and molecular null allele, a complete knockout of the gene, where there is no measurable function left (e.g., a nonsense mutation early in the protein coding region, or a small deletion that only removes a single gene).  Amorphs are normally recessive to a <em>wt<\/em> allele (but see below for an exception)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>There are three types of <em>gf<\/em> alleles:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a hypermorph that elevates the level of the <em>wt<\/em> gene function (e.g., a promoter mutation that removes a negative regulatory site, leading to increased expression). Hypermorphs are dominant.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>an antimorph, or so-called dominant-negative (<em>dn<\/em>) allele that produces a mutant gene product that somehow interferes with the <em>wt<\/em> gene product (think poison product as one model). Antimorphs are always dominant over <em>wt<\/em>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>a neomorph, an allele the results in a completely new gene function (e.g., if a glycolytic enzyme acquired sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, perhaps from a gene fusion event(?)). Neomorphic alleles are extremely rare and almost always dominant over wt.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So we have a straightforward mapping of <em>lf<\/em> alleles to recessive phenotypes, and <em>gf<\/em> alleles to dominant phenotypes.  However there is an important exception to this simple scheme for genes that are dose-sensitive, or haploinsufficient. These are dominant <em>lf<\/em> alleles. For example, when halving the level of the gene product causes a mutant phenotype: <em>+<\/em>/<em>null<\/em>.

There are two main reasons for RNA degradation during RNA analysis. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>First, RNA by its very structure is inherently weaker than DNA. RNA is made up of ribose units, which have a highly reactive hydroxyl group on C2 that takes part in RNA-mediated enzymatic events. This makes RNA more chemically labile than DNA. RNA is also more prone to heat degradation than DNA. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Secondly, enzymes that degrade RNA, ribonucleases (RNases) are so ubiquitous and hardy; removing them often proves to be nearly impossible. For example, autoclaving a solution containing bacteria will destroy the bacterial cells but not the RNases released from the cells. Furthermore, even trace amounts of RNases are able to degrade RNA. Note that RNAses are present everywhere (skin, reagents, normal plastic etc).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, it is essential to avoid inadvertently introducing RNases into the RNA sample during or after the isolation procedure.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Remember that following microbiological aseptical techniques is usually good practice (and a requirement) when working in a molecular biology lab.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are excellent guides available online for working with RNA:<\/p>\n\n<p>I took the above paragraph from here: \n<a href=\"http://www.bioline.com/us/rna-hints-and-tips\">http://www.bioline.com/us/rna-hints-and-tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Life tech has a few more tips for you: <a href=\"https://www.lifetechnologies.com/uk/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/nuclease-enzymes/general-articles/working-with-rna.html\">https://www.lifetechnologies.com/uk/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/nuclease-enzymes/general-articles/working-with-rna.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a good pdf to have in your labbook as a reference sheet:<a href=\"http://genomics.no/oslo/uploads/PDFs/workingwithrna.pdf\">http://genomics.no/oslo/uploads/PDFs/workingwithrna.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>If this scares you , that's good because when working with RNA there are a million things that can go wrong the first few times you try it.

In biological systems many reactions occur under the auspice of enzymes or proteins. These are incredibly large molecules made of an extremely long chain of amino acids which are a set of 26 or so small molecules that can 'hook' into the chain structure of a protein. Each amino acid has different properties and thus experiences different forces pulling it towards and away from other amino acids on the chain. What this means is the whole chain folds up into an extremely complex structure. For a protein to allow a reaction to occur it has a small region that the reacting molecule can hook into. There are then sets of atoms and molecules that act as scaffolds that allow atoms in the reacting molecule to be moved without the need for nearly as much energy as would be required without the scaffold. Now this is how it changes structure. Now whilst the protein can just as easily allow the molecule produced to be converted back to the original, this may be less energetically favourable which brings us to equilibrium chemistry involving dynamic forward and backward reactions. What makes this more complicated is that proteins often have separate 'hooks' for molecules to disable them. That is if a lot of substance A is around then the protein will be disabled and no longer convert B into A until more A is consumed and thus stops inhibiting the protein.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34555,"question_id":34545,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34545/factors-on-which-one-compound-transforming-to-another-compound-depend","last_activity_date":1432640154,"creation_date":1432626832,"answer_count":1,"title":"Factors on which one compound transforming to another compound depend","body":"<p>Considering the Metabolic Pathway:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00166\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00166<\/a> <br><br>\nConsider the reaction R01523(the very first reaction).

Retinal implants like the Argus II consist of a set of electrodes placed onto the degenerate retina of blind folks. Electrical stimulation of the electrode array elicits flashes of light (<em>phosphenes<\/em>). Visual input is provided via a head-mounted camera, and the device translates the camera images into patterned electrode stimuli. Hence, because the camera is head worn, Argus II wearers cannot use eye movements to scan the world. They have to use head-scanning techniques. <strong>Still they are able to perceive flashes of light (phosphenes) and can recognize simple shapes and perceive motion<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In fact, eye movements such as saccades are <em>detrimental<\/em> in Argus II wearers<\/strong>, because the oculomotor system feedbacks muscle movements to the brain when a saccade is made to stabilize the perceptual field of view. In normally sighted people the oculomotor feedback system is important, as it tells the brain to compensate the retinal image position shift when a saccade is made. Compensation occurs through a shift in the brain representation of the retinal image to the opposite direction, thereby stabilizing the image representation. However, this is detrimental in Argus II wearers, because the position of the electrode array and hence retinal position of the image is unaffected by eye position. Hence, when subjects use their implant, any saccades will disrupt visual processing, because the oculomotor system will abberantly compensate the perceived location of the object being viewed.<\/p>\n\n<p>More importantly, perhaps, are <strong>micro-saccades<\/strong>. Micro- saccades are small, involuntary eye movements. When images are present stably to the retina the images fade very quickly due to adaptive processes in retinal neurons. <strong>Micro-saccades are thought to prevent fading<\/strong>, as they constantly produce small, involuntary fluctuations in gaze, thereby shifting the image quickly over the retina, and thereby refreshing the retinal image and preventing adaptation (<a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1757/20130077\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stingl, 2013<\/a>). When Argus II wearers stop scanning the image, images indeed fade within seconds <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3676187/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Stronks, 2013)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get back to your question and summarize:<\/p>\n\n<p>Title question: <strong>No, eye muscles are not needed for sight<\/strong>, given that Argus II wearers have sight (though artificial, crude vision). However, <strong>a functional saccade system in normally sighted folks improves scanning, and anecdotally micro-saccades prevent image fading<\/strong> by constantly refreshing the retinal image.<\/p>\n\n<p>Body question: Argus II implant wearers are an example of vision without oculomotor control. <strong>Although they cannot use their eye muscles for scanning, they still have functional vision<\/strong>.\n However image fading is a problem in Argus II users and folks without functional eye muscles alike, so <strong>head scanning techniques will be needed<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>PS: Other implant systems, such as the Alpha-IMS use light-capturing methods inside the eye. Hence these subjects can use normal eye scanning and saccades for scanning. Also, albeit anecdotally, fading is reduced in Alpha-IMS wearers, because of the micro-saccades preventing adaptation (<a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1757/20130077\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stingl, 2013<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n- <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1757/20130077\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stingl et al., <em>Proc Royal Soc B<\/em> (2013); <strong>280<\/strong>(1757)<\/a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3676187/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stronks et al., <em>IOVS<\/em> (2013); <strong>54<\/strong>(6): 3891\u2013901.<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":28001,"question_id":27999,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1432612052}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27999/can-people-with-paralyzed-eye-muscles-see","last_activity_date":1432612052,"creation_date":1422135673,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can people with paralyzed eye muscles see?","body":"<p>As far as I am aware, the saccades of the eye are central to visual perception.

Australopithecine brains started to show subtle changes in structure and shape as compared with apes. however. For instance, the neocortex was expanding, which is an indication that the evolutionary pressure on <strong>higher functions of the brain<\/strong> was important. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Homo habilis<\/em>, the first of our genus <em>Homo<\/em>, who appeared 1.9 million years ago, saw a modest hop in brain size, including an expansion of a language-connected part of the frontal lobe called Broca's area. The first fossil skulls of Homo erectus, 1.8 million years ago, had brains averaging a bit larger than 600 ml. This shows that <strong>language development<\/strong> is a likely factor that has driven evolution of the human brain. <\/p>\n\n<p>By 500,000 years ago, the humanoid brain reached a volume of about 1,000 ml. Early <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> had brains within the range of people today, averaging 1,200 ml or more. It is thought that <strong>cultural<\/strong> and <strong>linguistic complexity<\/strong>, <strong>dietary needs<\/strong> and <strong>technological prowess<\/strong> took a significant leap forward at this stage, and that our brains grew to accommodate the changes.

Combined activation of I<sub>h<\/sub> and decrease of a Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> activated K<sup>+<\/sup> current (I<sub>K,Ca<\/sub>) results in depolarization of neuron, which activates another low-threshold Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> spike.

For example, genetic sequencing techniques allowed us to definitively work out the evolutionary relationships among humans, chimps, and gorillas. But this approach can only allow us to back as far as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). LUCA was presumably a DNA-based (uni-)cellular lifeform, given that these characteristcs are shared across the entire tree of life. So we have no phylogenetic information that we can leverage to reconstruct what happened to get us from a soup of organic molecules to LUCA. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that evolutionary biology focuses on what happens to a population in which we have variation, heritability, and selection.

For a crude analogy, think of the brain as an incredibly complex, self-modifying, multithreaded program.

Consciousness would be the abstraction arising from the behavior of one particular thread in the program: a thread which has access to a limited buffer of its own (that thread's) behavior, and control over limited input and output from the body.

Now since LacI's function is to inhibit transcription, thus it is strongly bound to the DNA and I'd say even if a polymerase somehow slips through the polyA signals at the end of the first gene it is likely to be stopped by the LacI already bound at the second promoter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you could put a weak promoter opposing the first gene and drive its expression, so it would collide with the oncoming polymerase from the first gene thus stopping it before reaching the second gene.

Balance is achieved and maintained by a complex set of sensorimotor control systems that include <em>sensory input from vision (sight)<\/em>, proprioception (touch), and the vestibular system (motion, equilibrium, spatial orientation); integration of that sensory input; and motor output to the eye and body muscles. Your vision helps you see where your head and body are in relationship to the world around you and to sense motion between you and your environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Very simply put, <strong>to blindfold someone is to take out the contribution of vision to balance.<\/strong> So, if the other systems involved in balance are off even a bit, blindfolding someone will interfere with their ability to keep their balance, even on two legs, let alone one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are those systems in more detail.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Proprioception<\/strong>. In your joints, muscles, tendons, skin, and other areas, you have proprioceptors, that tell your brain where yoor aody parts (arms, legs, etc) are in relation to self in space. Because we live on a planet with  gravity, even if we are blindfolded, if we are standing correctly, our feet will sent our brain signals that will in turn allow the brain to judge our position in space with regard to gravity and we will keep our feet firmly planted on the ground in a way which will maintain us upright in a constantly regulated position (if we sense less pressure from the bottom of our right great toe, we will adjust by leaning forward and to the right a bit until out=r brain says, \"ok, right there!\" This happens from all the skin and joint proprioceptors responding at the same time. Notice that once vision is blocked, our bodies become relatively very still; we focus on our balance. We move tentatively.<\/p>\n\n<p>As people age, they lose some of their propioceptive abilities. That's one of the reasons for falls in the elderly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inner ear<\/strong>. In our inner ear are the semi-circular canals, three on each side, which are oriented at ~90° to each other so we cover 3 dimensions. In these canals is fluid which sloshes about when we move our heads, change directions, bend over, etc. The fluid moving about is detected by fine hair-like projections on the sensory cells lining the canal called <em>stereocilia<\/em> - like a wave would be detected by your leg in shallow ocean water. These semicircular canals help us to remain oriented in space. Now, the semicircular canals are also attached to <em>otolith organs<\/em> - two chambers which are concerned with gravity. They have fine crystals in them - called otoconia - which move according to our head's position with relationship to \"down\", or gravity.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we stand perfectly still (probably not possible without support), everything is read by the vestibular system (the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs) as normal, and we stay upright (there is a constant communication between our vestibular system and our brain). So, when blindfolded, we can stay upright even if we shake our heads, bend them forward or back, etc (within reason). As we age, things can degenerate in this vestibular system, which affects our balance, and results in more falls in the elderly. (Diseases in the young can also affect this.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vestibulo-ocular Reflex<\/strong>. A complicated system which reflexly coordinated input from your vestibular system and your vision in head movement. If someone suddenly turns your head, your eyes will move in the equal and opposite manner, that is, your eyes will stay focused on the object on which they were focused just before your head was moved. This system is what allows you to easily keep reading something while you shake your head from side to side (not the case if you move the print side to side).<\/p>\n\n<p>When things start going wrong (in a very slow manner) with your vestibular or proprioception systems, your eyes can <em>help compensate<\/em> by orienting you to the horizon, etc., in a manner, correcting for some 'off' calculations in your vestibular system. Vision helps us to identify orientation with respect to gravity, determine direction and speed of movement, etc., to a much lesser degree than the other systems described but enough to have an impact. So, in people whose vision is failing, either their other systems have to be in really good working order (e.g. why young blind people aren't always falling over) or they have problems with falling.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/human-balance-system\">The Human Balance System<\/a> (easy)<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/7895\">Researchers find diminished balance in those with poor vision<\/a> (easy)<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.cbass.com/Balance.htm\">Balance<\/a> (easy)<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engineering.pitt.edu%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D2147497203&amp;ei=G9yEVIusHMHLsASslYG4Cg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEe1Htq6qVrQ_O7d_g8Ri5MTPmPJA&amp;sig2=KtQ6NV4wrEMVBL2L3uTXyw&amp;bvm=bv.80642063,d.aWw\">Visual influences on balance<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bCuHZgwSRC4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=vestibulo+ocular+reflex+and+physiologic+vertigo&amp;ots=A5rMJ0X1Ks&amp;sig=XobkDjkD-jId7DnUhQpBQouCGlc#v=onepage&amp;q=vestibulo%20ocular%20reflex%20and%20physiologic%20vertigo&amp;f=false\">Baloh and Honrubia's Clinical Neurophysiology of the Vestibular System\n By Robert William Baloh, Kevin Kerber, MD<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s2/chapter02.html\">Somatosensory Systems<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://kin450-neurophysiology.wikispaces.com/Vestibular+Occular+Reflex\">Vestibular Occular Reflex<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":24658,"question_id":24640,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24640/effect-of-closed-eyes-on-balance","last_activity_date":1432259520,"creation_date":1417977365,"answer_count":1,"title":"Effect of closed eyes on balance?","body":"<p>Suppose you want to stand on one leg.

According to the ressources I have found, it depends on the place where these minerals are found and also the other minerals present at this place. <\/p>\n\n<p>When there are uranium and or potassium rich ores available, the fossils seem to enrich these radioactive isotopes in the calcium matrix of the bone during fossilation. See the reference for some more details on this.<\/p>\n\n<p>The isotopes which are occurring there are Uranium (U<sup>235<\/sup> and U<sup>238<\/sup>), Potassium (K<sup>40)<\/sup>) and Rubidium (Rb<sup>87<\/sup>), all of them with half lives in the billion years. Carbon does not play a role in these very old fossils (millions of years old), as the half life of the relevant carbon isotope is to short. These elements are also used for radiodating these fossils, see the table below (from <a href=\"http://www.agiweb.org/news/evolution/datingfossilrecord.html\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VhZs5.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the radioactive safety I think there are some fossils where you should be cautious and carry them around all day long in your pocket. Most of these isotopes release $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ radiation, some $\\gamma$. While the $\\alpha$ radiation is relatively easy to shield, lead can have detrimental effects due to the occurance of retardation radiation of the slowed down particles. In the lab we use thick acrylic glass shields to protect us from $\\beta$ radiation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally I have found some secondary sources for painting the dinosaur bones with lead paint, but no real first hand source from a museum or so. Additionally the rules for radiation safety are pretty strict. If the bones would be so radioactive that a short visit would endanger you (how long are you looking at such pieces, a few minutes at maximum I would say) than they couldn't be shown anyway. Let alone the dangers for the scientists which analyze them.

The exception is the mitochondrial genome but that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">is not the genome of a vertebrate<\/a>. So, overall, A and T occur almost 10% more often than C and G. But why does this happen?<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, the reasons are not entirely clear. Some factors that affect this, however, are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The C of the CG dinucleotides can be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation\" rel=\"nofollow\">methytlated<\/a>. Methylation is a chemical modification of the nucleotide and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The regulatory sequences that control the way that genes are expressed (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">promoters<\/a>), are often rich in CG sequences (these localized overrepresentations of CG are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site#CpG_islands\" rel=\"nofollow\">CpG islands<\/a>) which enable the control of the associated gene's expression by the mechanism of methylation (which can \"turn off\" a gene). Not the kind of thing you want to have occurring randomly in your genes. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Methylated Cytosine (C) is often converted to Thymine (T): <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8g6SAm.png\" alt=\"Cytosine becomes Thymine\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This would result in a gradual loss of C in favor of T. This theory had long been considered to be the main reason why CpG is so rare in mammalian genomes, but see the next point.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I found a study from 2004 <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111904000836\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a> that shows that, among other things, there is no correlation between CpG and TpA shortages, suggesting that the deamination of Cytosine to Thymine is not enough to explain the phenomenon. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I should also point out that the fact that Alanine represents  7.8% of all aminoacids in proteins does not say anything at all about the frequency with which its codons appear in the genome at large. Only ~2% of the human genome (genes are ~5% and exons, those parts of genes that are translated into proteins, only ~2%) actually codes for proteins so it is only in that 2% where you will see this overrepresentation (if one exists) of Alanine. <\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, yes, the CpG shortage is a general feature of the human genome and not of chromosome X, but the precise reasons for this are not yet entirely clear (as far as I know, anyway). <\/p>\n\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111904000836\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jabbari K., and Bernardi G., <em>Gene<\/em> <strong>333<\/strong>:143-149, 2004<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":34423,"question_id":34363,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34363/why-arent-genetic-triplets-roughly-evenly-found-in-dna","last_activity_date":1432227950,"creation_date":1432024669,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why aren't genetic triplets roughly evenly found in DNA?","body":"<p>Sorry, the page I linked to is huge and you'll need to do a text search for \"CG\" to find the part I'm talking about.<\/p>\n\n<p>I found a graph on this page (<a href=\"http://www.oftenpaper.net/sierpinski.htm\">http://www.oftenpaper.net/sierpinski.htm<\/a>) showing that the eight DNA sequences including CG, i.e. four *CG and four CG* sequences are much rarer than the others in a human X chromosome.

Consider that the micro-organisms of macro-organisms have developed to form machinery that builds solutions to problems, rather than being retrofitted themselves to counteract new threats. Each time a bacteria needs to adapt itself to attack, whereas the specialized cells of our body can manufacture a solution on the fly rather than waiting around for a random beneficial strait to show up in the population. It would be like a small manufacturer quickly retrofitting it's production system to produce a new product. Sure, it can produce a new product, but it takes time for setup, and the company can only produce a limited number of varied products at a time, whereas a giant production company may have a huge amount of preset equipment for manufacturing a enormous variety of products with no need for retrofitting (evolution). The larger factory could have the advantage when it comes to efficient production, with quicker turnaround. <\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the specialization of micro-organisms leads to nature allowing the evolution of macro-organisms as the major factories of nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Excess, unused (or at least non-critical) DNA is useful because it allows evolution some wiggle room. If a bacteria suffers a deleterious mutation in a vital gene, then it's obviously not fit. But, that same bacterium with can accumulate potentially useful codes in the previously unused portion of it's genome, without needing to deal with risky mutations in vital genes. And again, as microorganisms specialize, they can fabricate new proteins and such, with lower risk, and less time, compared to micro-organisms which use evolution of their genome as the sole/primary means of short term adaption.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31513,"question_id":31512,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1429562667},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1ee6e460265caf3c4324311216405e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15097,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15097/ebrohman","reputation":301,"display_name":"ebrohman"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1429568226,"creation_date":1429568226,"body":"<p>Richard Dawkins discusses this in his book <em>The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Bacteria and other microorganisms, specifically Archaea, are able to exchange in a sort of 'copy and paste' genetic exchange that differs wildly from sexual reproduction.

The cold receptors in the skin respond to the place where evaporation is the highest. Thus the detection of a particular smell is associated with the direction it came from.\n  The rhinarium is adapted for different purposes in different mammals according to ecological niche. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>In aquatic mammals, development of lobes next to the nostrils allow them to be closed for diving. In mammals that root, the rhinarium often develops into a hard pad, with the nostrils off to the side. In the elephants it has become a tactile organ. In the walrus, it is covered with stiff bristles to protect it during foraging for shellfish. In many animals the form and purpose of the rhinarium remains to be elucidated.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially it is the case of having a better sense of smell provided by the extended surface area, which has evolved to fit whatever the organism in question needs. I'll update this when I find this in a few more papers.<\/p>\n\n<p>I took this from the wiki: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinarium\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinarium<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it work ?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A model of the canine nasal airway, developed from a 3-D\n  reconstruction of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n  scans, was used to study the aerodynamics of canine olfaction.\n  Simulation results reveal that a unique olfactory airflow pattern\n  exists within the canine nasal cavity during sniffing that is critical\n  for efficient olfaction. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Calculations show that this novel olfactory airflow pattern provides a\n  crucial residence time for odorant absorption in the sensory region\n  and promotes spatiotemporal fractionation of odorant mixtures along\n  the olfactory epithelium. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>The canine nose functions similar to a chromatograph that imposes\n  odorant-specific deposition patterns upon the thin mucus layer\n  covering the nasal cavity....The results show that deposition patterns\n  are primarily influenced by the intricate olfactory flowfield and the\n  odorant solubility in the mucus layer.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Highly-soluble odorants are quickly absorbed near the entrance to the\n  olfactory region, and thus do not reach the periphery with significant\n  concentrations. In contrast, insoluble odorants are deposited more\n  evenly and may even exit the olfactory region without being completely\n  absorbed. Predicted odorant deposition patterns correspond with the\n  anatomical organization of olfactory receptors known to occur in\n  keen-scented (macrosmatic) mammals, providing a mechanism that helps\n  explain the excellent olfactory acuity of the dog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In short the mucus on a dog's nose 'pre-sorts' smells by trapping the passage of some odour particles more than others along the nose, with different types of molecules being picked up at different \"depths\" in the nasal cavity.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read about it here: <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Craven, Brent, Gary Settles, and Eric Paterson. \"The Aerodynamics and Transport Phenomena of Canine Olfaction.\" APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts.

Or may be it just simplifies cleaning the nose from the previous sniffing act?<\/p>\n","question_id":34386,"tags":["dogs","nose","feline"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":129,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100007279681305/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":15806,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15806/yurihbss","reputation":16,"display_name":"yurihbss"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":2,"post_id":34388,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432113947,"comment_id":55084,"body":"if he is the brother of your grandparent then his DNA has some degree of probability that it is identical by descent to that of your grandparent - siblings on average share half of their DNA, though theoretically could share 0-100% of their DNA.
