Cell division rates are also a factor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Healing is a complex process that involves multiple stages.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The body has to limit the damage that can result from an injury. So, first it tries to stop the bleeding and then a local inflammatory process is triggered. This inflammation will:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>stop pathogens from entering the systemic circulation<\/li>\n<li>'clean' the injured tissue by removing dead cells<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>In order to recreate the tissue, there is the need for blood which will deliver nutrients and other factors. So, fibroblasts and endothelial cells migrate in the wounded area and form temporary tissue and new blood vessels; the new tissue is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue\" rel=\"nofollow\">granulation tissue<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The granulation tissue allows for the formation of definitive tissue. This is the remodelling phase. Depending on the wound, the tissue that grows can either be the same as the original one or be fibrous scar tissue.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Looking at the time required by each of these steps:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>should be the fastest as it relies on blood cells and factors that are already present in blood. Also, the wound itself will stimulate the local production of some cells/factors involved (inflammatory factors, vasodilator, vasoconstrictor factors.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>and 3. depend on the duration of cell-division processes, extracellular matrix formation, and vascularization. Cell division time can be slowed down by a lack of required nutrients and/or substances.  While the granulation tissue forms in almost constant time no matter the injury, the final tissue depends on what type it will be.

The reasons behind this sudden increase in O\u2082 has to do with the development of bark covered wooden plants, a feature made possible by the molecule lignin, which strengthens the trunks of trees and makes tall plants possible. However, lignin was hard for microbes to digest, and the dead trees built up, never returning their carbon to the atmosphere as CO\u2082. So the oxygen they had made while alive stayed in the air <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KbciR.png\" alt=\"Graph of O2 in atmosphere over time\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The plot shows the upper (red) and lower (green) estimates for O\u2082 concentration over time. The data for this plot was taken from a review of analysis of sulfur, carbon, iron, and manganese deposits <a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>. If you're interested in how isotopic analysis can give information about atmospheric oxygen, read that paper, it's detailed.<\/p>\n\n<p>That spike in the plot is the carboniferous. This period in history is interesting because of the appearance of large invertebrates, such as 3 foot wide dragonflies and 6 foot long centipedes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a>. Since these animals move oxygen through a series of tubes called trachea, where air just moves through by diffusion, it was speculated that the higher concentration of oxygen allowed this growth. Recent research indicates that insects can force air through their trachea, and that competition between predators and prey could have explained most of the size <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protodonata\" rel=\"nofollow\">6<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So how does this affect dinosaurs? The carboniferous period was about 350-300 million years ago, which corresponds with the spike on the graph. Dinosaurs appeared in the Triassic, which was about 250-200 million years ago, but oxygen levels were at 16% of the atmosphere at the time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic\" rel=\"nofollow\">7<\/a> ( current O\u2082 levels are about 20% ) If we move into the Jurassic, about 200-150 million years ago, oxygen levels rise to about 26% <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic\" rel=\"nofollow\">8<\/a>. In the Cretaceous, about 150-65 million years ago, O\u2082 was at about 30% <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous\" rel=\"nofollow\">9<\/a>. The O\u2082 percentages are taken from the infoboxes on the right side of the wikipedia articles, which in turn take the number from a plot very similar to the plot I posted here, despite being in German <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">10<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I compiled lists of heaviest and lightest dinosaurs by going through the

Higher oxygen levels in the Jurassic and Cretaceous probably allowed for larger animals to exist, however as time went on Dinosaurs became more diverse in general, including size. Many of them evolved to become smaller, despite being allowed to become larger by higher levels of oxygen. We should also note that even though oxygen levels were still lower than they were during the carboniferous, the animals were much larger, most likely due to their more efficient oxygen transport systems (lungs, 3(4?) chambered hearts, sealed circulatory systems, hemoglobin).<\/p>\n\n<p>If we think about what could drive species to become larger, competition for food and protection from predators comes to mind. Sauropods that could reach the leaves in taller trees had distinct advantages over those who could not. Prey animals stood a better chance at fighting off predators if they were bigger. Likewise, predators could kill larger prey if they became larger too. Oxygen didn't drive them to become larger, it simply allowed them to.<\/p>\n\n<p>To actually answer the question, could the modern atmosphere support animals as large as dinosaurs? It probably could. The heaviest living animal today is the blue whale, at an average mass of 110 metric tons, is heavier than all but 1 of the sauropods on the list I compiled. The heaviest land animal living today is the African Elephant, with average mass of 4.9 metric tons and as high as 10 metric tons, would be a respectable competitor with many of the dinosaur groups I listed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_organisms\" rel=\"nofollow\">12<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another interesting question is not how oxygen affected the size of organisms, but how it affects it their metabolism. Cold blooded animals don't need as much oxygen because they don't spend as much energy. Warm blooded animals must constantly expend energy to maintain body heat, and this requires greater consumption of oxygen. Obviously being large and warm blooded would force you to need even greater levels of oxygen than 1 or the other. It may be that the advantages of being warm blooded outweighed the advantages of large size, but I don't want to dig into that question right now.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20677,"question_id":20656,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1412873660}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20656/what-are-the-atmospheric-requirements-for-large-dinosaurs","last_activity_date":1412873660,"creation_date":1408621145,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are the atmospheric requirements for large dinosaurs?","body":"<p>What are the atmospheric requirements for large dinosaurs? and are the atmospheric constituents for supporting large dinosaurs any different from the atmosphere today?<\/p>\n","question_id":20656,"tags":["evolution","anatomy"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":506,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1408636293},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1032496146/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":6812,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6812/user6812","reputation":25,"display_name":"user6812"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":0,"post_id":17579,"edited":false,"creation_date":1400792037,"comment_id":24062,"body":"It might be best if you draw a diagram of your proposed pathway and post it in your question as an edit so that it&#39;s easier to follow through your question."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1032496146/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":6812,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6812/user6812","reputation":25,"display_name":"user6812"},"score":0,"post_id":17579,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1400793003,"comment_id":24063,"body":"I have a few pictures about it I can post eventually.

The synthesis process involves two -SH groups: one is the terminal group of the pantothenate of the acyl carrier protein domain (Pan-SH) and the other is an -SH group of the condensing enzyme (CE-SH). <\/p>\n\n<p>For the first condensation step the initiating acetyl group is attached to the CE-SH of one monomer and the incoming unit (malonyl CoA) is attached to the Pan-SH of the other monomer. <\/p>\n\n<p>The condensation reaction between these two results in the new elongated unit being attached to the Pan-SH. This unit then goes through the reductase/dehydratase/reductase steps to form the new acyl CoA which is finally transferred to an CE-SH group, opening up the Pan-SH for the next incoming malonyl CoA.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will happen repeatedly in each cycle of the process. Obviously since each monomer has both -SH groups a single fatty acid synthase dimer can be engaged in two elongations at the same time, but these will always include a transfer. It is thought that the initiating acetyl group comes in via the Pan-SH group.<\/p>\n\n<p>You say:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And after that the acetoacetylACP will be swept back to the other monomere (to the reduction part), is this also right?\n  Then the reduction-dehydration-reduction steps are happening and at the end of the road you will get butyrylACP which will cut off from the ACP and migrate on the same monomere to the cysteïnresidu at the condensing enzyme (CE) (= translocation).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The diagram that you included clearly shows that the acetoacetyl group is formed via the reduction-dehydration-reduction steps on the same Pan-SH where its precursor was formed by condensation.

Inactivity of the monomeric form has long been attributed to the obligatory participation of domains from both subunits in catalysis of substrate loading and condensation reactions. However, we have engineered a fatty acid synthase containing one wild-type subunit and one subunit compromised by mutations in all seven functional domains that is active in fatty acid synthesis. This finding indicates that a single subunit, in the context of a dimer, is able to catalyze the entire biosynthetic pathway and suggests that, in the natural complex, each of the two subunits forms a scaffold that optimizes the conformation of the companion subunit.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":17587,"question_id":17579,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17579/fatty-acid-synthesis","last_activity_date":1412873317,"creation_date":1400789353,"answer_count":1,"title":"Fatty Acid Synthesis","body":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UVyic.png\" alt=\"picture 1 (left upper corner) is the FAS or fatty acid synthase.

At sea level, air contains about 20% oxygen so the volume of oxygen in the jar is about 0.0709 liters.<\/p>\n\n<p>At altitudes which are considered high for humans (17000 feet or higher) the percentage of oxygen falls to about 15%. If a bee is able to get 2400 $ \\mu l$ of oxygen per hour from a jar, the volume of oxygen will fall to about 13% after ten hours.$^2$   <\/p>\n\n<p>Based on oxygen consumption alone I think a bee would be stressed at this level, especially at temperatures exceeding 32C. I would guess the bee would be stressed well before this, maybe after 5 hours (16.6% oxygen). If we factor in the likelihood that the bee's respiration is up due to the agitation of confinement I think we can shave another hour off. <\/p>\n\n<p>Depending on the age, size, species, variety, temperature, location, etc. I think an outside limit of 4 hours in an airtight jar is a good guess. <\/p>\n\n<p>Toxicity from CO$_2$ may be a problem but bees have a much higher tolerance for CO$_2$ than humans, according to one set of <a href=\"https://insects.tamu.edu/continuing_ed/bee_biology/lectures/password/Internal_Anatomy_of_Honey_Bees_PN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">entomology notes<\/a>. At 0.04% the concentration will only increase marginally due to a drop in oxygen alone but the bee itself will produce CO$_2$ and in far greater quantities under stress. A chart <a href=\"http://www.coloss.org/beebook/I/physiology/6/1/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> shows production of CO$_2$ in reaction to a light being turned on. 400 ppm is 0.04% but in this case it is due to the bee. If the bee during respiration returns CO$_2$ as quickly as it consumes oxygen the jar could reach 7% CO$_2$ in four hours, a level that may be toxic for humans. But we have already suggested the bee is under stress from oxygen depletion at that point. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many assumptions in this note. A conservative estimate might be an hour in an airtight jar. I would not bet on more. There are probably other issues I haven't thought of. Bees are very fragile and the chart linked above suggests they would not fare will in such an environment.  <\/p>\n\n<p>$^1$ Respiration of Worker Honeybees of Different Ages and at Different Temperatures, Allen, 1958, J. Experimental Biology 36, 92-101. At page 97 Allen gives a chart showing log $\\mu l$ $O_2$/mg body weight/hr. For a 14-23 day old bee at 32C he appears to give about .5 which means 1.65/mg/hr or about 115 $\\mu l$ per hour for a 70mg bee. It may be a typo or perhaps I am misreading the chart.

The hypothetical situation you described in your question demonstrates the necessity of such regulation. The cell cannot allow levels of ATP and NADPH to drop too low because those two factors are required for everything. So if you let the Calvin Cycle run when there is no means of fueling it (ultimately) from light energy, then the Calvin Cycle will run until ATP/NADPH is too low to sustain it further, at which point the cell dies. So several key enzymes in the Calvin cycle are activated indirectly by light. <\/p>\n\n<p>One of the most well-studied regulatory mechanisms is the ferrodoxin/thioredoxin regulatory system. The enzyme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferredoxin-thioredoxin_reductase\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin reductase<\/a> takes electrons from ferredoxin (which is reduced by light energy via the photosystems) and transfers it to thioredoxin, a disulfide-based redox protein. Then thioredoxin reduces several key enzymes in the Calvin Cycle, which activates them (through conformational changes induced by disulfide bonds). The upshot is that when light is around to facilitate reduction, the metabolic enzymes of the Calvin cycle can work, but in the dark the cell oxidizes and these enzymes are turned off, switching off the Calvin cycle and arresting CO$_2$ fixation.<\/p>\n\n<p>An orthogonal direction of light regulation of the \"light-independent\" reactions is <a href=\"http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?id=81\" rel=\"nofollow\">RuBisCO Activase<\/a>, which is required to modify the RuBisCO active site to be active. This requires ATP hydrolysis, which amplifies the sensitivity of the Calvin Cycle to ATP availability. <\/p>\n\n<p>The takeaway is the light-independent reactions may not directly require light as an input, but they are regulated by light availability. I tried to look up how much time in the dark would be required to shift the redox balance such that the Calvin Cycle enzymes would be inactivated, but I couldn't find that data.

Organisms with lungs, gills, or other modified respiratory organs can actively pump the oxygen-containing medium (usually air or water) across their respiratory surface, and some also pump their blood across in the opposite direction to cause a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countercurrent_exchange\" rel=\"nofollow\">countercurrent exchange<\/a> to enable maximum efficiency of oxygen/CO\u2082 transfer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tracheal system is a more efficient mode of gas exchange than diffusion since it does not only involve the oxygen passing over the organism's body surface (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-permeable_membrane\" rel=\"nofollow\">semi-permeable membrane<\/a>) which limits the rate of movement. Instead the epidermis is invaginated to form tracheae (tubes) through which air can travel passively. The tracheal system is highly branched and terminates at tracheoles (fluid-filled sacs) which closely line respiring tissues to provide oxygen and allow release of CO\u2082.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tracheal respiration limits the size of insects since their oxygen demands will not be able to be met if the air has to diffuse very far. Some insects require more oxygen than others: many larger insects and more active insects have evolved to supplement the tracheal system with pumps, gas gills (permanent or temporary bubbles of air which aquatic insects carry), or mechanically ventilated air sacs (honeybees have these, see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Insects-An-Outline-Entomology/dp/1444330365/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340808083&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gullan &amp; Cranston, 2005<\/a>; and Snodgrass, 1956). <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, tracheal systems can be 'open', 'closed', or the insect can engage in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_gas_exchange\" rel=\"nofollow\">discontinuous gas exchange<\/a>. Insects with open tracheal systems have spiracles (holes in their cuticle). Closed tracheal systems are more common in aquatic insects, they come in two major designs: highly branched systems over the internal surface, allowing cutaneous gas exchange; and filamentous or lamellate  arrangements, which are analogous to a primitive gill (see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/THE-LIFE-OF-INSECTS-Wigglesworth/dp/B0006AYOQK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340808693&amp;sr=8-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wigglesworth, 1964<\/a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Insects-An-Outline-Entomology/dp/1444330365/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340808812&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gullan &amp; Cranston, 2005<\/a> chapter 10 for more on aquatic insect adaptations).

While all plants convert CO\u2082 and H\u2082O to glucose and oxygen, there are at least three pathways that are used to do it. The C3 pathway is older and less efficient than the CAM and C4 pathways. Many drought tolerant plants use the CAM or C4 pathways because less water is needed. The C4 pathway is better than C3 in drier climates, hotter climates, and when CO\u2082 or nitrogen are limited. The hard part about this answer is that I'm not a botanist. Wikipedia lists some plants that use C4, CAM, and C3, but there is no comprehensive list, so I can't match up all the plants you mentioned in your question. In general, a higher percentage of monocots, especially grasses, use C4, but a wider diversity of dicots use C4. But you still can't draw conclusions about families of plants, because while corn and sorghum use C4, rice and barley use C3. Ragweed, a plant you say grows well in dry conditions, is a member of Asteraceae, which includes many plants that use C4. However, rudbeckias are also members of Asteraceae, but don't do as well in dry conditions.

The light-dependent reactions use energy from captured photons to generate ATP and NADPH, with the generation of O<sub>2<\/sub>.

Basically what these plants do is to only open their stomata at night, capturing CO<sub>2<\/sub> in the form of organic acids (oxaloacetate, malate, maleate) which are stored in vacuoles.

This would basically be a cell. And a cell would remain a cell unless combining with other cells and specializing in functionality would have a certain benefit. Check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6QYDdgP9eg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this educational video on abiogenesis<\/a> by cdk007, based on Jack Szostak's work.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, you know that evolution isn't the process of change of all individuals of a species in a single direction, towards another species. It's a process of forking. So, basic cells of species A could evolve into single cells of species B, but that would only mean the extinction of A if the new environment with the new organisms becomes hostile, if resources are scarce, if species A is less adapted than everyone else, so everyone else occupies A's niche.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, when multicellular organisms evolve, there are A LOT of monocellular organisms already present and occupying important niches. All available sources of energy are being used. If something isn't used - it's a new niche for any accidental mutation that enables the organism to use that niche and prosper as a new species. So anyway you look at it, multicellular organisms won't start existing without single cell organisms surrounding them. So all multicellular organisms will have an environment that includes these \"bacteria\", so they will adapt to this environment. It's easier to learn to live with something rather than learning to fight with them and then occupy their niche, because the killing and changing to occupy the niche requires much more changes in the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>Life on earth is balanced, such as each species occupies its important place in the circulation of substances.

In order to properly answer your question, I'll provide some background about photosynthesis itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photosynthesis evolved in a high-CO\u2082 atmosphere, before the oxygen-enrichment of the atmosphere (which actually happened as a result of photosynthesis). Most plant species operate <strong>C3 photosynthesis<\/strong>. In these plants, carbon dioxide diffuses into the cell where it is fixed by <strong>Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO)<\/strong> into a 3-carbon molecule (hence C3), which is then polymerised to make sugars. A crucial fact about RuBisCO is that it has both carboxylase (carbon-fixing) activity and oxygenase (oxygen-fixing) activity. This means that oxygen and carbon dioxide compete for the active site on the enzyme complex, leading to RuBisCO being quite inefficient and slow at fixing carbon in higher oxygen concentrations. That didn't matter in the high-CO\u2082 atmosphere of the early Earth, but in todays atmosphere O\u2082 concentrations are high enough that they severely limit the productivity of C3 plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, plants haven't just been growing slowly all that time - several mechanisms for increasing photosynthetic efficiency have evolved. The most influential systems involve concentrating carbon dioxide in a particular area, excluding oxygen, and concentrating RuBisCO in that same area. This avoids the oxygen competition for the active site and allows RuBisCO to operate more efficiently. The key adaptation here is <strong>C4 photosynthesis<\/strong> - the system which is present in most grasses and many of the most productive plants on Earth (e.g. maize, sugarcane, Miscanthus). It has evolved at least 62 times independently. It works by having RuBisCO concentrated within 'bundle sheath' cells which are surrounded by a layer of suberin wax. This layer prevents CO\u2082 escaping and O\u2082 from getting in. CO\u2082 from the atmosphere is then fixed in different cells - 'mesophyll cells' - by another enzyme - <strong>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)<\/strong>, resulting in a four-carbon molecule (hence C4). This 4-carbon acid, (malate or oxaloacetate depending on the system) is then shuttled into the bundle sheath cells. There, the CO\u2082 is released again by a variety of enzymes depending on the system, creating a high CO\u2082 concentration in the cell where RuBisCO can then work efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, C4 plants are much (about 50%) more efficient than their C3 counterparts, and they are particularly well adapted to high temperatures and moist environments. So, to answer your first question: as atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, C3 plants will gradually be able to photosynthesise more efficiently. Interestingly though, C4 plants are predicted to also benefit from increased atmospheric CO\u2082. If global temperatures rise as predicted, both C3 and C4 plants will be able to operate more efficiently than they currently do, up to a maximum temperature beyond which enzymes will begin to denature faster and efficiency will drop. One consideration is that the difference in efficiency between C3 and C4 systems will decrease, which may significantly alter the makeup of plant communities around the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a vast oversimplification, but it is accurate for the predicted overall effects. Localised effects (i.e. productivity changes in a particular region or for a particular crop) will depend on habitat, physiology, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some key papers to launch you into the literature: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leakey, A.D.B., Bernacchi, C.J., Dohleman, F.G., Ort, D.R. &amp; Long, S.P.

For example, herbaceous species saw less enhancement of assimilation (due to a decrease in leaf N) compared to woody plants at some sites.<\/li>\n<li>At the ecosystem level, primary production is often limited by factors other than available CO<sub>2<\/sub> - nitrogen or water for example.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are a couple of excellent reviews available:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Nowak, R.

To summarize:- <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The energy requirement of the organism in both the condition remains more or less\n  constant. Since aerobic respiration generates more energy per glucose,(38ATP)\n  it takes more time for the same concentration of the glucose to be\n  depleted, than it takes in the case of anaerobic respiration where\n  less energy is released.(2ATP)  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The non-linearity in case of anaerobic respiration can probably be explained thus:-<br>\nIn the aerobic case, glucose is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide, both of which do not influence the respiratory process. The first step of glycolysis, the phosphorylation of glucose has a very negative free energy change, i.e. is practically irreversible. Therefore a dip in glucose concentration will not affect the rate of energy release and therefore the rate of energy released will stay constant resulting in a linear graph. But in the anaerobic case, the final product is un-metabolised ethyl alcohol. The conversion of pyruvic acid formed as a result of glycolysis to ethyl alcohol is not so strongly irreversible(smaller free energy change), and at high product concentrations, becomes considerably reversible. This means that the ethyl alcohol produced will affect the rate of glucose metabolism, and will retard it by negative feedback (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Le chatelier's principle<\/a>). This will lower the speed of glucose utilisation at low concentrations of glucose, i.e. high concentrations of ethyl alcohol. This reduce the value of slope at lower concentrations of glucose in the graph, and hence produces the non-linearity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14457,"question_id":14327,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14327/aerobic-vs-anaerobic-respiration-comparison","last_activity_date":1412865533,"creation_date":1389129297,"answer_count":3,"title":"Aerobic vs anaerobic respiration comparison","body":"<p>The following graphs compare glucose decomposition in yeasts (in anaerobic vs aerobic conditions respectively)<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is, why doesn't the first one look like a straight line as the second one does?

Because they strike so rapidly, they generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow.

Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to increase even further. \nCa2+ now binds to troponin C, tropomyosin is moved out of the way, and the interaction of actin and myosin can occur. \nActin and myosin bind, cross-bridges form and then break, the thin and thick filaments move past each other, and tension is produced. \nCross-bridge cycling continues as long as intracellular Ca2+ concentration is high enough to occupy the Ca2+-binding sites on troponin C.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/li>\n<li><ol start=\"5\">\n<li>A critically important concept is that the magnitude of the tension developed by myocardial cells is proportional to the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. \nTherefore, it is reasonable that hormones, neurotransmitters, and drugs that alter the inward Ca2+ current during the action potential plateau or that alter sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores would be expected to change the amount of tension produced by myocardial cells.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I like this figure about the topic in summarising stimuli in the smooth muscle:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X18Ap.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In heart<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sZYQY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In the gastrointestinal tract, we have then again special cells, <strong>Cajal cells<\/strong>, that work as \"pacemakers\" of the GI tract. \nMyenteric Interstitial cells of Cajal [ICC-MY] serve as a pacemaker which creates the bioelectrical slow wave potential that leads to contraction of the smooth muscle.\nThis activity differs along the length of the system<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3 per minute in the stomach <\/li>\n<li>11-12 per minute in the duodenum <\/li>\n<li>9-10 per minute in the ileum <\/li>\n<li>3-4 per minute in the colon<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You can see them as to work analogously through the \"all-or-none\" principle.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Costanzo, Physiology<\/li>\n<li>Pocock, Physiology<\/li>\n<li>My notes during during years 2011-2014 (in three Physiology courses and research)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":21953,"question_id":21948,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1412789236}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21948/all-or-nothing-phenomena","last_activity_date":1412789236,"creation_date":1412740352,"answer_count":1,"title":"All or nothing phenomena","body":"<p>We know that an action potential is produced by an active cell membrane when the stimulus reaches a certain threshold.

Of course the nervous systems <em>is<\/em> a single network of neurons, but that doesn't stop it from having separate components.<\/p>\n\n<p>One can indeed often simplify neural pathways as \"IN (sensory) ===> (black box with decision-making magic) ===> OUT (motor)\"<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reflexes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Reflex arcs are a great way of demonstrating this separation because they do not involve the more complicated integration of the brain. Let's take the knee-bend (patellar) reflex as an example: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_reflex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_reflex<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3RwyP.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The diagram is correct in concept but let me add the anatomical detail to illustrate how sensory and motor pathways are separate, yet connected: When the reflex is triggered, the signal travels up from the sensory neuron ends located under the knee cap (these are dendrites) to the sensory neuron's body in the spinal chord. The sensory cell relays the signal via its axon, which then synapses with a motor neuron's body also in the spinal chord. The motor neuron then sends a motor impulse via its axon back down to the leg, where it triggers muscle contraction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Physically, in this case there will be a separation also in nerves (at least if I may trust Wikipedia for now), where the sensory reflex neurons' dendrites travel from the leg to the spinal chord through an afferent nerve and the motor neurons' axons travel in the reverse direction through an efferent nerve. The only physical and conceptual connection between the sensory pathway and the motor pathway is the synapse between the sensory and the motor neurons in the spinal chord.<\/p>\n\n<p>More complex sensorimotor pathways might include interneurons or integration with various circuits in the brain, but it is usually possible to define discreet separate parts of the pathway, one sensory and one motor, with the only connection being those interneurons.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sensory and motor separation in the CNS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The central nervous system (CNS, which includes the brain and the spinal chord) is actually surprisingly organised in this regard, with quite strict separation of motor and sensory pathway components. For example, the cortex of the brain has distinct regions which contain sensory neurons for evaluation of various types of peripheral skin sensation. Separate from these are regions which contain motor neurons for movement of skeletal (voluntary-control) muscle. The interaction of these is of course more complex given that it involves skin sensation and conscious decision making in regards to movement.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8IaMh.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the spinal chord is structured into sensory and motor regions. In summary, the spinal chord consists of: 1) cell bodies (motor, sensory, inter; grey in the picture), 2) ascending axons (blue), 3) descending axons (red). Similar to nerves, axons going up or down the spinal chord are bundled into \"tracts\". Sensory axons are never bundled with motor axons, making it possible to create a map of the spinal chord in cross-section.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tracts' names might be a bit confusing at first, but on second look are actually pretty self-explanatory. They usually contain where the axons come from and where they are going in order to synapse with other neurons. E.g. the spinocerebellar tract is formed of axons coming from the spine and going to the cerebellum. Given that the cerebellum is near the brain and the spine is further down, this is obviously an ascending tract - and ascending tracts are always sensory (because sensory information never needs to be carried downwards due to the brain being at the top).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4HZru.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Where it gets blurry<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The sensory/motor separation isn't always as clear as I've described above. In fact, nerves (bundles of axons anywhere in the body outside of the CNS) will usually contain both sensory and motor pipelines. In particular, the cranial nerves (12 of the most important nerves) all include sensory and motor components for the respective part of the body that they manage. E.g. the facial nerve contains both the sensory connections for parts of the tongue and the motor connections that control facial muscles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another more complex example is pain sensation, where interneurons in the spinal chord can feed back onto sensory neurons and inhibit their signals, or axons can inhibit those packed in the same nerve bundle simply due to electrical effects.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21957,"question_id":21952,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1412774198}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21952/can-the-sensory-neuron-network-and-the-motor-neuron-network-be-considered-separa","last_activity_date":1412774198,"creation_date":1412764730,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can the sensory neuron network and the motor neuron network be considered separate networks?","body":"<p>I am reading up on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">nervous system<\/a> using wikipedia and trying to interpret one infographic on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system#mediaviewer/File:Nervous_system_organization_en.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/laIw3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\nI've always thought of the human nervous system as a singular network of neurons.

An antigen is a molecule that also induces an immune response in the body.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, not only is the blood important here but also the plasma. The plasma contains antibodies. Antibodies are (according to wikipedia)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a large Y-shape protein produced by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Members of the A group have B antibodies in their plasma, members of the B group have A antibodies in their plasma, AB has neither, and O has both.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now taking this all into account and to answer your question, if B blood is given to a patient of type A, the antigens on the surface of the A blood cells would react as if the incoming B blood cells are foreign, harmful substances. To from the book \"Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens\"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2265/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If incompatible blood is given in a transfusion, the donor cells are treated as if they were foreign invaders, and the patient's immune system attacks them accordingly.\n  Not only is the blood transfusion rendered useless, but a potentially massive activation of the immune system and clotting system can cause shock, kidney failure, circulatory collapse, and death.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The same would result if A blood is given to a B blood type patient, the B blood cells would initiate an immune response to the A blood cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>To further expand on your question, this is why O is the universal donor. There are no antigens on its surface that will illicit an immune response from other blood groups. It also has both A and B antibodies in its plasma. Similarly, AB is the universal recipient. It has both antigens on its surface meaning that neither A nor B antigens will illicit an immune response from other blood groups.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21919,"question_id":21847,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21847/what-happens-when-you-mix-type-a-with-type-b-blood-and-v-v","last_activity_date":1412652378,"creation_date":1412361470,"answer_count":2,"title":"What happens when you mix type A with type B blood (and v.v)","body":"<p>What happens when you mix different blood types that are not compatible? <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, if a patient has type A blood and receives type B blood, or v.v.? <\/p>\n","question_id":21847,"tags":["hematology","blood-circulation","red-blood-cell","antigen","transfusion"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":5725,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/496373f8bcd1048444405659033aee7f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":9640,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9640/mmj","reputation":16,"display_name":"mmj"},"answers":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user9474"},"score":8,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1412393521,"creation_date":1412393521,"body":"<p>The saying that you are referring to is from Carl Sagan, when he stated that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We are a way for the universe to know itself.

You'll notice that Li, Be, and B are rare, and C, N, and O are fairly common, and are the main components in biological chemistry. Fe is relatively abundant, and after Fe elemental abundance falls off. The explanation for the abundances comes from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis#The_major_types_of_nucleosynthesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">processes involved in nucleosynthesis<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Big bang nucleosynthesis was the generation of hydrogen and helium within the first 3 minutes of the universe as the quark-gluon plasma cooled and formed the protons and neutrons. As the universe expanded and cooled, it lost the energy needed to keep making atoms within 20 minutes, so only very small amounts of Li, Be, and B could be made.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stellar nucleosynthesis is the creation of \"heavy\" elements by nuclear fusion in stars. This is how we get C through Fe. As the stars age and use up their fuel, they generate elements up to Fe because energy can be released from fusion of atoms up to iron, past iron fusion takes more energy than can be released.<\/p>\n\n<p>Elements heavier than Fe must be created through supernova explosions. This is the only natural way to get enough energy to jam the nuclei together. This only works well for elements up to uranium, where nuclei become unstable and decay at relatively fast rates. These unstable elements are produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. Note that supernova explosions don't just make heavier elements, they are also responsible for blasting the elements made in stars into space where they can form new stars and planets. This is where the matter that makes us comes from, hence the stardust.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another method for generating light atoms is cosmic spallation, where a cosmic ray hits an atom and blows some protons and neutrons out of the nucleus. This material becomes light atoms, such as Li, Be, and B.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a periodic table that shows where each element comes from.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xzmei.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":21917,"question_id":21853,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21853/stardust-or-the-elements-in-our-bodies","last_activity_date":1412650786,"creation_date":1412381060,"answer_count":3,"title":"Stardust or the elements in our bodies","body":"<p>How do we know we are made of stardust?

In this lineage individuals undergo some torsion during their development. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropoda\" rel=\"nofollow\">This<\/a> wikipedia articles say:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Snails are distinguished by an anatomical process known as torsion, where the visceral mass of the animal rotates 180° to one side during development, such that the anus is situated more or less above the head. This process is unrelated to the coiling of the shell, which is a separate phenomenon. Torsion is present in all gastropods, but the opisthobranch gastropods are secondarily detorted to various degrees.[13][14]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Torsion occurs in two mechanistic stages. The first is muscular and the second is mutagenetic. The effects of torsion are primarily physiological - the organism develops an asymmetrical nature with the majority of growth occurring on the left side. This leads to the loss of right-paired appendages (e.g., ctenidia (comb-like respiratory apparatus), gonads, nephridia, etc.). Furthermore, the anus becomes redirected to the same space as the head. This is speculated to have some evolutionary function, as prior to torsion, when retracting into the shell, first the posterior end would get pulled in, and then the anterior. Now, the front can be retracted more easily, perhaps suggesting a defensive purpose.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>However, this \"rotation hypothesis\" is being challenged by the \"asymmetry hypothesis\" in which the gastropod mantle cavity originated from one side only of a bilateral set of mantle cavities.[15]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Gastropods typically have a well-defined head with two or four sensory tentacles with eyes, and a ventral foot, which gives them their name (Greek gaster, stomach, and poda, feet). The foremost division of the foot is called the propodium. Its function is to push away sediment as the snail crawls. The larval shell of a gastropod is called a protoconch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can find more information <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(gastropod)\" rel=\"nofollow\">there<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":21907,"question_id":21906,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1412641028}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21906/whats-the-evolutionary-reason-behind-decussation","last_activity_date":1412641028,"creation_date":1412626717,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's the evolutionary reason behind decussation?","body":"<p>A bunch of stuff in the human nervous system decussates.

So-called\n  \u201cDe novo computational discovery\u201d is perhaps the most popular, where\n  given only a set of DNA sequences, an algorithm is used to identify\n  candidate shared motifs. This can be thought of as the task of finding\n  a set of non- overlapping, approximately matching substrings given a\n  starting set of strings. This is a very difficult problem.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>From a more general perspective, DNA sequence analysis is often done\n  using DNA sequence motifs. It is reasonable to ask the question - what\n  makes a sequence a motif? From a biological perspective, a motif is\n  simply the smallest identifiable sequence sub- component of something\n  larger.  This subcomponent can be thought of as the smallest\n  identifiable piece of functionality related to the underlying biology,\n  Therefore, sequence analysis often focuses on identifying these\n  motifs. However, these motifs are typically very short, so analyzing a\n  set of DNA sequences with biological significance solely by focusing\n  on the motifs contained within them potentially discards valuable\n  information, for example, possible long-range correlelations between\n  nucleotide positions in the sequences.  Note also that the statistical\n  methods used to identify motifs are typically Markovian, like Hidden\n  Markov Models (HMM), which are naturally tailored towards looking at\n  small sequences.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>An alternative, and possibly complementary approach, is to consider a\n  sequence as a single unit, and try to do direct statistical analysis\n  on it. This approach is less often used. One reason is that such\n  sequences can quickly grow too large, and are not well suited to\n  Markovian approaches. This approach is used in this paper, which does\n  not use Markovian techniques. Instead, it tries to model correlation\n  structure across the sequence.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We do this by fitting a suitable Bayesian model to that set using\n  Bayesian model selection. As noted above, our major rationale for this\n  model is the assumption that the nucleotide locations of this set are\n  correlated among themselves. With this assumption in mind, we\n  construct a family of probability distributions to capture this\n  correlation information, described in Subsection 2.1.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","question_id":16367,"tags":["bioinformatics","sequence-analysis","publishing"],"score":9,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":169,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1396774661},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100003301550273/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":5700,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5700/user4147","reputation":856,"display_name":"user4147","accept_rate":56},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f3a0a804806add325c4ea496c6efabe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8179,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8179/rickardsjogren","reputation":322,"display_name":"RickardSjogren"},"score":18,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2180b1a962bf46e58fa9746cb4ebfb91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8224,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8224/pete-kirkham","reputation":131,"display_name":"Pete Kirkham"},"score":7,"post_id":19473,"edited":false,"creation_date":1404519810,"comment_id":27809,"body":"Most people can see a bright torch (flashlight in US English) or desk lamp through their hand, which is a good deal thicker than eyelids.

For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)<\/a> has been shown to be nearly ubiquitous by <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=512921\" rel=\"nofollow\">age two<\/a>.  I actually disagree with the Wiki article on the common cold which puts <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">coronaviruses<\/a> (plural, which is not clear in the article) in second place.  For example, if you take look at <a href=\"http://www.choa.org/Menus/Documents/Flu/Virometer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">sessional reports from hospitals<\/a>, you can find that RSV and influenza are the more common.  Now this does select for those who were sick enough to seek hospital treatment, but if you look at a recent more <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jrm/2014/469393/\" rel=\"nofollow\">in-depth study<\/a> conducted through health clinics, you will again find coronavirus in much lower showing:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qebl7.jpg\" alt=\"Table of PCR results seeking viral RNA from nasopharyngeal samples\"><\/p>\n\n<p>[Editorial note, if someone wants to take the time to MathJax that table in, please go ahead.  It seemed too large to insert the table as text. <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jrm/2014/469393/tab1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here\u2019s the original<\/a>.]<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, a cold is an infection from any of the above viruses, with a common cold likely being HRV or RSV.  But how the body reacts to each of those is different.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Secondly, how do we mount an immune response to a cold?<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are two different kinds of immune responses in humans: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">innate<\/a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive<\/a>. (to not get to technical, you can come up with responses outside of these).  Both responses are excitingly complex, and needed to fight a cold.  The innate immune system is designed to handle the initial reactions to the pathogens, but often the adaptive immune system is what \"clears\" (viral clearance being the removal of the infection) the infection totally.  In a novel infection, the adaptive immune system takes a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25210145\" rel=\"nofollow\">few days to ramp up<\/a>, which is why a cold can last for a few days to two weeks. This is when you get <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">B-cells<\/a> producing enough antibody to clear the infection.  Then the next time you are infected by something of the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">serotype<\/a> you will have a reservoir of cells already primed to make an immune response, and it will happen quicker.  At least that is what the human body is trying to do.  Viruses are trying to \"evade\" the immune system and proliferate (acknowledging of course that is a personification of viruses, and that they are not \"trying\" to do anything). <\/p>\n\n<p>The key word in the adaptive response is \"novel.\"  If the pathogen is different enough, that is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope\" rel=\"nofollow\">epitopes<\/a> are different enough, then the immune system won't recognize it.  This is the principal strategy used by HRV.  Depending on who you ask there are between 96-120 serotypes of HRV, so using a number of about 100 seems reasonable (120 is a much more recent number and the increase has largely correlated with better diagnostic tools).  There don't seem to be additional stereotypes developing/mutating quickly (though conceivably they could), so as opposed to being infected by a mutated version of the cold you had last year, you're getting a different strain/serotype that was already in circulation.  Thus if you got a different HRV infection once a year, you have about 100 years of rihno viruses colds (when you actually get that old you have senescence problems in the immune system).<\/p>\n\n<p>RSV is a different story.  You don't mount a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362689\" rel=\"nofollow\">lasting immune response<\/a> to the virus in the first place:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YDsiG.png\" alt=\"Humoral Response to Acute Viral Infection in Humans\"> (Table 10.6.  <em>Fields Virology<\/em>; 6th Edition.  LWW 2013)<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, I know a researcher who would infect his lab members with the exact same strain of RSV every 6 months for years (before people would stop such a thing...).  Why RSV doesn't elicit lasting immunity--and in fact notably shorter immunity--is the subject of current research.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see in Table 10.6, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosal_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">mucsal responses<\/a> are generally not as long lasting as systemic infections.  This can make since from a macro view, the mucus successfully prevented the pathogen from spreading to the rest of the tissues in the body, so it's not as critical to respond to.  On a more specific level we know that more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">IgA<\/a> is produced and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine\" rel=\"nofollow\">cytokines<\/a> can be <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0300-9475.2004.01382.x/abstract;jsessionid=18A0FB4ACC19FF265B744A1B04734309.f03t02\" rel=\"nofollow\">different<\/a>.  But RSV seems specifically reduced. One leading idea is that two of the proteins produced by the virus, NS1 and NS2, cause an immune response to not be properly mounted.  In other words, the virus is making materials that deliberately interfere with adaptive immune response.  <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249281\" rel=\"nofollow\">An interesting paper<\/a> that just came out addresses this idea for a possible vaccine candidate.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21802,"question_id":21507,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1412477142}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold","last_activity_date":1412477142,"creation_date":1411277059,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why don't we develop immunity against common cold?","body":"<p>We all suffer from common cold, and that, frequently.

Let me try to address a few of them as I don't think I am qualified to answer them all but hopefully I can get this thread started. I am a graduate student in the biophysical chemistry field and have been following a little bit of the Crispr Cas9 craze in the last couple of years. So I am not an expert on Cas9 by any means but I do find it interesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many speculate that as long as their have been cellular life, viruses or some obligate parasites have existed as well. This stems from the idea that viruses perhaps are not \"non-self\" but rather are parts of the host that happen to become inanimate particles that escape the cell and then find another suitable host. Some viruses have co-evolved with the host, perhaps to prevent other viruses from invading its \"home/birth mother\". Again, much of this paragraph is just speculation, but it is likely that CRISPR systems, or an adaptive immune systems like it have existed as long as viruses/obligate parasites have. <\/p>\n\n<p>Error rates, you can look at some of the papers that have come out recently but the idea is that there are a lot of error rates, especially if the RNA is constitutively transcribed from a plasmid. Some people have suggested delivering, not the plasmids for the guide RNAs and the Cas9 protein, but instead, the Cas9 protein complexed to the RNA itself. Other ways to control the amount you deliver to a cell include delivering the RNA for the Cas9 protein so it is eventually degraded. This avoids the complication of delivering DNA which can be transcribed multiple times potentially flooding your cell with cas9 protein or guide RNAs, increasing the likelihood of off target effects. Or you can have the cas9 protein and the guide RNA plasmids under inducible promoters, so you only get expression say if you introduce a small molecule to your cultured organism and limit the amount you deliver of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to if there are other systems \"superior\" to it, and by superior you mean more efficient, and has less off targeting effects? Sure those things may very well exist, since we haven't sequenced the entire planet yet! All joking aside, maybe start looking around at research groups that do adaptive immunity in prokaryotes, you might find some interesting ideas...<\/p>\n\n<p>VDJ is a very cool system that I know only a little about but this review might be worth checking out:\n<a href=\"http://www.idi.harvard.edu/uploads/investigators/Dudley_Adv_Immunol_05.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.idi.harvard.edu/uploads/investigators/Dudley_Adv_Immunol_05.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Also recombination in meiotic versus mitotic replication is covered in this review.\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090628/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090628/<\/a>\nSo to answer your question, I will have to defer to someone else!<\/p>\n\n<p>My question to you is what is \"advanced\"? Life as we understand it has been evolving for about 3-4 billion years. \"Advanced\" suggests that one organism has evolved better or faster. I don't know if I would call anything more advanced per se, but maybe more complicated and more capable of rapidly adapting to new environmental pressures? Bacteria have us trumped if there were rapid changes to the environment, global warming, asteroids careening into the planet etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Estimating this probability requires knowing how large the entire sequence space of the Earth is, some have estimated 5-50 million eukaryotic species but depends on what metric you would use to define a new species. It is unknown for prokaryotes. My guess is that you have 100's of millions of different organisms that are capable of having some type of adaptive immune system that may be inherently different from CRISPR/Cas9 system but still use some similar elements, like nucleic acid complementation, as a mode of defending against obligate parasites. Then the questions are how many of those organisms have we sequenced and how many proteins do we have any idea how they function based on sequence similarities to other proteins? Or if we have directly characterized their 3D structure based on Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo EM), NMR or X-ray crystallography. So, I imagine we have just hit the tip of the iceberg in finding natural enzymes that can function as gene editing and gene locating tools. Plus, we may start designing our own enzymes like what Professor David Baker at UW works on.

Many of the VIGS vectors that are available may be limited in terms of which tissues they can infect.

For example a worm has 3 giant axons which are almost the same length than the worm itself. So there was selection pressure on the length of the axon. The neuron requires a lot of energy to send signals to other neurons. Neurons use energy on nanowatt scale, average human cells use energy on picowatt scale... By long axons it requires less energy to send the message through a single axon than send it through multiple axons. That's the same why we use limited amount of undersea internet cables - currently about 200. If there is more data than a single cable can handle, only then lay we a parallel cable. So a possible answer is evolution of worm nervous systems combined with energy consumption optimization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another answer can be that neurons would be never capable to build multiple action potentials parallel. Maybe they cannot consume enough energy to hold charges separated by multiple axons. I don't intend to look for the details of that. It is technically possible to have <a href=\"http://uanews.org/story/how-neurons-get-wired\">neurons with multiple axons<\/a>, so you can grow things like that, but it is not clear if their axons can work parallel or not, and if they don't work parallel does they interfere the communication of each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>About single axon neural networks there are existing <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.3556&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">mathematical models<\/a>.

The topic are evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) regarding cooperation.<\/p>\n\n<p>I apologise for the long question. If you are already familiar with the topic and Dawkins' model of Cheat, Sucker and Grudger: my question is, how can Grudger be an ESS if it could be invaded both by Suckers (because they have no disadvantage against Grudger) and Cheats (because a Cheat minority is unlikely to meet the same Grudger twice, turning Grudger into Sucker effectively)?<\/p>\n\n<p>More detailed:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The model<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Near the end of chapter 10 (p 185 in my version), Dawkins uses a model of birds who clean each other of parasites, therefore helping in survival (as cleaning themselves they cannot reach every spot of their body). He defines three different behaviours for the model:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sucker - birds who indiscriminately help and clean other birds<\/li>\n<li>Cheat - birds who let others help them but never do so themselves<\/li>\n<li>Grudger - birds who help others and remember who they helped. If the same bird does not help them later (reciprocate), they will not help that bird again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Claim: Cheat and Grudger are ESS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>He claims that both Cheat and Grudger in themselves are ESS - that is, if all birds behave this way, none of the other behaviours can develop because they will be immediately penalised by lower chances of reproducing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The part that makes sense: Suckers is not an ESS, Cheat is<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Sucker is of course not an ESS. If all birds were Suckers, any Cheat that developed would have a huge reproductive advantage and Cheat genes would overtake the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being an ESS makes sense for Cheat. If all birds cheat, nobody will ever be helping each other. A minority of Suckers would be spending all their time helping and not getting anything in return, Cheats have the advantage and Suckers die out again. Grudger would be unlikely to meet a Cheat who they helped before again, so they too will spend all their time helping and die out again.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The part that confuses: Grudger is an ESS?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>But Dawkins also claims that Grudger is an ESS, and he seems very confident in that. Now I don't consider myself enough of a smartypants to claim that he's wrong, but I don't understand how Grudger can be an ESS. If all birds behave in this way, and for any reason some Sucker developed - the Sucker would have no disadvantage. All birds would still always be helping each other, so nothing would stop the Suckers from propagating equally well as the Grudgers, invading the gene pool.

See <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2424287/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for details. If this wouldn't be like this, things like blood transfusions or organ transplants wouldn't work.<\/p>\n\n<p>To identify genes there are different routes. \"In the old days\" (meaning before the possibility of massive high throughput sequencing or DNA microarrays), genes were usually discovered when they were connected to a disease which had a noticable phenotype. Researchers then tried to find out which protein or pathway was affected and from there went backwards to identify the genetic region. This way of discovery was relatively slow. An example for this kind of identification is the identification of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8343963\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mitf<\/a> gene which is important for the development of pigmentation.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you sequence DNA (doesn't matter here if these are complete genomes or only parts of it) you can identify genes based on homology with already known genes. You can also predict the presence of genes in a certain sequence based on regulatory sequences in the region before the gene (the promoter). These sequences are known and also highly conserved, so this gives a good estimate. Predicted genes usually need to be verified experimentally.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is done today are the so called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study\" rel=\"nofollow\">genome wide association studies<\/a>\". Here you take a big cohort of people which all share one phenotype (for example blue eye color). Then you take a second group of people which do not show this phenotype and analyse their genomes (usually by sequencing or SNP genotyping). Then you compare the two groups to find the differences. Ideally you can then more or less directly identify a causative mutation which is responsible for the phenotypic difference between the two study groups.

He started immediately with drinking small amounts of seawater, and would suck water from fish, and, if he had any fresh rain water, would eat raw fish. He sailed from Minorca to Barbados, eating supplied food and water only once.

A basic outline of the hormonal cycle that triggers these events will make this clear.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Proliferative (a.k.a follicular*) phase<\/strong><br>\nBeginning after menses (when the endometrium is thinned), the hypothalamus produces GnRH which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce LH and FSH. These in turn stimulate ovarian follicles to develop. A dominant follicle produces estradiol which causes the endometrium to thicken (proliferate).<\/p>\n\n<p>At a certain level of estrogen (actually estrogen/progesterone ratio), the feedback on the hypothalamus flips from a negative to a positive feedback loop. Thus, there is a GnRH followed by a LH surge. The latter triggers ovulation. Note that at this time the endometrium is stable due to relatively high estrogen levels. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Secretory (a.k.a. luteal*) phase<\/strong><br>\nAfter ovulation, the high levels of LH trigger formation of a corpus luteum from the tissues left behind after ovulation. The corpus luteum makes progesterone. This hormone triggers a change in the endometrium from a proliferative to a secretory state. Progesterone also provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, maintaining low levels of GnRH, LH, and FSH, so no new dominant follicles develop at this time.<\/p>\n\n<p>If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum will eventually (10-12 days) degenerate and stop producing progesterone. It is this abrupt drop in progesterone that triggers the sloughing of the endometrial lining. You can see these hormone shifts in an illustration like this: <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eoHt2.png\" alt=\"menstrual hormones\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The decline of the corpus luteum is correlated with a decline in serum levels of ovarian hormones including progesterone, estradiol, and inhibin A. Release from negative feedback provided by these hormones at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary permits FSH to rise, and the cycle begins again.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should now be able to see that: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Around the time of ovulation, the uterine lining is not fully developed and is stable due to the hormonal milieu. Menstruation does not occur.<\/li>\n<li>Around the time of menstruation, FSH and LH are suppressed in a way that is not conducive to ovulation. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In theory, yes, of course there would be a lower chance of initiating a viable pregnancy (<em>implantation<\/em> rather than <em>conception<\/em> is the most obvious problem) were the endometrial lining to be unstable at the time of ovulation.

In this condition, the corpus luteum does not produce adequate progesterone during the luteal phase to develop the endometrial lining in such a way as to support a healthy pregnancy. However, ovulation and menstruation are still time-separated events for the reasons outlined above. <\/p>\n\n<p>*Note that the first term is with respect to the endometrium; the second is with respect to the ovary.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Abbreviations:<br>\n<sub>\nGnRH - Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone; LH - Luteinizing Hormone; FSH - Follicule Stimulating Hormone\n<\/sub>  <\/p>\n\n<p>References<br>\n<sub>\n1. <a href=\"http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anatomy &amp; Physiology, Connexions Web site<\/a>.

It also happens to be a detail that seems very hard to express.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Depending on the organism, there can be from 10 to 14 c-subunits in the c-ring of ATP synthase. For practicality/consistency's sake, let's assume 10. <\/p>\n\n<p>Every c-subunit is protonated (from the cytoplasmic side of the mitochondrion) and rotated almost 360 degrees within the lipid membrane before it is ultimately deprotonated, which releases a proton into the matrix. Thus, since the c-ring is 10 subunits big (in this case), 10 protons are being introduced to the matrix every 360 degree turn, which mean that <em>1 proton = a 36 degree turn<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>These protons allow for the gamma-subunit to be turned at the inside of the hexamer (of 3 alpha-subunits and 3 catalytic beta-subunits) found below the rotor. The b-subunits are thus located 120 degrees apart. <em>Every 120 degrees precisely<\/em>, that beta-subunit changes shape, <em>dictated by the rotation of the gamma-subunit<\/em>, and enters one of the three states that ultimately catalyze one ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (since <strong>only one of the three states actually forms ATP<\/strong>). Since the gamma-subunit catalyses the formation of 1 ATP every 120 degrees, a <em>full 360 degree rotation would yield 3 ATPs<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where things go awry in my mind. Within 360 degrees, 10 protons and 3 ATPs are made. Thus, that makes (10/3) protons per ATP, or 3.33 protons/ATP. When the gamma-subunit receives a proton, it rotates 36 degrees, but <em>ATP formation only happens at precisely 120 degrees<\/em>, and the only common interval between 36 and 120 is 360 (when 3 as opposed to 1 ATPs are made)!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong>: The gamma-subunit <em>must<\/em> rotate in exactly 120 degree increments, because we observe it do so, as shown <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22388/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More detailed analysis in the presence of lower concentrations of ATP revealed that the γ subunit rotates in 120-degree increments, with each step corresponding to the hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Logically, this <em>shouldn't happen though<\/em>, since the closest increments of 36 to 120 degrees are 108 and 144.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize: How can 3.33 protons ultimately synthesize one, and only one ATP, knowing that a literal third of a proton doesn't exist (excluding quarks) and that increments of 36 degrees can never add up to exactly 120 degrees?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>References<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cA Proton Gradient Powers the Synthesis of ATP - Biochemistry - NCBI Bookshelf\u201d, n.d. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22388/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22388/<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","question_id":3186,"tags":["proteins","cellular-respiration"],"score":15,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3468,"up_vote_count":15,"last_edit_date":1345072142},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/377054ee866280e0cea2acf7f8761fe0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5427,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5427/seanny123","reputation":191,"display_name":"Seanny123","accept_rate":38},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/377054ee866280e0cea2acf7f8761fe0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5427,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5427/seanny123","reputation":191,"display_name":"Seanny123","accept_rate":38},"score":0,"post_id":21803,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWL7o.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9268,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9268/susan","reputation":2544,"display_name":"Susan"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1412267270,"comment_id":34545,"body":"@Susan thanks for the suggestion, I&#39;ve edited my question"}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21803/evolutionary-reasoning-behind-redundancy-of-cst-and-rust","last_activity_date":1412267209,"creation_date":1412189055,"answer_count":0,"title":"Evolutionary reasoning behind redundancy of CST and RuST","body":"<p>According to my neuro-anatomy class, both the Corsticospinal Tract (CST) and the Rubrospinal Tract (RuST) control upper limb movement.

Neither you, nor your critics, are right. There is a tiny bit of science in a paper on digitizing blots, generalizing from blots of a specific protein (PMID: 19517440), and they use grayscale for no given reason. Come to think, that is the best paper in the field of immunoblot quantification., and it still lacks evidence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Immunoblot is semiquantitative, meaning it may sort and order bands (and protein amounts), but it fails often at estimating differences and ratios, and may even fail to see differences. Just try your best to find a difference, in the knowledge that if there is no difference in protein amounts, any fiddling with contrast won't create a difference in bands quantitation.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is almost no difference between color and black-and-white digitized images of an immunoblot. The parts of the blot that are black will still appear in the computer as White = 0, even though a tri-color image file will detail it to Red = 0, Green = 0, Blue = 0. The parts that are nearly black will still be very close to zero.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only thing that changes a lot between RGB and color is the background.  The background may change, for example, from White = 200, to Red = 190, Green = 190, Blue = 220. There is one consequence of such switching between values for background. (These changes may be induced by switching between grayscale and RGB, but also by altering exposure time etc.) When you use a method where the background gets too close to the blots, the \"amplitude\" of the blots, the height of the peaks in ImageJ, will be reduced. This loss of contrast should wash out some of the differences between blot bands and lessen support for differences between bands (i.e., for the alternative hypothesis), making you miss a genuine protein difference.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, if your blot bands are different enough so that your percent increase / decrease is huge, and your p value is small, you are all set, regardless of the method you chose. Ask your critics to explain your observed differences other than by differences in protein. But if your quantification fails the p test, I think it will be a honest effort, to change the color from grayscale to RGB, or the other way around, just in case your first choice had been the one that dampens contrast. <\/p>\n","answer_id":21811,"question_id":21806,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1412224993}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21806/can-i-use-grayscale-images-when-working-with-imagej","last_activity_date":1412224993,"creation_date":1412200587,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can I use grayscale images when working with ImageJ?","body":"<p>I am using ImageJ to analyze Western Blots.

What does trying mean? Does trying doing A means that an individual is aware of how to achieve A and will behave so to achieve it? <\/p>\n\n<p>The likely correct answer (it really depends on you definition) is \"No\" (with some eventual exception among those that have high cognitive abilities such as humans). No, animals don't try to create a nice ecosystem. Animals (just like any living things) just evolve in response to their environment and this ends up creating ecosystems. The ecosystemic balance is just the result of the non-cooperative actions of the different species at play in the ecosystem. For example, animals reject nitrogen not in order to help plants to grow but only because nitrogen is a waste and is toxic for them. You may want to make you understand how evolution works.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those who have a good enough knowledge in evolutionary biology, I have to admit that the above answer might be slightly wrong if we consider some special kinds of selection such as kin selection, species selection or even ecosystem selection. I think the answer to the question remains \"no\" given the \"conscious\" side of the definition of trying that the OP was probably using.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cooperation is easy to explain, real altruism is more complicated. Real altruism is when one individual makes an action that benefits to the others lifespan reproductive success but decreases the lifetime reproductive success of the one producing the action.<\/p>\n\n<p>Within population real altruism can be explained by kin selection. see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10742/what-if-rb-c-in-hamiltons-rule\">this post<\/a> for more info.<\/p>\n\n<p>Between species real altruism is much more complicated to explain. It would need to use concepts such as species selection. But does between species real altruism even exist (beside some behaviour from species with high cognitive abilities)? I don't think so.<\/p>\n\n<p>What you are interested in is inter/species cooperation. Very often the individual that offers something to the other also directly gain something. For example, the animal excrete nitrogen because it is toxic and the plant take advantage of this. But sometimes an individual (actor) pay a cost for producing something to the benefit of the other individual (recipient). In return, the actor will receive something back from the recipient. For example, in the lichen, the algae offers energy while the fungi offers shelter. If one stops the other will die and both will lose. There are known cases also where individual A stops offering goods t individual B if individual B stops offering goods to individual A. This kind of traits are best studies with the tools of game theory.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21800,"question_id":21779,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1412221575},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c345be66512ee14f08acd1e27e387c4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1578,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1578/rumtscho","reputation":1534,"display_name":"rumtscho","accept_rate":70},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f38ae5bba0d830e5c01cd116ddc5257b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6195,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6195/user128932","reputation":332,"display_name":"user128932","accept_rate":70},"score":0,"post_id":21804,"edited":false,"creation_date":1412218333,"comment_id":34511,"body":"By the way I didn&#39;t say animals were &#39;doing&#39; things to be in a state of better &#39;equilibrium&#39; with their environment ,I just took this as a paraphrase from the movie the MATRIX.
