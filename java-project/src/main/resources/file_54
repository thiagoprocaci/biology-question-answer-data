That is, quantum interaction between atoms in molecule (organic dye or complex GFP) create permitted energy levels. There is \"ground state\" $S_0$, for example, and excited state $S_1$. You \"pump\" your molecule with excitation light from $S_0$ to $S_1$. All this can be nicely illustrated as absorption in Jablonski diagram (look at <em>a<\/em> for now):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ltULk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><em>via <a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/jablonski/lightandcolor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>\"Loss of energy\" here is some process via which molecule returns to ground state. In case of GFP energy is released as an emission photon. Nature of fluorophores is that they tend to return to ground state as the state of less energy, and almost all systems tends to go to state with lesser energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to your question. Why GFP can has different excitation profile but same emission? Notice, how in (a) molecule get pumped to highest state, then relaxes a bit to lowest of $S_1$ states and then go all the way to $S_0$? That initial relaxation is thermal relaxation. Some energy is lost, essentially, to water molecules around GFP. That is why emission is always \"more red\", i.e. has lower energy than excitation. Initial relaxation is why your GFP spectra also broad. There are many levels GFP can emit from, as well as be excited to. In crystals of GFP transitions will be very narrow, because much less of excitation energy will go not into fluorescence.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, my point is following. Nobody prevents one from engineering a mutant molecule of GFP that could be pumped to some even higher level $S_2$, which then relaxes to $S_1$ via non-irradiative process (e.g. gives energy to water, but not into fluorescence!). Only requirement is that for mutant direct pathway from $S_0$ to $S_1$ would be forbidden (see <em>b<\/em> and <em>c<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another point is that whether your spectra are different in shape or only intensity.

In this situation adding more subjects will not correct for this effect and therefore the only solution is to genotype additional subjects with another method (e.g. another chip or experimental protocol). Another source of non-random technical bias is at the phenotype measurement level. You might want, if possible, to measure the phenotype using other techniques to make sure that bias will be corrected.<\/p>\n\n<p>A replication cohort does not need to be huge and the actual size needed will largely depend on the effect size of the SNP seen in the discovery cohort. A \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power\" rel=\"nofollow\">power-to-detect<\/a>\" calculation would help in predicting the cohort size needed. For a SNP to be significant, it must pass Bonferroni correction but as you can run a statistical test at the candidate site only the correction will be usually not very astringent (i.e. you might run association tests on \"only\" a few dozens or hundreds SNPs).<\/p>\n\n<p>Historically GWAS replication was also required to correct for population structure but as the tools evolved substantially (e.g. the use of principal component analysis) and the cohort sizes are now substantially bigger compared to the first GWA-studies, this is less a concern. What was required is to sample independently other subjects from either the same or a different population.<\/p>\n\n<p>For your situation what you could do is to split your cohort into a discovery and a replication panel, genotype your subject in the replication panel using an independent technique, eventually do the same with the phenotyping and replicate you candidate SNPs. The replication panel needed is usually must smaller than the discovery cohort for the reasons stated in the previous paragraph.<\/p>\n\n<p>For your last question about the meta-analysis.

The antibodies are specific for certain cell surface markers, either expressed on your population of interest (positive selection), or expressed on undesired cell types (negative selection). After adding the antibody-coated beads to the cell mixture and incubating, the suspension is added to a special single-use separation column affixed to a magnet, to which the beads stick, while unlabeled cells flow through. If performing a negative selection, the flow-through is your population of interest and the bound beads and cells are discarded. If your cells of interest are bound to the beads (positive selection), the column is washed several times to make sure unbound or weakly-bound cells are washed through, then the column is removed from the magnet and the cell-bead complexes are eluted.<\/p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry#Fluorescence-activated_cell_sorting_.28FACS.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">fluorescence-activated cell sorting<\/a> or FACS, the initial complex cell mixture is first labeled with one or more cell surface marker-specific antibodies that have been conjugated to fluorescent dyes. Cells can also be analyzed that express one or more recombinant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein\" rel=\"nofollow\">fluorescent proteins<\/a> in conjunction with a gene of interest, allowing for selection of cells without using antibodies. After incubation and wash steps, red blood cells are lysed, if analyzing whole blood. The reason for RBC lysis is shown below:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/WZm0j.png\" alt=\"whole blood FACS\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Without lysis, the RBCs overwhelm the cytometer, as they make up around 95% of the cells in human whole blood. White blood cells (leukocytes), on the other hand, only make up 0.1-0.2% of cells, and lymphocytes between about 15 to 50% of leukocytes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cell mixture is then analyzed on a cell sorter such as a <a href=\"http://www.bdbiosciences.com/us/instruments/research/cell-sorters/bd-facsaria-iii/m/744763\" rel=\"nofollow\">BD FACSAria<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg1dL.jpg\" alt=\"FACS\">\n<sup>From: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescence_Assisted_Cell_Sorting_%28FACS%29_B.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescence_Assisted_Cell_Sorting_%28FACS%29_B.jpg<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>The cells pass in single file past one or more laser beams, which excite the dyes and cause them to fluoresce at a certain wavelength. The user can then use gating to select the combination and intensity of colors they are interested in, and when a cell meets the criteria, it is given an electrical charge, and electro magnets direct it into a collection container.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So what are the pros and cons of each technology? MACS separation generally is quicker than FACS staining, and a greater number of cells can be processed at one time (sometimes orders of magnitude more, depending on instrument and protocol). If you are, for example, looking to purify large numbers of CD4+ T cells from whole blood, MACS may be the better choice of the two (although I prefer the <a href=\"http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/Popular-Product-Lines/RosetteSep.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">RosetteSep<\/a> system for that particular requirement). MACS doesn't require a rather expensive dedicated instrument, although automatic platforms are available if needed. On the downside, most MACS-qualified beads are mostly only available from Miltenyi, so if they do not have beads with your particular marker of interest available, you will need to do the conjugation yourself, at the expense of time and possibly precious antibody while you optimize conditions. Fluorescent-conjugated antibodies are extremely common, and available from practically innumerable companies, so unless you are working with a self-generated antibody it's much more likely that you'll be able to find one for FACS quite easily. There <em>are<\/em> MACS beads that contain antibodies directed at certain fluorophores, so you can use flow antibodies for MACS, although optimization is likely still necessary. Finally, MACS separation is only an option for cells that have your marker of interest expressed on the cell surface.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the major advantages of FACS is multicolor staining (depending on the instrument you're using). This makes it much more straightforward to purify potentially rare populations that are only differentiated by their combined expression of a number of surface markers, necessitating multiple gating steps. If this were to be accomplished by MACS, you would need to go through multiple rounds of purification, something that could take longer than FACS, and not necessarily be feasible, as a certain number of cells are required for each MACS run. With FACS, these rare populations (which may only be tens or hundreds of cells per million) can be collected just as easily as more common ones. Also, as mentioned above, there are more antibodies available for flow/FACS than for direct MACS. Additionally, FACS allows for sorting of cells expressing GFP and relatives, letting you collect populations based on internal markers.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31490,"question_id":31482,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1429629565}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31482/magnetic-activated-cell-sorting-vs-facs","last_activity_date":1429629565,"creation_date":1429374912,"answer_count":1,"title":"Magnetic-activated cell sorting vs. FACS","body":"<p>When sorting cell populations it is possible to use either magnetic-activated cell sorting or fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS).

As it is stated in this paper long chain fatty acids are utilized through beta-oxidation to meet the high energy need of continuous contraction. Beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids produce far more ATPs than glucose. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_oxidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For an even-numbered saturated fat (C2n), n - 1 oxidations are necessary, and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of ATP are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as:\n  (n - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = total ATP or 14n-6 (alternatively)\n  For instance, the ATP yield of palmitate (C16, n = 8) is:\n  (8 - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = 106 ATP <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>While a single molecule of glucose produces 36 ATPs (under aerobic conditions)<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus use of fatty acids (fats) in cardiac muscle is beneficial because of their higher energy concentration.

Let's look at a diploid organism with two pairs of chromosomes: A and B. At the beginning of meiosis I, a cell will have one <em>copy<\/em> of both <em>pairs<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>A1 A2 B1 B2\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Then comes synthesis, duplicating all chromosomes.

If all oocytes mature, and are fertilized, the answer is clearly yes. However, not all oocytes are fertilized.

The probability of all the mother's genetic material being passed down increases with increasing fertilization ratio/egg number, so given the high number of offspring produced by many species of frog, I'd say that there is a good chance of all the mother's genetic material making it to the next generation, although it is not guaranteed.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26406,"question_id":21244,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1420483368},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/22ea15aa505ee3fdcc5cb40b00a31f63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9252,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9252/ajmansfield","reputation":131,"display_name":"AJMansfield"},"score":0,"post_id":26408,"edited":false,"creation_date":1420483567,"comment_id":42706,"body":"OK, thanks.

Because FAO lacks any data for some countries, and other countries under-report (for instance US figures don't include hives kept for pollination service and hives kept by small-scale operators) a reasonable round estimate of managed hives in the world is 100 million. (This implies a 128% correction to the FAO numbers).

Then I subtracted the number of managed hives from the carrying capacity to estimate wild hives.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although this formula probably overestimates large, cold countries and underestimates Africa (the formula gives 211 million feral hives in Africa when literature suggests closer to 300 million), in general, it seems to give not unreasonable estimates in comparison to the literature. Globally, this formula gives an estimate of 984 million wild hives. Given that land area included desert and other unsuitable habitat, it seemed reasonable to round down, and I took 900 million as my estimate.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Historical Populations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KuyLe.jpg\" alt=\"Hives of *Apis mellifera* over time.\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1961-2011<\/strong> \nFAO statistics date to 1961.

Before 1600, there were no European honey bees beyond their native range (Western Eurasia and Africa). However, once established in new areas (the usually cited first beehive in the USA in 1622), <em>Apis mellifera<\/em> rapidly spread in both managed and feral populations, in North America (17th c), South America (18th c), Australia (19th c) and East Asia (20th c) <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Crane 1999)<\/a>\n.<\/p>\n\n<p>I used carrying capacity of native range countries (just about 35% of the carrying capacity of the globe, or 350 million hives) as a before-1650 estimate,  and then assumed a geometric increase of about 2% per decade in available land area (ALA), as <em>Apis mellifera<\/em> bees and beekeeping made their way around the globe.<\/p>\n\n<p>To estimate the number of managed bees during this period, I assumed a human:hive ratio of 35:1**, and modelled hives based on historical estimates of human population, multiplied by the ALA for the decade. The 1650 estimate was 5 million managed hives.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Although diseases, pests, and pesticides have been reported to affect feral populations, I didn't find any solid information on this. For instance, feral populations of <em>Apis mellifera mellifera<\/em> and <em>A. m ligustica<\/em> have been widely reported to be in decline in the USA, but at the same time, feral populations of Africanized honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera<\/em> hybrids) have been rapidly spreading. Even with 90% losses in the USA, Canada, Japan, and Europe (areas affected by varroa) my estimates would only be decreased about 10%. However, it's also possible that land-use change has greatly affected feral bee populations <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-006-9054-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Moritz et al 2007)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>**This wasn't a totally wild guess. I first calculated the human:hive ratio for 1961-2011. This ratio was increasing - there were 71 people / hive in 2011, and 47 in 1961. Initially, I assumed the rate of change in the ratio to be constant, but this led to unrealistically large estimates for historically managed hives. However, the rate was clearly increasing (just, perhaps in a nonlinear way I didn't want to estimate), so I decided instead to compromise on a number less than 47 and greater than 4. I decided on 35, as it produced what seemed like a realistic estimate of 5 million hives in 1650, compared to around 20 million today for Eurasia and North Africa (excluding sub-saharan Africa where wild-harvest remains important and likely was even more so in the past).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.071\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <strong>Aizen MA, Harder LD<\/strong>. 2009.

One more thing - not all bacterial infections necessitate antibiotics which should be used sparingly because the world is running out of antibiotics.<\/p>\n","answer_id":25952,"question_id":25920,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1429442872}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25920/do-distinctions-between-dry-tickly-and-chesty-coughs-have-any-medical-basis","last_activity_date":1429442872,"creation_date":1418751447,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do distinctions between dry, tickly and chesty coughs have any medical basis?","body":"<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>At least in Britain you normally come across distinct kinds of cough medicine \"chesty\", \"dry\" and \"tickly\".<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fvu9K.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are \"chesty\", \"dry\" and \"tickly\" coughs always due to microoganisms?<\/li>\n<li>For the types of cough that are infectious, are differences due to different species of micro-organism or the same micro-organism at different stages of its development?<\/li>\n<li>Do the alternative treatments (e.g. levomenthol, squill, liquorice for chesty vs. glycerol for dry/tickly) merely deal with symptoms or do they actually help fight the infection? <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A related question is: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17121/what-is-the-cause-of-dry-cough\">What is the cause of dry cough?<\/a><\/p>\n","question_id":25920,"tags":["pathology","medicine","pathogenesis","treatment"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":119,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1418770758},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kAvbf.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12985,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12985/user1042928","reputation":111,"display_name":"user1042928"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d7c5cbd0c2f965a3712ff687c53f997?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14552,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14552/aaaaaa","reputation":2058,"display_name":"aaaaaa"},"score":0,"post_id":31494,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429424224,"comment_id":52769,"body":"shouldn&#39;t amount of light you detect depend on the excitation power? and total volume, and geometry of reaction volume?..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kAvbf.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12985,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12985/user1042928","reputation":111,"display_name":"user1042928"},"score":0,"post_id":31494,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d7c5cbd0c2f965a3712ff687c53f997?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14552,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14552/aaaaaa","reputation":2058,"display_name":"aaaaaa"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1429426419,"comment_id":52771,"body":"@aandreev Yes it would, I&#39;m sure things like the amounts of reactants would also play into this.

You proven, that my assumption was wrong and probably all of these elements are found in human body, but question remains unanswered actually (with little exception for Thaina&#39;s answer and silicon)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":0,"post_id":31440,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429275003,"comment_id":52682,"body":"In that case, please <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/posts/31440/edit\">edit<\/a> your question to reflect what you&#39;re currently asking.

Fold changes are not really bad but I would recommend that a t-test be done between the control and the test samples and if the difference is found statistically relevant then report the FC.

Here's my 2 cents:<\/p>\n\n<p>Your adjusted calculation does not normalize your data, it just subtracts the 'background' or control. For expression studies this is not good enough. Normalizing data for gene expression must involve setting it to a scale of another gene whose expression should be not only present but consistent between your treated and untreated samples. House keeping genes (you are probably using GAPDH) make good candidates for this because their expression <em>rarely<\/em> changes. If you don't normalize than you don't know if your your expression is actually changing, or if it's simply due to a larger input of mRNA. However it must be shown that the housekeeping gene's expression is also not changing, this is usually accomplished using a different sample set. Take if from me, I've done a lot of this and this step is one of the most important in your experiment.

I don't think it has been given a species name though, but for most purposes it functions as an independent species.

You could maybe argue that it is not single-celled, since it develops into tumours, but it most likely spreads as single cells and I suspect that the cells functions as independent entities. However, I don't know enought about the disease to really say if e.g. cells in the tumours differentiate into different types.

It is a type of junctional complex present only in vertebrates. The corresponding junctions that occur in invertebrates are septate junctions.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3Pbr.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n  \n  <p>They perform vital functions:They hold cells together.Barrier function, which can be further subdivided into protective barriers and functional barriers serving purposes such as material transport and maintenance of osmotic balance:They help to maintain the polarity of cells by preventing the lateral diffusion of integral membrane proteins between the apical and lateral/basal surfaces, allowing the specialized functions of each surface (for example receptor-mediated endocytosis at the apical surface and exocytosis at the basolateral surface) to be preserved. This aims to preserve the transcellular transport.They prevent the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells. So materials must actually enter the cells (by diffusion or active transport) in order to pass through the tissue. This pathway provides control over what substances are allowed through. (Tight junctions play this role in maintaining the blood\u2013brain barrier.) At the present time, it is still unclear whether the control is active or passive and how these pathways are formed. In one study for paracellular transport across the tight junction in kidney proximal tubule, a dual pathway model is proposed: large slit breaks formed by infrequent discontinuities in the TJ complex and numerous small circular pores.<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R3Pbr.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>In human physiology there are two main types of epithelia using distinct types of barrier mechanism. Dermal structures such as skin form a barrier from many layers of keratinised squamous cells. Internal epithelia on the other hand more often rely on tight cells junctions for their barrier function. This kind of barriers is mostly formed by only one or two layers of cells. Until recently it was not clear whether tight cell junctions also play any role in the barrier function of the skin and similar external epithelia, recent research suggests that this is indeed the case.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the next step mucous protect epithelial cells from released HCl.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a>  you will find more things.<\/p>\n","answer_id":6825,"question_id":6820,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6820/how-does-hcl-not-burn-our-stomach","last_activity_date":1429222427,"creation_date":1358276471,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does HCl not burn our stomach?","body":"<p>How does the digestive acid (HCl) not burn the surrounding skin of our stomach?

Many maintain that it is easier for digits to be reduced or lost during evolution than the reverse, however there is no evidence for this. The lengthening, or gaining of extra digits is common in marine reptiles, and within the theropods digit lengthening occurred at least once.

The reason for the lower pH is that this \"lower ionic strength implies higher electrical resistance and consequently a higher electric field, provoking the faster movement of the proteins and of every other charged particle in the gel. Such a high electric field coupled with the glycine in the running buffer (that will not go into the resolving gel due to the pH), helps to clean the sample from the Cl- ions from the Tris-HCl buffer. That concludes in a stack of clean, denatured, and equally charged proteins in the boundary with the resolving gel; this will account for a good quality PAGE.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Bassically, in the stacking gel the pore size is larger so it gives a chance for the larger proteins and smaller proteins to equalize with each other.  <\/p>\n\n<p>\"As the proteins are denatured and linearized by heating, SDS and dithiothreitol (if there is any di-sulfide bond), the proteins are loaded onto the wells on the stacking gel. The denatured proteins have a uniform mass to negative charge ratio. Since the current run from negative (top) to positive (bottom), the proteins move toward the bottom. When the electricity is turned on, the proteins and Tris-glycine enter the stacking gel. In stacking gel with pH 6.8, the N-terminal amino group of the proteins and amino acids are protonated at equilibrium which makes them less negative. The average electrophoretic mobility is very slow. A Gly-chloride ion boundary is formed since glycine moves slower than chloride ion. However, glycine still runs slightly faster than other proteins. As a result, the glycine keeps pushing the protein towards the chloride ion. In other words, the proteins are trapped between glycine and chloride ion. The proteins form a very tight band inside the stacking gel. <\/p>\n\n<p>Once the protein reaches the resolving gel, the pH changes from 6.8 to 8.8 and the pores are smaller. As pH increases, the N-terminal amino groups are deprotonated. Amino acids and proteins are more negatively charged at equilibrium than in stacking gel. As a result, glycine moves faster than proteins. Glycine and chloride ions move ahead of the proteins. As the pores are smaller in the resolving gel, the size of the protein determines the mobility (speed). So the smaller the protein is, the faster it will reach the bottom.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/bich608-602/bich608---announcements-and-more/sds-pagestackinggel\">SDS-PAGE stacking gel<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","answer_id":31422,"question_id":31419,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31419/what-is-the-purpose-of-using-two-layers-of-gel-in-sds-page","last_activity_date":1429208425,"creation_date":1429203320,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is the purpose of using two layers of gel in SDS- PAGE?","body":"<p>I just made a SDS-PAGE with a top layer of stacking gel and a bottom layer of separating gel with different pH values of 0.5M Tris-HCl.

Large complex plant genomes remain a particularly difficult challenge for de novo assembly for a variety of biological, computational and biomolecular reasons. Plant genomes can be nearly 100 times larger [25] than the currently sequenced bird [26], fish [27] or mammalian genomes [28]. In addition they can have much higher ploidy, which is estimated to occur in up to 80% of all plant species [29], and higher rates of heterozygosity and repeats [30] than their counterparts in other kingdoms. Furthermore, the gene content in plants can be very complex, as shown by the presence of large gene families and abundant pseudogenes with nearly identical sequences derived from recent whole genome duplication events and transposon activity [13]. Plants tend to have high copy chloroplasts and mitochondria organelles, which complicate assembly of their remnants in the nuclear genome and skew coverage levels [12]. Finally, it is often very difficult to extract large quantities of high-quality DNA from plant material, making it difficult to prepare proper libraries for sequencing.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From: Schatz, Witkowski and McCombie. \"<strong>Current challenges in de novo plant genome sequencing and assembly<\/strong>\".

If I understand you correctly, your main question is \"what were the 1st human's parents\". You cannot really get an answer to that because the question itself is wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>The idea that evolution moves in discrete bounds, that is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">speciation<\/a> occurs suddenly, from one generation to the next (also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lamarckian evolution<\/a>) has been abandoned years ago. That is simply not how evolution works (our modern knowledge of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">epigenetics<\/a> notwithstanding). The color analogy given by Konrad is indeed a good one.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, there was never an individual 'proto human'. This is also the case for all other species. What you <em>do<\/em> get, usually, is that a change in a species' environment (e.g. temperature, atmospheric pH, the introduction of a new predator etc) causes a particular mutation, or set of mutations, to become advantageous.<\/p>\n\n<p>One has to remember that a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome\" rel=\"nofollow\">genome<\/a> (an organism's genetic material, their DNA) is <em>not<\/em> stable. It is in fact extremely dynamic and constantly undergoing mutational changes. Most of these mutations are neutral, they do not affect the organism in any way. However, when an external change such as I mentioned before occurs, some of these mutations may become advantageous. <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a random mutation that causes an individual of a species to be more resistant to cold. If this occurs at the beginning of an ice age, that individual is more likely to reproduce, passing the mutation to its offspring. Over time, since the mutation-carriers are likelier to survive and reproduce, this mutation will spread across the population and become \"fixed\". <\/p>\n\n<p>At some point these changes accumulate past a certain <em>indefinable<\/em> point and we call a speciation event. This does not occur at the <em>individual<\/em> but at the <em>species<\/em> level. A good analogy here is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox\" rel=\"nofollow\">sorites paradox<\/a>. How many stones does it take to make a pile?<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to sum up, <strong>humans did not evolve <em>from<\/em> monkeys<\/strong>. Humans <em>and<\/em> monkeys at some point shared a common ancestor. Then, over a long time period, successive changes caused the two species to diverge. That is not the same thing. The linear concept of evolution that has one species morphing into the next is one of the greatest misrepresentations of a scientific concept ever perpetrated by the media and inflicted upon the unsuspecting public.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":3313,"question_id":3304,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1375666318},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b59b14d40a63bf44b5d6695d0e236a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1307/lubo-antonov","reputation":289,"display_name":"Lubo Antonov"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e440cd36c7e6f7d7fdb348bfb23e3b60?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":816,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/816/mohammad","reputation":263,"display_name":"Mohammad"},"score":1,"post_id":3314,"edited":false,"creation_date":1345905600,"comment_id":4977,"body":"Lucas, thanks for your answer.

A brief summary  ( with slight simplification):<\/p>\n\n<p>The ascending activating system (that is responsible for wakefulness) has two branches:<\/p>\n\n<p>The first one ascends to the thalamus and activates the thalamic relay neurons - these transmit information to the cortex. They get their main input form two acetylcholine producing group of cells:  the pedunculo-\npontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (PPT/LDT). These two group of cells are also the source of main input for reticular nucleus of the thalamus.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The neurons in the PPT/LDT fire most rapidly during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the stage accompanied by cortical\n  activation, loss of muscle tone in the body and active dreams<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The second branch, directly activates neurons in the hypothalamus, basal forebrain (BF) and cortex, bypassing the thalamus. This pathway has origins in monoaminergic neurons in the upper brainstem, caudal hypothalamus, as well as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), serotoninergic dorsal (DR) and median raphe nuclei, dopaminergic ventral periaqueductal grey matter and histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons. Input from this pathway to the cortex is extended /augmented by the lateral hypothalamic peptidergic neurons (that contain melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) or orexin/hypocretin), and BF neurons(that produce acetylcholine or GABA).<\/p>\n\n<p>Sleep is promoted by the so called VLPO (ventrolateral preoptic nucleus).\nThe VLPO send outputs to major group of cells of the arousal system in the hypothalamus and brainstem. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The VLPO neurons are primarily active during sleep, and contain the inhibitory neurotransmitters, galanin and GABA.\n  The VLPO also receives afferents from each of the major\n  monoaminergic systems. Both noradrenaline and serotonin inhibit\n  VLPO neurons. The latter do not have histamine receptors, but the\n  tuberomammillary neurons also contain GABA, which is inhibitory\n  to VLPO neurons, as well as several other potentially inhibitory pep\n  tides, such as galanin and endomorphin. Therefore, the VLPO can\n  be inhibited by the very arousal systems that it inhibits during sleep.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Da0A.png\" alt=\"sleep-wake pathways\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the quote from the paper these two systems can mutually inhibit each other and basically work as a seesaw or 'flip-flop switch'. In this system activity in one  subsystem shuts down the inhibition from the other subsystem and disinhibits its own action (selfreinforcing loop). The transition from one state to the other is relatively fast. Orexin plays important role in stabilizing the switch in one position or the other.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1YO0h.png\" alt=\"flip-flop switch\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Regulation pf sleep:<\/p>\n\n<p>Homeostatic:\nIt is unclear how homeaostatic regulation of sleep work, yet it has been proposed, that adenosine accumulation in the brain may signal for 'need for sleep'. The extended wakefulness causes the exhaustion of brain glycogen reserves and depletion of ATP levels. As ATP is degraded to ADP, AMP and eventually adenosine, extracellular adenosine levels rise in some parts of the brain including the BF. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition, adenosine might disinhibit the  VLPO via presynaptic A1 receptors by reducing inhibitory GABAergic inputs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies that during sleep ATP and energy sources are regenerated and free adenosine levels drop, thus inhibition of VLPO might take place again. \nAlso it is important to note that the amount of sleep we need is proportional to the time we spend awake.<\/p>\n\n<p>Circadian regulation:<\/p>\n\n<p>It is known that humans have quite precise :circadian rhythm:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain\u2019s \u2018master\n  clock\u2019. Neurons in the SCN fire in a 24-hour cycle that is driven by a\n  transcriptional\u2013translational loop, which persists even when the neurons are dissociated in cell culture.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The SCN has moderate output to the VLPO or orexin neurons, but it has more important projections to the adjacent subparaventricular zone (SPZ) and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The SPZ also has relatively limited projections to the VLPO, orexin\n  neurons and other components of the wake-sleep-regulatory system. However, a major target is the DMH. This region receives inputs from many more neurons in the SPZ than the SCN, so the SPZ is in a position to amplify the output of the SCN. (...) The DMH is one of the largest sources of input to the VLPO and orexin neurons and is crucial for conveying SCN influence to the wake\u2013sleep-regulatory system. The DMH projection to the VLPO comes largely from GABA-containing neurons (that is, those that promote wakefulness by inhibiting sleep), and the projection to the LHA originates from neurons containing glutamate and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (which should presumably be excitatory and promote wakefulness).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So as you can see our circadian rhythm as direct control over our sleep-wake cycle, and that the SCN can heavily promote awakening through SPZ and DMH.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thorough review and details can be found in the article I linked at the beginning, I only tried to select key information to provide a (not so ) brief summary. We only sleep about 7-8 hours normally because this is enough for homeostatic regeneration and our circadian rhythm promotes wakefulness in the morning (this is quite simplified).<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on their abstract these limited access papers might also be useful (unfortunately I do not have full access to them right now):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eurekaselect.com/87813/article\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eurekaselect.com/87813/article<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774210930018\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774210930018<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315001312\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315001312<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":31305,"question_id":28123,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1429113351}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28123/length-of-sleep-time","last_activity_date":1429113351,"creation_date":1422483489,"answer_count":1,"title":"Length of sleep time","body":"<p>Why do we wake up after 6-8 hours of sleep ?
