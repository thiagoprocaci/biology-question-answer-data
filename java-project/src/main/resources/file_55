To build his model, Hamilton expresses the genotype of the actor $j$ in terms of the genotype of the recipient of\nthe behavior, $i$. The genotype of $j$ is decomposed in two parts,\n``genes which are copies by direct replication of genes in $i$; the\nother part consists of non-replica genes'' (Hamilton 1970, p. 1219).\nHamilton (1970) further defines $q_{i}$ as the gene frequency of the\nreplica part, $b_{ij}$ represents the replica fraction, and $q$ is the average gene frequency in the population. From these definitions Hamilton (1970) jumps to the equality:\n\\begin{equation}\n      E (q_{j}) = \\frac{1}{1-b_{i}}\\left\\{ (b_{ij} - b_{i})q_{i} + (1-b_{ij})q\\right\\}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{align*}\n  b_{i} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j}b_{ij}\n\\end{align*}<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Hamilton derive the above equation?<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here is what <em>I think<\/em> Hamilton is doing.

Given that $\\beta = Cov (q_j, q_i)/Var (q_i)$, I suspect that the way to go is to rewrite $q_j$ and $q_i$ in terms of $b_{ij}$ and $b_i$ and calculate the regression coefficient.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Reference:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Hamilton 1970 \"Selfish and Spiteful Behaviour in an Evolutionary Model\" \n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v228/n5277/abs/2281218a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v228/n5277/abs/2281218a0.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qOtTC.png\" alt=\"Excerpt from Hamilton&#39;s paper\"><\/p>\n","question_id":27478,"tags":["evolution","natural-selection","mathematical-models","population-genetics","evolutionary-game-theory"],"score":6,"accepted_answer_id":31357,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":179,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1421788304},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3caeae5538fbb2129db7d70de332faa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14920,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14920/robert-rounthwaite","reputation":21,"display_name":"Robert Rounthwaite"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d50eaca20365c51634c9452835c50ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14629,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14629/cactuswoman","reputation":1902,"display_name":"CactusWoman","accept_rate":60},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1426283791,"creation_date":1426283791,"body":"<p>According to the \"Functional adaptation\" section of this <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/974108/details\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage<\/a>, Deinococcus radiodurans uses repair proteins to stitch up DNA after radiation damage.

However, as pointed in comments below, this book primarily concentrates on evolutionary biology and little else (at least in any noticeable depth) and puts forward many philosophical arguments regarding survival and passing your genes but doesn't talk about proteins or mRNA. \"The Extended Phenotype\" by Richard Dawkins again is an evolutionary biology book but it does talk about protein synthesis and the idea of phenotype and how genotype effects this and how the genotype of an organism can affect the environment!<\/p>\n\n<p>Books by Richard Dawkins tends to give examples of whole organisms and in a sense the bigger picture to make his points about elementary concepts which allow life and its propagation and how it shapes the environment but doesn't go too much into details in order to keep the attention of the reader and keep it interesting to the lay audience.

I believe the more plausible advantage to somatic cells not expressing telomerase is reduced transformative capacity because pre-cancers must first find a way to express telomerase."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVoco.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14587,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14587/the-nightman","reputation":1330,"display_name":"The Nightman","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":31335,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429033731,"comment_id":52421,"body":"I am still a little unclear about your question though, if it is how to we increase telomeres between generations, I guess that is explained, or is it  how we don&#39;t age as a population (a great question) due to constant mutations accumulation in germline cells?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33f4edf6c3ef6a809f4806e3efa74bb2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9796,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9796/rodolphe","reputation":6,"display_name":"Rodolphe"},"score":0,"post_id":31335,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429171439,"comment_id":52582,"body":"Yes ! the second question is exactly what I tried to ask.

The stretching of the muscle fibers augments\n  cardiac muscle contraction by increasing the calcium sensitivity of\n  the myofibrils, [3] causing a greater number of actin-myosin\n  cross-bridges to form within the muscle fibers. The force that any\n  single cardiac muscle fiber generates is proportional to the initial\n  sarcomere length (known as preload), and the stretch on the individual\n  fibers is related to the end-diastolic volume of the left and right\n  ventricles.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In the human heart, maximal force is generated with an initial\n  sarcomere length of 2.2 micrometers, a length which is rarely exceeded\n  in the normal heart. Initial lengths larger or smaller than this\n  optimal value will decrease the force the muscle can achieve. For\n  larger sarcomere lengths, this is the result of less overlap of the\n  thin and thick filaments; for smaller sarcomere lengths, the cause is\n  the decreased sensitivity for calcium by the myofilaments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>in one sentence, it is a response to tension.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31331,"question_id":31327,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31327/what-is-the-insight-of-frank-starling-law-of-the-heart","last_activity_date":1429013284,"creation_date":1428992539,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the insight of Frank Starling law of the heart?","body":"<p>The Frank Starling law appears to be a trivial observation:<\/p>\n\n<p>stroke volume is directly related to the end diastolic volume<\/p>\n\n<p>In everyday language, as more blood fills the heart, the heart pumps more blood out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can someone point out whether there are some inaccuracies in the above description because I don't understand why every article on FS law requires upward 20 pages.

This Nature <a href=\"http://circadian.com.au/sites/default/files/Molecular%20regulation%20of%20angiogenesis%20and%20lymphangiogenesis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">review<\/a> provides great overview of the process, I'll try and briefly summarize things:<\/p>\n\n<p>In general large arteries grow circumferential  to keep up with increased blood transfer, while capillaries branch to a more complex network in order to be able to supply blood to every cell. The circulation system starts as a <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>primitive \n  and uniform vascular structures, known as primary capil-\n  lary plexi,<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>that later develop into a hiearchical system of arteries, capillaries and veins. Main regulator of the morphogenesis of blood-vessels is the <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA; also known as vascular\n  permeability factor (VPF)).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This needed for the chemotaxis (the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus. from: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis<\/a>) and differentiation of endothelial precursor cells (EPCs; angioblasts), endothelial cells (ECs) and the assembly of ECs to vascular structures (termed vasculogenesis), as shown in the figure taken from the article I linked. EPCs themselves differentiate from mesodermal cells during early embryo development and aggregate to form blood islands that later form the  vasculogenic formation of honeycomb-shaped primary capillary plexi.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PUmGp.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Also it is important to note that :<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>alternative splicing of VEGFA can generate several variants of the growth factor, including the so-called b isoforms that differ in the last six C-terminal amino-acid residues and have anti-angiogenic properties. The balance between the different VEGFA isoforms can regulate blood-vessel \n  growth and patterning. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also local composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the interaction between ECM and cells can affect angiogenesis. For example release of matrix bound VEGF is important in the regulation of the level of available VEGF. Also: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore, the physical contact between ECs and pericytes is thought to induce a quiescent, non-sprouting phenotype.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sprouting itself carried out by the selection of some ECs in the capillary wall to lead the growth of the new sprout. See next figure also from the linked article:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eVeRK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Notch receptors and Delta-like 4 (DLL4) ligands play key role in this process. In tip cell(s) DLL4 expression is induced (in response to VEGFA), while the Notch signaling in neighboring cells (activated by the DLL4) represses sprouting (by down regulating VEGFR2 - VEGF receptor 2) . This is important, because otherwise excess sprouting would lead to a dense network of capillaries and blood would just spread out too thin and would be unable to supply the organs with oxygen and nutrients.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to tip ECs be able to grow new capillaries they ahve to undergo some changes. Mobility is most likely gained by activated secreted or cell-surface bound proteases, to locally degrade the basal membrane. Interaction with other ECs have to be changed, without completely disrputing cell-cell junctions and the integrity of the vessel-wall. Also the apical-basal (apical side - faces the lumen of the vessel) polarity of the cells have to be reversed in order to be able to grow outwards (from the basal side of the endothelium. In order for the new capillary vessel to grow, the elongation of the new sprout has to be polarized and directional. This is achieved by spatial concentration gradient of ECM bound VEGFA isoforms along with prominent expression of VEGFR2 in the tips of sprouts.\nFor blood functional blood vessels to be formed the tips must cease growing and exploratory phenotype when they find their target, and string EC-EC junctions need to be formed. Also the generation of the lumen of the newly formed vessel is required.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see forming of new blood vessels is a complex process that is controlled by local signals, yet it is part of a bigger process - the development of the embryo and organs that is regulated by many many genes and processes. Since our general architecture is the same it is logical that or circulatory system is similar.

In other words small differences in parameters would not affect the steady state of the system (parameter changes in a physically plausible range would not lead to bifurcations).<\/p>\n\n<p>By system I mean a set of entities connected to each other in a defined fashion. For example an ecosystem in which different species are connected to each other by interactions of the food chain. At steady state a system configuration (for instance- 10 foxes, 100 rabbits, 10000 grasses, 1000 honeybees etc) remains constant over time (that, however, doesn't mean it is static). Or in case of development a system may be the body defined by a set of certain phenotypes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Canalization/channelization refers to mechanisms that make the system follow a certain trajectory. So if you see it mathematically canalization keeps the trajectory dictated by a  given set of eigenvectors. In case of development you may call mechanisms such as dosage compensation, functional compensation by isoforms, parallel metabolic flux channels etc as canalizing mechanisms. <\/p>\n\n<p>So in contemporary usage we can call a system robust (a property of a system) whereas we should address mechanisms that help to preserve trajectories as canalizations. The final aim of canalization is to render robustness to the system but it is not the only mechanism that is responsible for robustness (for e.g. the steady state may just be independent of certain parameters).<\/p>\n\n<p>Robustness is a property of the system and is dependent on how the different entities of the system are coupled and what their interaction parameters are (rates etc).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>You should note that these are parlances that are adopted by different groups in the scientific community and may perhaps mean the same thing- this is merely my attempt to remove redundancy of terms by the means of semantics.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, plasticity is a different concept altogether. Plasticity is in a way opposite to robustness. This means that the qualitative nature of the system can change if certain parameters are tweaked. However, the system should still maintain its stability. In a stable system mild perturbations from steady state will result in system going back to that steady state - like a ball in a well. However, a system may inherently allow for multiple steady states (like switches), and depending on certain parameters the system can be in either of the states (but if pushed too far then the system can go to another stable steady state). This is called multistability. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: some people also use the term plastic to mean \"responsive\". The above definition may not be exhaustive or the most perfect.<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":21731,"question_id":21728,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1411993924},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1428876673,"creation_date":1428876338,"body":"<p>There are several subconcepts within the concept of robustness.

It is quite obvious that human intervention can often improve health in a way that your body alone cannot. To me, an intuitive way to classify the reasons why human intervention are important to improve health into two categories.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The body does not always react in an adaptive manner.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Example: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anaphylaxis<\/a> is a serious and sudden allergic reaction that may cause death. An allergic reaction is what is happening when your immune system recognize a chemical as a infectious element while it is not. The reaction of the body is not adaptive and taking medication such as an anti-histaminic can force the body to stop this \"stupid\" reaction.<\/li>\n<li>Note: There are reasons why the body cannot be always perfect but it is a bit long to make an overview here. There is stochasticity in the developmental processes, there is genetic variation for example due to always occurring deleterious mutations, there is also an arms race between parasites and host. This arm race leads parasites to take advantage of normal host physiological pathways. There are tons of other reasons that relate to the stochasticity and to the physic and physiological constraints of evolutionary processes.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>The body sometimes cannot (physical constraint) produce the action that is required to be performed to improve health.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Example:  If you have an important wound, then a human-made compression can by far improve your chance of the survival. The body is not able by itself to simulate this external compression to prevent blood to exit the body through the wound.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>You might easily find semantic issues with these categories though such as the question of cancer and its removal for example and some may argue against this categorization.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dehydration and thirst<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your example would fall into the first category. It is not so uncommon that the body needs water while not causing thirst. Because after 50 years old, the sensation of thirst start to diminished, dehydration without the sensation of thirst is common among old people. Dehydration along with hyperthermia is a relatively important cause of death during hot weather in summer. It is especially true in old people as the sensation of thirst diminishes with age.

In medicine, there's a saying:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Treat the patient, not the numbers.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Numbers can mislead people, sometimes quite seriously. Definitions of leukopenia vary: some define it as less than 5,000 WBCs per µL of blood; others define it as less than 4,000.<\/p>\n\n<p>Decreases in <em>specific<\/em> WBCs is usually described as neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia, etc. This, too, is important information, as each cell has a different function, and thus different results are possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>In leukopenia, bone marrow biopsies are very informative. They reveal if the cause is a decreased production of WBCs due to destruction of precursor cells, replacement of marrow by other tissue, invasion of marrow by cancer, etc. If a bone marrow biopsy is normal, that is very comforting.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>does the condition need to be treated?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most people with anti-epileptic drug (AED) induced leukopenia are just fine. Some common-sense precautions (such as avoiding other drugs which might also cause leukopenia, and checking a white count if you fall significantly ill) should be heeded. If your doctor is a neurologist, they should be thoroughly versed in the side effects of AEDs, as this constitutes a very large patient population for them. Some of the newer AEDs have a lower incidence of leukopenia. Talk to your doctor about the potential benefits and drawbacks of switching.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does leukopenia increase a person's chances of getting some non-infectious diseases too?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Theoretically possible, but not particularly likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are truly concerned, ask if you can get a referral to see a hematologist.

So if you were to ask why another polymerase? The article suggests gene duplication events. There are homologs for every RNAPII subunit in archaea, and and the subunits unique to RNAPI and III are homologous to transcription factors for RNAPII (TF's denoted TFII...). They further conclude that,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first RNAP duplication event(s) likely resulted in\n  two RNAPs: RNAPI and the ancestral RNAPII/RNAPIII. This\n  is supported by the existence of three homologous proteins\n  that are found in the RNAPII and RNAPIII transcriptional\n  systems but with no homologs in RNAPI. The first two proteins\n  are TFIIE a and b that are found in RNAPII and that\n  are homologous to RPC82 and RPC34 in RNAPIII, respectively.\n  In contrast, RNAPI lacks a homolog of either subunit\n  of TFIIE, indicating a loss of TFE in this RNAP. Thus, the\n  ancestral TFE was likely lost along the RNAPI lineage\n  but maintained in both RNAPII and RNAPIII following\n  duplication of the RNAPII/RNAPIII ancestor.

My understanding is that gaussian distribution tells you how much system response will increase (say, efficiency of treatment) if you increase stimulus by $dx$.

The cell replicates the DNA before dividing, so the error in replicating 3x or 4x is that upon division, the daughter cells will have more DNA than the initial cell, and every generation will have more DNA than the last. One replication ensures both daughter cells receive one functional genome. We can see the result of extra DNA in cases like Down Syndrome (trisomy of chromosome 21).<\/p>\n\n<p>The cell controls this process by controlling the cyclins present in the cell temporally, namely cyclin-A and cyclin-E when we talk about DNA replication in S-phase,<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y6wtD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>From wikipedia,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cyclin A resides in the nucleus during S phase where it is involved in the initiation and completion of DNA replication. As the cell passes from G1 into S phase, cyclin A associates with CDK2, replacing cyclin E. Cyclin E is responsible for initiating the assembly of the pre-replication complex. This complex makes chromatin capable of replication. When the amount of cyclin A/CDK2 complex reaches a threshold level, it terminates the assembly of the pre-replication complex made by cyclin E/CDK2. As the amount of Cyclin A/CDK2 complex increases, the complex initiates DNA replication.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Cyclin A has a second function in S phase, in addition to initiating DNA synthesis, Cyclin A ensures that DNA is replicated once per cell cycle by preventing the assembly of additional replication complexes. This is thought to occur through the phosphorylation of particular DNA replication machinery components, such as CDC6, by the cyclin A/CDK2 complex. Since the action of cyclin A/CDK2 inhibits that of cyclin E/CDK2, the sequential activation of cyclin E followed by the activation of cyclin A is important and tightly regulated in S phase.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_A\">Cyclin A<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":31232,"question_id":31220,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31220/dna-content-doubling-in-interphase","last_activity_date":1428696214,"creation_date":1428658487,"answer_count":1,"title":"DNA content doubling in interphase","body":"<p>Why does the DNA content of a cell get doubled in interphase?

Any tips are appreciated and let me know if I need to provide more info. <\/p>\n\n<p>cheers!<\/p>\n","question_id":28265,"tags":["fluorescent-microscopy","imaging"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":31185,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":336,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1428556059},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic4na.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14735,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14735/nandor-poka","reputation":2578,"display_name":"Nandor Poka","accept_rate":75},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7olI8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14709,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14709/berne","reputation":225,"display_name":"Berne"},"score":0,"post_id":31059,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428155532,"comment_id":51838,"body":"possible duplicate of <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30549/what-are-the-lower-and-upper-hearing-limits-of-the-human-ear\">What are the lower and upper hearing limits of the human ear?<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd6e4fcf1a42724473771262113ea60d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14802,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14802/sanchises","reputation":101,"display_name":"sanchises"},"score":2,"post_id":31059,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428156231,"comment_id":51839,"body":"Just googling &#39;frequency resolution human ear&#39; yields the wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psychoacoustics<\/a>: <b>Frequency resolution of the ear is 3.6 Hz within the octave of 1000 \u2013 2000 Hz<\/b>."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd6e4fcf1a42724473771262113ea60d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14802,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14802/sanchises","reputation":101,"display_name":"sanchises"},"score":2,"post_id":31059,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7olI8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14709,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14709/berne","reputation":225,"display_name":"Berne"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1428156324,"comment_id":51840,"body":"@Dane Not a duplicate; this question is about resolution, not range."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic4na.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14735,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14735/nandor-poka","reputation":2578,"display_name":"Nandor Poka","accept_rate":75},"score":1,"post_id":31059,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7olI8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14709,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14709/berne","reputation":225,"display_name":"Berne"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1428156328,"comment_id":51841,"body":"@Dane - I&quot;m aware of the lower and upper bounds of human hearing, my question is not about that.

Recall the sodium gates open the more positive the voltage is, which in turn opens more sodium gates. If a patch of neural membrane is depolarized, the charge  diffuses into the nearby patches of neural membrane. This will open the sodium channels of the nearby membrane patch. Now once enough sodium channels open, the neuron will fire a action potential, at this point potassium channels open and potassium rushes out of the cell repolarizing it(making it more negative). Furthermore the sodium gates close at positive voltages which further repolarizes the neuron and prevents back propagation. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the key is the influx of the sodium ions diffusing down the axon and causing a downstream depolarization of the axon.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I find <a href=\"http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/chapter03.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> website instructive, as well as this <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/ch12nervesaudrat/home/propagation-of-an-action-potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">picture<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlgeT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Update:\nAs the voltage builds up in the soma the charge spills over into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon_hillock\" rel=\"nofollow\">Axon Hillock<\/a> (an area of high concentration of sodium and potassium gates) If enough sodium ions diffuse into the axon hillock and passes a (somewhat ill defined) voltage threshold then the sodium gates will open and start the action potential.

These are comprised of 20 unique amino acids, and each is coded for by a stretch of DNA known as a codon. Codons are always 3 base-pairs (nucleotides) in length.<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA is made of 4 unique nucleotides; (<strong>A<\/strong>)denine, (<strong>G<\/strong>)uanine, (<strong>C<\/strong>)ytosine and (<strong>T<\/strong>)hymine. This means that there are 64 unique codons that can be made with these 4 bases (4*4*4).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Theory One - evolvability<\/h3>\n\n<p>If codons were only 2 bases in length then the variety of codons that could be created would be less (only 16 unique sequences if there are still 4 nucleotides). More unique nucleotides would be required to get enough unique sequences to code for the 20 amino acids (as well as the STOP codons). For instance, to get 64 unique sequences using a 2-bases-per-codon system there would need to be 8 unique nucleotides. <\/p>\n\n<p>We cannot ever 'know' what happened in evolutionary terms, but it seems likely that the 3-base (nucleotide) codon system would have arisen after a period of a 2-base system, as the biological systems became more complex. This would have allowed a lot more variation in the amino-acids used, and thus more \"evolvability\", which would have been very advantageous to early organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>However as the 4-unique-nucleotide/3-codon system is ubiquitous to all life we have discovered on earth, it seems likely that, back at the start of DNA (in fact probably RNA), this was the system that worked, or at least, this is the one that survived (although as Kevin rightly points out, we don't know whether there ever were any other systems).

In a recent paper D'Onofrio and Abel [<a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fgene.2014.00140/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>] state that ribosomes pause for different lengths of time at different codons (even if the codon codes for the same amino acid), and that this pausing affects the 3-dimensional structure of the final protein.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore the nucleotide sequence contains at least two \"layers\" of information: firstly which amino-acid should be added, and second the specific codon used for that amino acid can impact on the final structure of the protein. This could not be done with fewer nucleotides, but arguably even more control could be exerted with more nucleotides, but perhaps this comes back to my first point that this system evolved such a long time ago that more nucleotides were not necessary for life to \"work\" and proliferate into everything we see today.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>D'Onofrio and Abel, 2014. <em>Frontiers in Genetics<\/em>. <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fgene.2014.00140/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Redundancy of the genetic code enables translational pausing<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*only around 1% of our genome is actually protein-coding, and many non-protein-coding RNA products have very important functions, but I won't go into this here.

However, in this primordial genetic code, the last nt was likely meaningless (this has been reinvented in many mitochondrial genomes where a single tRNA, usually thanks to a modified U in the anticodon wobble position, recognizes up to 4 codons). Assuming the three nt codon primordial genetic code existed, we see that the reason for the three nt codon structure was not that two nt codon structure was not enough for coding everything (4^2 > 9, it would have sufficed), but something else. So what could it be? My educated guess is that it has to do with the A,P,E-site structure of the ribosome not fitting into a smaller molecular configuration (i.e. you couldn't have the adjacent A,P,E-sites within the space limited by just five phosphodiester bonds (six nt, three two nt codons) vs. eight phosphodiester bonds (nine nt, three three nt codons)). So in short, my view is that the primordial ribosomal structure was the key factor to the three nt codon structure of the genetic code, it couldn't have worked with anything less and anything more would have been a waste.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17223,"question_id":6933,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1399453288},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HSiMj.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15235,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15235/henryb","reputation":1,"display_name":"HenryB"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic4na.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14735,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14735/nandor-poka","reputation":2578,"display_name":"Nandor Poka","accept_rate":75},"score":0,"post_id":31109,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428347597,"comment_id":51974,"body":"The source you linked is really good, but simple linking is not exactly what this site is about.

Therefore your question goes down to what are the differences between linkage mapping and association studies.<\/p>\n\n<p>They are both forward genetic methods which aim to identify a genetic modification provoking a trait.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two major differences between both approaches are 1) linkage mapping requires a pedigree but can be performed using a fairly small sample size while 2) association studies can be performed at the population level but usually require a much larger sample size.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both approaches require markers but for different reasons. For linkage mapping, markers, such as microsatellites, are used to delimit the genomic region associated with the trait and take advantage of recombination events in the genome to pin down that region. This, of course, requires both 1) recombinant individuals in the pedigree and 2) at least one marker that is co-inherited with the trait. Linkage mapping allows to find virtually any genetic modifications, such as a genomic deletion, but only in the case of a genetic modification showing high penetrance.<\/p>\n\n<p>For association studies, markers are the actual genomic modification themselves (usually SNPs) and are used directly in statistical tests (often a logistic or linear regression) for association with the trait. This means that either 1) the causal marker is available or 2) at least one marker is highly co-inherited with the causal mutation (i.e. in linkage disequilibrium). Association studies allows to find both low- or high-penetrance mutations, given a sufficiently big sample size. Also an association study can be conducted in the presence of a non-discrete (i.e. linear) phenotype which one cannot use in linkage mapping.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another difference is that linkage mapping does not require any a priori knowledge of the genomic modification causing the trait while association studies do (as markers are statistically associated with the phenotype).<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually both methods will highlight, with varying resolution based on the phenotype and markers used, the genomic region causing a trait but rarely the actual causal mutation will be found with 100% certainty.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31104,"question_id":31099,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1428340670}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31099/markers-for-human-genetic-mapping","last_activity_date":1428340670,"creation_date":1428311846,"answer_count":1,"title":"Markers for human genetic mapping","body":"<p>For human genetic mapping several different types of markers are used:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RFLPs (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms)<\/li>\n<li>VNTRs (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) such as mini- and microsatellites<\/li>\n<li>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>What are the pro's and con's of using each type?<\/p>\n\n<p>Do any of these markers have a specific functionality in human genetic mapping, or can they all be used for the same purposes?<\/p>\n","question_id":31099,"tags":["genetics","molecular-genetics","human-genetics","human-genome"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":31104,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1428340110},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwVSN.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6576,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6576/paze","reputation":676,"display_name":"Paze","accept_rate":82},"closed_date":1435000183,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":0,"post_id":31101,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431761237,"comment_id":54810,"body":"Can you be a bit more specific?

I let you look out what the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance\" rel=\"nofollow\">variance<\/a> is. The F (originating from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">F-test<\/a>) allows, using the proper <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">F-distribution<\/a> cumulative density function (cdf) for the number of observation you have, to compute a p-value.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value\" rel=\"nofollow\">p-value<\/a> gives you the probability of obtaining the observed fit with your model (here a linear one) by random chance only. For example in your case a p-value=0.01 means that you have a 1% chance to observe this correlation just by chance. Usually the p-value threshold used to claim statistical significance is 0.05 (i.e. 5% chances to observe that fitting by random chance). In linear regression, the lowest the p-value the closest the distance (called variance) of the observed data point to the line.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination\" rel=\"nofollow\">$r^2$<\/a> is the coefficient of determination (or the square of the correlation coefficient). This measure is very interesting as it give you an estimate of the \"proportion of the data\" explained by your model. For example a $r^2$=1 means that 100% of the variance of the data is explained by your model, in other terms your model perfectly fits the data. A $r^2$=0 in the other hand means that your model does not at all explain the data (no fits between your model and the data).<\/p>\n\n<p>The $r^2$ and the p-value can be computed for any type of fitting, like trying to fit an exponential curve instead of a linear one. What you usually look for when modeling data is the highest $r^2$ possible. As all of this statistics are linked a higher $r^2$ means a lower p-value for an identical number of observations.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31080,"question_id":31064,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1428217245}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31064/how-can-i-use-this-data-to-make-a-function","last_activity_date":1428217245,"creation_date":1428164141,"answer_count":1,"title":"How can I use this data to make a function?","body":"<p>I'm currently in high school biology (final year) and am currently working on an assignment.
