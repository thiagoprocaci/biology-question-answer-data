We start with two men, Dave and John. We know Dave and John are related, either as brothers, or parent-child. Can we use genetics to work out their relationship?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>If Dave and John are brothers<\/strong> they will have the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">mtDNA, the DNA in the mitochondria<\/a>, because mitochondria are maternally inherited. They should have the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y chromosome<\/a>, because they have the same father (the Y comes from the father, and males have one Y to pass on, therefore they each received the same Y).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>If Dave (John) is John's (Dave's) father<\/strong>, then they should have different mtDNA because they have different mothers (assuming that Dave (John) didn't have a child with his mother or sister, and that mtDNA is variable within the population). They would have the same Y chromosome, because that is paternally inherited.<\/p>\n\n<p>If Dave and John have the same X chromosome it would be indicative of the same mother (there is a 50% probability that two male siblings will have the same X chromosome, while the probability of a father and son having the same X chromosome would be determined by variability of the X chromosomes within the population).<\/p>\n\n<p>For the autosomal part of the genome, each parent carries two copies of each gene. This means that, in each gene, there is the potential for four different alleles, with two of those being passed to the offspring. For example, at gene $A$ the mother may have alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$, while the father has $A_3$ and $A_4$. The offspring receives one copy from each parent, with equal probability. The probability that a son receives $A_3$ from the father is 50%. The probability that a second son receives the same $A_3$ allele is 50%.

It does not indicate the degree of genetic influence on the development of a trait of an individual. For example, it is incorrect to say that since the heritability of personality traits is about .6, that means that 60% of your personality is inherited from your parents and 40% comes from the environment.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So what is the plain english interpretation of heritability?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is it supposed to be the genetics version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination\" rel=\"nofollow\">$R^2$<\/a>?

What about categorical or binary traits?<\/p>\n\n<p>Hair and eye colour is categorical (I think?). So what, we assign a number for each colour and then compute the variance?<\/p>\n\n<p>ADHD is binary (I think?). Do we assign 0 for not having and 1 for having then compute variance?<\/p>\n\n<p>I seem to recall regressing binary or categorical variables needs some kind of adjustments and hence interpretations of estimates (such as intercepts or slopes) may be different.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Also, the book linked above says<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>heritability represents the degree to which the variance in a trait is attributable to genetics in the population on average<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Combining that with the Wiki paragraph above, I don't think someone saying<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eye colour is around 98% heritable.

As a result, gray-matter volumes\n  increase. As childhood draws to a close and adolescence begins, the brain\n  switches from overproduction mode to selection mode. Early in the second\n  decade of life, the brain stops overproducing synapses in the frontal lobes and\n  puts the synapses that exist on the chopping block. Hundreds of billions of points\n  of communication will be sacrificed through the teenage years. Only those that\n  form meaningful, useful points of contact will be kept. Guided by a teenager\u2019s\n  experiences, the frontal lobes are shaped and molded into a configuration that\n  will carry the individual, for better or worse, through the adult years. As this\n  pruning process unfolds, gray-matter volumes decrease.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Changes in other parts of the cortex (specifically temporal lobes)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The temporal lobes, which are critical for memory formation as well as processing\n  auditory information and seeing detailed patterns and shapes, do not reach\n  their maximum levels of gray matter until the age of 16 to 17, at which point they\n  plateau. The temporal lobes contain the hippocampus, a structure that is central\n  to creating an autobiographical record of what one does and what one learns.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sources:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>White, Aaron M. \"Understanding Adolescent Brain Development and Its Implications for the Clinician.\" Division of Medical Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3374, Durham, NC 27710, USA, 2009.

I&#39;ll look into all of this"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1454695584,"creation_date":1454695584,"body":"<p><strong>TL;DR:<\/strong> There are many ways a neuron can change after a neural impulse happens including calcium influx, long term potentiation and depression, and G-protein coupled receptors. While not an exhaustive list by any means I'll give a brief summary of some mechanisms I know best.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Calcium Entry<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There exist calcium channels that open in response to a variety of signals be it voltage depolarization (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel\" rel=\"nofollow\">voltage gated calcium channels<\/a>), neurotransmitter acetylcholine (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nicotinic-Receptor<\/a>) or Both depolarization and Neurotransmitter binding (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">NMDA receptor<\/a>). There is much more calcium outside the cell than inside the cell. Once inside the cell calcium binds to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EF_hand\" rel=\"nofollow\">EF-hands<\/a> in various calcium-binding enzymes like <a href=\"http://Calmodulin\" rel=\"nofollow\">calmodulin<\/a>. When calcium binds to the EF-hands of the calmolulin protein it activates and from there can interact with the other enzymes responsible for cell signaling and the effects can be quite diverse depending on what the neuron is responsible for doing and the specific signaling cascade it sets off. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LTP/LTD<\/strong>\nI'll focus on the NMDA receptor(excitatory Glutamate/Glycine receptor) in the CA1 region in hippocampus. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation\" rel=\"nofollow\">LTP<\/a> (or Long Term potentiation) occurs when a synapse (connection between neurons) becomes stronger, meaning the post-synaptic neurons response to the same stimulus from the pre-synaptic neuron is stronger after LTP has occurred. LTD (or long term depression) is the opposite effect where a neuron's response to the same stimulus is weaker after LTD. <\/p>\n\n<p>The LTP whole process is dependent on calcium entering through the NMDA receptor channel. When both glutamate and glycine are released pre-synaptically they open the channel,  allowing calcium ions to flow into the cell. However, If the voltage in the post-synaptic membrane is too low, Magnesium will get stuck in the channel blocking calcium (and the other ions too!). If the neuron has previously been stimulated and depolarized, by another neurotransmitter/receptor system like AMPA the voltage will be positive enough to pop the magnesium out of place and allow calcium into the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>Once calcium is in the cell it is bound to calmodulin which then binds to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase_II\" rel=\"nofollow\">CaMKII<\/a> (an enzyme activated by the calcium/calmodulin complex). This will cause a long and complicated signaling cascade which results in AMPA (the other excitatory glutamate receptor in the post-synaptic region) to be phosphorylated causing it to be more active. Furthermore the signaling cascade can cause an increase in AMPA receptor creation and subsequent insertion into the post-synaptic membrane. This of course results in LTP.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many rules in biology one quickly finds exceptions and caveats to nice rules of thumb (In fact I learned of a few just by preparing this answer!) LTD (long term depression) can occur in the hippocampus as well, and is dependent on the influx of calcium! As paradoxical as that seems, there is a negative feed back loop dependent on the levels of calcium ions inside the neuron, such that strong pre-synaptic stimuli create LTP (potentiation) and weaker (lower frequency) stimuli cause LTD (depression) and rare or intermittent stimuli cause no response. (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_depression\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v369/n6480/pdf/369486a0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> for reference). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>G-Protein coupled Receptors<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">G-Protein coupled Receptors<\/a> are more of a general family of proteins than a specific example. They are metabotropic receptors (meaning they do not allow Ion's to flow through them). Rather when bound they release an G-Protein, which like calmodulin binds to other enzymes and activates them allowing them to do their job. They  can respond to many different neurotransmitters (or more generally ligands) and can do lots of different tasks depending on the  on what type of G-Protein it releases. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'll give the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor_M2\" rel=\"nofollow\">muscarinic<\/a>(M2) receptor for acetylcholine as an example. This receptor is found in the heart and responds to acetylcholine release from the Vagus nerve. When the GCPR binds to the acetylcholine it releases its G$\\beta$ unit and it binds to potassium ion channels in the heart. This causes the outward flow of potassium ions thus lowering the voltage( hyper-polarizing the heart cell). <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore G-coupled proteins can even induce changes in how many are present in the membrane (i.e. they are self regulating). These are produced by internal signaling cascades and are thought to be the reason for tolerance of drugs. Take for example the $\\mu$-opioid receptor (activated by morphine, heroine and other similar compounds). These drugs will induce changes in how well the protein response to the morphine and if enough exposure then the cell will actually take the receptor back into the cell body and thus off the membrane in a process called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">endocytosis<\/a>.

As this will (hopefully) be the first time that the body has encountered the antigens on the pseudo-pathogen's surface, the response is called the primary response.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This consists of two main divisions: the cell mediated pathway and the humoral pathway.  In vaccination it is the humoral pathway that is important.  This is where a division of white blood cells (B-Cells) produce antibodies that are complementary to the antigens on the pathogen surface, causing a negative effect to the pathogen (death, inability to reproduce, de-activation of toxins, etc.).  However as each B-Cell produces a different antibody, there needs to be a mechanism to select the correct one:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Antigen Presentation<\/strong> (technically part of the cell-mediated-response) - a phagocyte engulfs the pathogen and displays the pathogenic antigens on its own surface.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clonal Selection<\/strong> - B-Cells that are attracted to the invasion site attempt to bind their antibodies onto the pathogen's antigens.  <strong>It takes time for this to occur successfully<\/strong> as you are essentially waiting for the correct mutation to happen. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Clonal Expansion<\/strong> - Once a complementary antibody producing B-Cell has been found it is then activated with the help of a T-Helper cell.  This causes it to divide rapidly whereupon these cloned specific B cells can secrete their antibodies which will cause detriment to the pathogen. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It's at this point that I can start to answer your specific question.  The large clone of B cells will then sub-divide into two types.  Plasma Cells remain in the blood and produce antibodies to fight the infection.  The other type, much smaller in proportion, are called Memory Cells.  These cells have a very long lifetime and move to lymph nodes across the body (including the spleen), where they remain dormant until the same pathogen is found again.  <\/p>\n\n<p>When this is the case, the memory cells are activated by T-helpers so that they can divide into massive numbers of plasma cells to fight the infection the second time.  This secondary response is a much faster as the clonal selection stage does not have to wait for the right mutation - they are already waiting in the lymph nodes.  The response is also much stronger as each memory cell can produce large numbers of plasma cells - i.e. you can start with multiple activated B-cells (as many as you have memory cells) rather than just the one that has mutated into a complementary shape in the primary immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>The aim of the vaccine is for the secondary response to be so quick that potentially life threatening symptoms do not occur; the body has time to find and store the correct antigen in a safe environment as the pathogen has been deactivated.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":865,"question_id":855,"up_vote_count":17},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15f9d8beda0341f0a97ab2f4e63d094e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":67,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/67/fomite","reputation":2369,"display_name":"Fomite"},"score":13,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1328138562,"creation_date":1328138562,"body":"<p>MBQ and Rory M have already given decent answers on the \"hows\" of how the vaccine memory is formed. Now, for some twists:<\/p>\n\n<p>There are three (general) types of vaccine, all of which are meant to make your body \"think\" its being infected and provoke an immune response, while at the same time not causing active infection. They are:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Live attenuated. These vaccines are made up of living pathogens that have, through a variety of methods, been rendered essentially harmless. Never the less, they are infecting you. It's a bit like getting into a shootout with people carrying Nerf guns. Good news is, the bullets are foam, but they're still shooting you. The advantages to these vaccines are that, generally speaking, they were easier to make, and because you are infected, you can shed the pathogen back into the environment, spreading the vaccine around a bit. The disadvantage? Sometimes the pathogens de-attenuate, and cause disease.<\/li>\n<li>Killed. Dead pathogen - your body responds to the presence of foreign antigens, develops an immune memory, and that's that. You gain safety, but lose the secondary spread of vaccinating attenuated pathogens.<\/li>\n<li>Virus-Like Particles. This is the sexy new class of vaccines, that is both dead and...not real. Synthetically produced, these vaccines (like the HPV vaccine) are both harmless and provoke an immune response, and can be customized - they can have antigens to different strains, etc. that you can't do just with attenuating or killing pathogens in the wild. They're awesome, and brilliant, and expensive as hell to develop and produce.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Once your body \"learns\" from the vaccine, how well it retains that memory also may vary. Some vaccines provoke a strong immune response, and the pathogen they target is genetically stable enough that you're pretty much set for life. Others, like the chicken pox vaccine, wane over time as your body isn't challenged by new exposures to the pathogen, and needs to be \"reupped\" now and again by giving you another dose of the vaccine, known as a booster. For some vaccines where your vaccine-triggered immunity may wane over time, we might not bother with a booster because you're now old enough that you're out of danger. The HPV vaccine comes to mind again - we're not <em>sure<\/em> you're immune for life, but if we can make sure you're immune until say, 65 or 70, it doesn't really matter, because it will take years for cervical cancer from an HPV infection to develop anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>Still others target diseases that mutate rapidly enough that your body's memory doesn't last long.

Individuals having greater fitness will leave more offsprings and therefore the genes of these individuals raises in frequency in the population. There is little generalities to be made about what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotypic<\/a> traits are good for populations (but see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10970/empirical-evidence-for-species-selection\">species selection<\/a>). For example, \"white fur\" is a very good trait for a polar bear but would highly deleterious for a mealworm. The only thing that we can say is that those that have the phenotypic traits that yield to a big fitness will transmit their genes and therefore, the frequency of this trait whatever that is will increase in frequency.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if a species evolved from another, it did so because it's somehow better, right?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you observe different species you cannot say that any of these species evolve from any other one you can today observe. The correct way of looking at two species is that they share a common ancestor in a given past. Therefore, looking at a cat and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_blue_tit\" rel=\"nofollow\">blue tit<\/a> you cannot say that one species evolved from the other one but you can only say that these two species share a common ancestor (just like any other pair of species) that was neither a cat nor a blue tit. The example is obvious because cats and blue tits are \"not so closely related\" (everything is relative) but the same logic hold for any pair of species.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why are there species rather than a long continuum?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The simplest and most obvious reason why there are species within which individuals are more similar compare to each than to individuals from other species is due to the definition (the most common definition because different definitions exist!) itself of a species. <strong>A species is a group of individuals that can interbreed<\/strong>.

Their traits will mix up and you won't be able to tell two different groups apart. All individuals within the new mixed group are a mixed of the individuals from the two previous groups (under some circumstances this process has been sometimes called \"reverse speciation\"). If now you take one single group of individuals. You split them in two groups in the sense that you don't allow individuals from group 1 to mate with individuals from group 2. You will see that after some evolutionary time, the individuals of group 1 will tend to resemble much more to individuals of group 1 (its own group) than to individuals of group 2. If you wait long enough so that these two groups of individuals become different enough so that they can't interbreed any more because they diverged too much, then you have what is called a reproductive isolation and under the common definition of species, you can say that a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">speciation<\/a> (You may want to have a look to the wiki article for \"speciation\") occurred and therefore you have two new species instead of one ancestral species.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may wonder <strong>\"But why the two groups tend to diverge through times?\"<\/strong>. There are several processes that explain that divergence:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mutations\n\n<ul>\n<li>Different mutations occur in the different groups (just by chance)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Natural selection\n\n<ul>\n<li>The environment differs and the selection pressures differ selecting for different traits in the two species.

They're just not <em>uniformly distributed<\/em> over the continuum; they're clustered around forms that are most likely to survive and reproduce, and the lowest-energy paths between them.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is because evolution is basically a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_optimization\">stochastic optimization<\/a> algorithm, one that finds the \"best\" set of parameters for maximizing some function by randomly perturbing an initial set of input values. In fact, some of the best optimization algorithms today are based on ideas drawn directly from evolution and called \"evolutionary algorithms\".<\/p>\n\n<p>In mathematics, given enough time, these algorithms will all converge on one optimum solution and nothing else. Why isn't it like that in nature? Because in mathematics, the \"fitness function\" that we're optimizing for stays the same for a given problem for as long as the algorithm runs. It represents the specific problem we're trying to solve. In nature, there's no outside force imposing a fitness function; an organism's survival depends on millions of factors in its environment which change over time, many of which depend on the survival and properties of the <em>other<\/em> organisms in its environment (competition, symbiosis, predator/prey relationships, etc.) This is a chaotic system so complex that it could easily go for billions of years without reaching a steady state, and even if it did, external changes (like the odd asteroid impact, to use an extreme example) would still come around to shake things up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another reason for the clustering is because a lot of the \"intermediate states\" in the genetic space have a fitness of zero \u2014 these are the states between species that can't interbreed, or that have sterile offspring. The categorization of \"species\" is based on this, and although it's not exact, it's still generally true that the more different two creatures are, the less likely they can have viable offspring. This makes evolution more likely to explore the spaces near already-successful organisms, and less likely to produce radical new things by hybridization.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19770,"question_id":19762,"up_vote_count":20,"last_edit_date":1405711967},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93ad97cd6d264067b56ee1e08fa0b73d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/540/superbest","reputation":2283,"display_name":"Superbest","accept_rate":69},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1414636424,"creation_date":1414636424,"body":"<p>Organisms on Earth did not evolve in a homogenous environment. A critical part of speciation (when you go from a single species into two or more) is a reproductive barrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be a literal, physical barrier - mountain range appears between two populations, valley in the middle of habitat floods and isolates the two halves of the population, a small group is thrown by some catastrophe on a remote island and cannot escape, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>It can also be a genetic barrier: Imagine a bird species where males compete for mates with their bright blue crests, and rare mutations occasionally lead to red-crested males which cannot mate at all. If some female birds happen to mate with undesirable red-crested males for a few generations, two parallel sub-populations may develop: Birds which prefer red crests and bird which prefer blue crests. These populations may be very unlikely to interbreed.<\/p>\n\n<p>There may be more complicated ways of erecting a barrier. For instance, a population of flowering plants that could previously interbreed arbitrarily may find that the ecosystem has experienced some crisis, and now the pollinating insects have become fastidious and only visit certain flowers and not others. Another example: While humans are currently a single species, because of culture (eg. language) certain human subpopulations (such as European nations) are much more likely to breed within themselves than between themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how the barrier comes to be, once a barrier can separate a species into sub-populations, the machinery of speciation is set in motion. All species evolve over time in different ways, especially if their environment does not have a very long history of unusual stability. As populations evolve, they try to stay somewhat coherent - the changes tend to be such that they still permit everyone in the population to mate with each other; otherwise they would impose a fitness cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if two subpopulations are not in contact, there is nothing enforcing compatibility between them. Therefore, as evolution does its work, these are free to wildly diverge from each other. Recall the example of the bird species in which males with blue crests enjoy reproductive success. The color itself is not particularly important, but it is important that the males all have the same color crest and the females prefer the same color. So as these birds evolve, the crest color can slowly drift in hue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's say you took these birds, and set a few of them free in one continent, and another group free on another continent. Again, over time, the crest color will shift. However, there is nothing stopping from the color in continent A from shifting to red while the color in continent B shifts to green. There is, after all, no advantage to being compatible with a population you are not in contact with.<\/p>\n\n<p>The example above is largely behavioral, but non-behavioral examples are also possible. A very fundamental process is fertilization: Eggs have an ECM made up of proteins unique to that species, while sperm have enzymes to digest the coat of their own species. Because of this, cross-species fertilization is very difficult. Again, once you erect some kind of barrier between two populations, the systems of coat proteins and enzymes in the gametes of either population may evolve in divergent ways - they evolve in small steps, so that the interaction partner protein can always keep up, but compatibility with the isolated population is not selected for, and if the isolated groups are reunited after a very long time their gametes may end up becoming unable to fertilize each other.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23568,"question_id":19762,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19762/why-are-there-species-instead-of-a-continuum-of-various-animals","last_activity_date":1454635553,"creation_date":1405704231,"answer_count":5,"title":"Why are there species instead of a continuum of various animals?","body":"<p>As I understand it, various animal traits have to evolve gradually, but what happens to the species that are \"neither here nor there\"?<\/p>\n\n<p>To put it differently, if a species evolved from another, it did so because it's somehow better, right?

It is important first of all, to note that empirical observations show that <em>beneficial alleles tend to be more dominant than detrimental alleles<\/em>. There are a number of hypotheses and I won't be able to make a complete review. Among the two main hypotheses to explain the evolution of dominance, one has been formulated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ronald Fisher<\/a> and one by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sewall Wright (and J.B.S Haldane)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fisher's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Fisher's hypothesis, between two equally beneficial alleles, if one is more dominant than the other than it's heterozygote carrier will have higher fitness. In consequence, beneficial alleles evolve to become more dominant while detrimental alleles evolve to be recessive (so that they can hide from selection in heterozygotes). The main criticism to this model is that selection for dominance is possible only when the locus is polymorphic. This means that the strength of selection for dominance is of the level of the mutation rate, seemingly way too weak to explain the observed pattern of dominance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Wright's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Wright's hypothesis, beneficial alleles are more dominant because of the kinetic of biochemical reactions. The rate of a biochemical reaction is a function of the concentration in the substrates of interest. The function is called \"Michaelis-Menten function\" after the name of the authors. The Michaelis-Menten function looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFgql.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Think about a knock-out mutation. Such mutation will decrease by half the concentration of protein the gene in question produce in heterozygotes. Imagine, the concentration of proteins in the wildtype homozygote was 3 (see above graph). The rate of reaction of this homozygote is therefore about 3. The heterozygote would have a concentration of 1.5 and the rate of the reaction is therefore about 2.5-2.75. Assuming that the rate of this biochemical reaction is directly related to fitness, then a the locus of interest, benefical alleles are necessarily dominant and detrimental alleles are necessarily recessive. Selection for dominance is not involved in Wirght's model.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to that, if you have a series of biochemical reactions, you will likely have one reaction that is causing a bottleneck. One reaction that is the limiting factor of the speed of some biochemical pathway. Let's call this reaction <code>process A<\/code>. If a mutation occurs on a gene coding for any other reaction <code>process B<\/code> that is not the limiting factor (<code>process A<\/code>), then this mutation will have no effect on fitness as long as it is not important enough to make <code>process B<\/code> slower than process <code>A<\/code>. This may lead to pattern of dominance. I am not quite sure by how much of this has been formulated by Wright and Haldane though.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is Fisher's or Wright's hypothesis correct?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>To my understanding<\/em>, current state of the art is to consider Wright's model to be correct and Fisher's model to be wrong. In reality, the truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes. There exists more detailed (and more mechanistic) models of the evolution of dominance that and the above dichotomy might not be very representative of the current debate on the subject. For example, I (vaguely) remember that during my undergrad, Sylvain Billiard gave a talk at my university in which he reported that some alleles actually have some domain that are directly responsible for decreasing the expression of the other allele on the sister chromosome suggesting that Fisher's hypothesis might sometime be quite a good explanation as well.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This answer was recycled from what I wrote <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1294/why-are-some-genes-dominant-over-others-what-is-the-mechanism-behind-it/27594#27594\">here<\/a>.

The vaccine is often trivalent, protecting against three different strains on flu: Two influenza A and one influenza B. You can read about the process directly from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm\">CDC<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two major viral receptors are neuraminidase and hemeagglutinin. They determine the serotype of the virus, such as H1N1. They serve as peptide antigens for immune recognition. Where influenza infects a cell, it starts to produce proteins essential to it's replication in the host cytoplasm.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Innate_immune_system.png\"><strong>innate immunue system<\/strong><\/a>, upon realizing there's an infection, does quite a bit to try and mitigate things but it's a messy job. Looking at the link, lots of inflammation, damage and dead tissue. At that, there will be no memory of the same infection, and the same process happens over and over unless there's a better way to take care of things.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is really where your adaptive immune system comes in, T/B cell, antibodies, etc. A wild type influenza virus stimulates the same adaptive response as the strains in a flu vaccine: Proteins such as the neuraminidase are picked up by macrophages or dendritic cells, and they enter transport to the closest lymph node. On the way, they chop up the viral protein into <em>peptide antigens<\/em> and load them onto MHC-II molecules, and export the complex to the cell surface, becoming antigen-presenting cells or APCs. T cells expressing CD4 coreceptor can interact with the MHC-II on APCs in a cascade of events that lead to effector T-helper (Th) cells. Th cells, in concert with follicular dendritic cells and recognition of cognate antigen by naive B cell can result in proliferation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells that secrete antibodies specific to the viral antigen that was initially recognized.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem, is that this process takes time to ramp up plasma cells numbers and antibody production. The average time often denoted by literature is about <strong>2 weeks<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, with adaptive immunity you get memory cells that will <em>remember<\/em> a given infection and quickly resolve it with antibodies should you ever catch the same bug.<\/p>\n\n<p>The difference between our wild type influenza and the ones in the vaccine is <strong>attenuation<\/strong>. The point of the wild type influenza people often catch is it's really good at infecting humans, and upon infection it causes a lot of damage. We can attenuate influenza's pathogenicity by growing the flu strains in tissue that is not human. Over a few generations, the virus adapts: it becomes more pathogenic/virulent in non-human tissue, but harmless to humans. You then remove the harmful parts of the hemeagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from a wild type strain to get inert HA and NA (so that you get the wild type immunogenicity), combine them with structural proteins from the attenuated strain, and combine them to form a new, live-attenuated vaccine strain that can be grown in the non-human tissue (see image below).<\/p>\n\n<p>So also keep in mind that just because your infection resolved in under 2 weeks that the antibodies you produced wont help you from getting the same bug again. During flu season it tends to come at your from all sides and the antibodies that evetually get produced help a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rE9QG.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rE9QG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":42980,"question_id":42977,"up_vote_count":13},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFhME.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19277,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19277/iayork","reputation":1582,"display_name":"iayork"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1454526564,"creation_date":1454526564,"body":"<p>Here's a short and simplified explanation.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The antibodies that arise in a flu infection are more \"intended\" to prevent future infections than to clear the present infection. <\/li>\n<li>Infections drive T cell responses as well as antibody responses, and the T cells appear a little earlier (peaking at maybe a week) and are probably very useful for clearing the present infection.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that just because we can't measure the antibodies (or T cells) doesn't mean that they're not functional.

Diseases like epilepsy can occur due various points of the sodium signaling process going wrong. It could be sodium channels are deformed and not accepting the proper signal, it could a low density of channel proteins, or it could be damage to the neuron themselves (2-4). No one has examined the \"normal/healthy range\" of sodium channels in the brain. When categorizing sodium channel deficiency scientists will often compare the number of sodium channels in a healthy brain vs. a disease brain using bioluminescence imaging or some other visualization technique. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence_imaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bioluminescence<\/a> specially quantifies the number of active sodium channels by binding causing healthy sodium channels light up and then quantifies density by the brightness of the synapse. This is not a direct quantification of the number of proteins, but I can not think of any technique that allows you to count the number of proteins on a cell without damaging the cell.

This includes a rash, high temperature,\n  loss of appetite and a general feeling of being unwell for about two\n  or three days.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Find out how to treat a high temperature in a child.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>About three to four weeks after having the MMR injection, one in 50\n  children develop a mild form of mumps. This includes swelling of the\n  glands in the cheek, neck or under the jaw, and lasts for a day or\n  two.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>One to three weeks after receiving the rubella vaccine component of\n  MMR vaccine, some adult women experience painful, stiff or swollen\n  joints, which can last for around three days. <\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rare side effects of the MMR vaccine<\/strong> <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Bruise-like spots<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In rare cases, a child may get a small rash of bruise-like spots about\n  two weeks after having the MMR vaccine. This side effect is linked to\n  the rubella vaccine and is known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic\n  purpura (ITP).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>It's been estimated that ITP develops in one in every 24,000 doses of\n  the MMR vaccine given. There is a greater risk of developing ITP from\n  measles or rubella infection than there is from having the vaccine.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>ITP usually gets better without treatment but, as with any rash, you\n  should seek advice from your GP as soon as possible. <\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Seizures (fits)<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>There is a small chance of having a seizure (fit) six to 11 days after\n  having the MMR vaccine. It sounds alarming, but it's rare, and only\n  happens in only about one in every 1,000 doses. In fact, MMR-related\n  seizures are less frequent than seizures that occur as a direct result\n  of a measles infection. <\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>In extremely rare cases, a child can have a severe allergic reaction\n  (known medically as anaphylaxis) immediately after having the MMR\n  vaccine. It's an alarming prospect, but if the child is treated\n  quickly, they make a full recovery. Medical staff who give vaccines\n  are trained to deal with allergic reactions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary the side-effects are mild, compared to the risks by getting these diseases. The most dangerous side-effect are allergic reactions, but since the vaccination is done by a medical doctor he can also deal quickly with such reactions.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43004,"question_id":42997,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42997/what-are-some-extreme-side-effects-of-the-mmr-vaccine","last_activity_date":1454578395,"creation_date":1454560778,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are some extreme side effects of the MMR vaccine?","body":"<p>Just wondering what the side effects MMR vaccines can cause and some of the biological pathways it affects.

The more so, as cold air (&lt; 0°C) has a low water vapor pressure, while the lung likes to have the air at body temperature and well moistened. Which means that you also loose the vaporization heat of the water. <\/p>\n\n<p>The function of moistening and heating the cold and dry air as well as recollecting some of the heat and water when breathing out is done by the nose. So the sensible (and done) thing in cold weather is to avoid breathing by mouth and instead keep your mouth shut and breathe by nose.<br>\nNevertheless, neither German nor English, nor any of the Scandinavian Germanic languages is spoken through the nose.<\/p>\n\n<p>My experience is that cold air (personal minimum: -40 °C) in the mouth is very unpleasant, and makes me cough as it is still cold when it arrives in the throat, but of course breathing out by mouth is less of a problem. But breathing out by mouth and in by nose means that the nose cannot recollect the heat and moisture from the outgoing air.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, the amount of breathing is linked rather to oxygen demand and $CO_2$ to be gotten rid of), and even the fastest speaking people I know do not get close to hyperventilation by speaking, not even speaking German or English. \nWhich means that speaking Germanic languages needs less breath to produce the sounds than what you need to breathe for physilogical reasons even at not much above base rate metabolism (sitting while talking) anyways. Which would imply that the breathing difference between Germanic and Sino-Tibetan languages would not cause an important driving force in language evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>A side point is that I don't agree with your concept of cold climate. Both Germany and England are counted as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate\" rel=\"nofollow\">temperate climate<\/a>. Actually, <a href=\"http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/weather/maps/city?LANG=en&amp;CEL=C&amp;SI=mph&amp;MAPS=over&amp;CONT=euro&amp;LAND=DL&amp;REGION=0001&amp;WMO=10637&amp;UP=0&amp;R=0&amp;LEVEL=160&amp;NOREGION=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frankfurt<\/a> has higher minimum temperature all year round than <a href=\"http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/weather/maps/city?LANG=en&amp;CEL=C&amp;SI=mph&amp;MAPS=over&amp;CONT=asie&amp;LAND=CI&amp;REGION=0026&amp;WMO=55591&amp;UP=0&amp;R=0&amp;LEVEL=160&amp;NOREGION=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lhasa<\/a> (as you mentioned <em>Tibetan<\/em> in your language family). \nAlso note that the Indo-Germanic language family covers a range of climates from tropic to polar just as the Sino-Tibetan covers some cold regions as well), so maybe language families that are spoken <em>only<\/em> in polar regions vs. such that are spoken <em>only<\/em> in tropic regions would be better to look at (see e.g. the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPrimary_Human_Language_Families_Map.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia language family map<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are probably some confounding influences that need to be taken into account. In cold weather, you do not sit or stand around chatting with people as much. And in the polar climates, historically farming has hardly been possible. So you have populations where hunting has been very important for survival, and regions with very low population density. Both mean that on average, you'll be silent instead of talking. As for having a chat with someone, you'd ask them in - or the length of the chat is limited by temperature.<br>\nWhich means that if cold is a driving force for the type of pronouciation that evolves, it would be a rather weak link. And in any case, speaking less will overcompensate all these breathing differences.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13642,"question_id":13625,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1385310817}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13625/do-people-often-blow-out-the-air-from-their-lungs-a-lot-when-living-in-the-cold","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/academia/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"academics and those enrolled in higher education","aliases":["http://academics.stackexchange.com"],"favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/academia/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/academia/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"academia","open_beta_date":1329782400,"site_state":"normal","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.academia.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.academia","name":"Academia Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=academia.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1329177600,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://academia.stackexchange.com","name":"Academia","high_resolution_icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/academia/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png","twitter_account":"StackAcademia","launch_date":1398211200},"on_date":1385189495,"question_id":14314},"last_activity_date":1454561599,"creation_date":1385174125,"answer_count":2,"title":"Do people often blow out the air from their lungs a lot when living in the cold condition to keep their lungs warm?","body":"<p>Do people often blow out the air from their lungs when living in cold climatic conditions to keep their lungs warm?<\/p>\n\n<p>I ask this question because it could connect to how people in different areas construct linguistic sounds. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the Germanic families of Language (German, English,...) use a lot of air from the lungs to construct the sound? <\/p>\n\n<p>Is that because the Europeans living in cold climate often blow out a lot of air from the lung to keep warm and as a result gradually they construct air-driven linguistic sounds?<\/p>\n\n<p>For people living in warm climates (ex: Sino-Tibetan language like Chinese, Thai), we mostly use the tongue to construct sounds, and we use very little air from our lungs to make sound.<\/p>\n\n<p>I posted this question to some forums &amp; some people said it\u2019s baloney.

What I would first recognize is that all of your current methods only work for at the small scale and that for you to purify mg quantities of DNA, you need to work with mg scale equipment.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, you should examine your \"upstream\" process. Are you doing your PCR at scale? Typically, we have scaled out by going with multiple PCR reactions rather than one large PCR reaction. Generally the reactions max out at 50uL depending on your thermocycler. If you're getting around 1ug/10uL, scale up to a 96 well plate with 50 uL reactions and get ~500 ug of material. Make sure that you mix your dNTPs! Scale-up accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<p>To start, the DNA Clean and Concentration is designed for really small reactions. It's much better to use the next level of purification by maxiprepping everything. The  The binding capacity of those columns go up to 1 mg. Using the QIAEX II slurry works but you should make sure that you scale up correctly. Make sure that you complete your regeneration. This <a href=\"http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/Molbio/Protocols/QIAQuick_recycle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">protocol<\/a> works well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can ignore the column and just ethanol precipitate everything to remove your nucleotides. I suggest following <a href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Ethanol_precipitation_of_nucleic_acids\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethanol precipitation of nucleic acids<\/a> from OWW. We had to make a lot of linear template and for most applications this works great.<\/p>\n\n<p>As with all things related to molecular biology, there is a lot of voodoo. Some things that supposively work is to chill your ethanol mixture at -20C for at least an hour (or overnight), generally, you'll see your DNA fall out of solution and that's your sign that things are working. At this scale you should be seeing your DNA pellet; that's a good sign if things are working. While eluting anything from the columns, we would warm up our elution buffers. Thermodynamically this would make sense since it would reduce the barrier for unbinding. You would also get away with a lower residence time.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would frankly avoid using FPLC unless you're working with gram quantities of DNA.

Perhaps because \"inside\" is indeed an imprecise term (but now it is history and cannot be changed ;) ). In order to understand it a bit better it helps to think about the topology of the membrane. During synthesis most membrane proteins (ignoring peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins, which are a whole other topic) are inserted into the ER membrane by the Sec translocon. The parts of the membrane protein that are exposed to the lumen are matured by the ER and Golgi apparatus to be presented on the extracellular surface. Secretory proteins (those that will ultimately be exported from the cell) are made in similar way except they pass entirely through the translocon and end up in the ER lumen. Therefore, the lumen of the ER (and consequently the lumen of other endomembrane compartments) are topologically consistent with the extracellular space, \"outside\", and not the \"inside\" of the cell. Perhaps is is easiest to see in a picture (borrowed from here: <a href=\"http://www.bioon.com/book/biology/mboc/chapter12/figure12-4.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bioon.com/book/biology/mboc/chapter12/figure12-4.gif<\/a>)<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9LVA.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9LVA.gif\" alt=\"Cell membrane topology\"><\/a>\nColoured in pink are compartments whose topology is consistent with the \"outside\" and coloured grey are compartments whose topology is consistent with the \"inside\". So, for membrane proteins found in the endosome, for example, amino acid residues in the lumen are actually \"outside\" not \"inside\". It is true that this may not be immediately clear to those not steeped deeply in the field. As the initial studies used bacteria, which do not have membrane-enclosed subcellular compartments, \"inside\" was simple and made sense. Perhaps \"positive-in-the-cytoplasm rule\" would have been more accurate.

While the Y chromosome is the most easily discerned, a paternal X chromosome could also be detected because in that case the cell free DNA would contain fragments of three distinct X chromosomes.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/139.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">This publication<\/a> summarizes the issue nicely:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once the cell-free DNA fragments have been purified, small differences\n  between the fetal and maternal DNA sequences are exploited in order to\n  make a specific fetal diagnosis. To date, the majority of studies have\n  focused on the detection of paternally inherited sequences that are\n  entirely absent from the maternal genotype, such as those on the Y\n  chromosome of male fetuses. This target is particularly attractive as it\n  comprises a large portion of DNA which is not otherwise present in \n  women.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Variable regions of repeated DNA (short tandem repeats or\n  STRs) can be used to identify paternally inherited sequences, by comparing\n  the number of repeats present with the paternal and maternal sequences.\n  Paternal alleles on the autosomal chromosomes can also be detected, if\n  they are known to be absent in the maternal genome, but this requires\n  detailed sequence knowledge of the paternal genotype of interest, as\n  well as detection methods that can distinguish DNA sequences that\n  might only differ by a single nucleotide. Importantly, all these methods\n  rely upon the fetus inheriting a uniquely paternal sequence that is conveniently\n  located for a particular diagnosis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The reliability of these tests can apparently be improved by enriching the fetal cell free DNA:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selective enrichment of fetal DNA, based on a difference in the\n  average physical length of fetal and maternal DNA fragments, which\n  can be exploited to increase the relative amount of cffDNA. Fetally\n  derived DNA fragments are generally smaller than those that are\n  maternally derived, being predominantly ,313 base-pairs in length\n  (Chan et al., 2004). Therefore, by using standard size fractionation\n  to select only DNA fragments ,300 base-pairs, circulating cffDNA\n  can be enriched such that it comprises around 70% of the total cellfree\n  DNA (Li et al., 2004b), prior to detection and identification by\n  either PCR (Li et al., 2005) or mass spectrometry (Li et al., 2006).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":42947,"question_id":42901,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42901/how-does-a-test-like-the-natera-panorama-distinguish-the-childs-genome-from-the","last_activity_date":1454445763,"creation_date":1454345539,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does a test like the Natera Panorama distinguish the child's genome from the mother?","body":"<p>Blood tests on an expectant mother, like the <a href=\"http://www.panoramatest.com/en/expecting-parents/common-questions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natera Panorama<\/a>, are now being used regularly to screen fetuses for chromosome abnormalities.

I understand some of the science of how such a test could be performed. When the placenta implants, some of the fetal cells get into the mother's bloodstream, and even though the chromosomes from those cells are breaking down, these pieces can be scanned for the markers for genetic disorders and gender.

I can see that after determining the mother's genome, it could be determined if there was no evidence of an X or Y from the father. But how would they know if an X was not contributed by the mother.

Lets assume the pathway is linear i.e. no branches. The net flux would be limited by the slowest enzyme in the pathway. If a mutation increases activity of the rate limiting enzyme-1 while another mutation reduces the activity of enzyme-2 then the net flux may not change.<\/li>\n<li>If a regulatory gene acts on another gene by some kind of molecular recognition (protein-DNA, protein-RNA, RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, protein-protein), then the effect of a mutation in the recognition domain in the regulator can be complemented by another mutation in the target such that the binding affinity is preserved. For e.g. a miRNA regulating a mRNA. If a mutation in miRNA, A→G, is compensated by a mutation, U→C, in the target, then there may be no change in the molecular phenotype. This logic also applies for two gene products that function as a heterodimer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>However, different mutations in the same gene may also lead to complementation like effect.

Two mutations can preserve the intramolecular interaction in a manner similar to the case of intermolecular interactions discussed above. <\/p>\n\n<p>For case-2 you can imagine a gene-product that functions as a homodimer. If the two mutations preserve the intermolecular interactions in the dimer then you would see complementation.

In the case of <em>Ophyocordiceps unilateralis<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3204140/\">(Evans, 2011)<\/a>, the spores lodge themselves into the ant's head through an exposed part of the ant\u2019s exoskeleton. The fungus then <strong>infiltrates<\/strong> and <strong>targets the ant\u2019s brain<\/strong>, <strong>taking control of the ant<\/strong>. Then it makes the ant leave its colony and head for a leaf that provides the ideal conditions for the fungus to grow. The ant crawls under the leaf and goes into a \u201cdeath grip\u201d\u2014biting down hard on the leaf's major veins. This allows the fungus to slowly feed on it. When the fungus finishes growing, it eventually kills the ant and releases its spores (Source: <a href=\"http://smithsonianscience.si.edu/2015/02/science-zombies-already-walk-among-us/\">Smithsonian<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is that the zombie ant not only provides <strong>shade and humidity<\/strong> when hanging under the leaf, it is also positioned <strong>directly on top of the ant\u2019s colony<\/strong>, so when the spores burst out they fall on other ants and begin the cycle all over again. There are hundreds of mind-controlling fungi like this one, but the chances of this type of parasitoid fungus evolving to target humans as hosts are unlikely (Source: <a href=\"http://smithsonianscience.si.edu/2015/02/science-zombies-already-walk-among-us/\">Smithsonian<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3204140/\">Evans, <em>Commun Integr Biol<\/em> (2011); <strong>4<\/strong>(5): 598\u2013602<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":42746,"question_id":42745,"up_vote_count":53,"last_edit_date":1454015113},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":8,"post_id":42767,"edited":false,"creation_date":1454042026,"comment_id":73670,"body":"Even the rabies virus is a good example in case of animals."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyv6J.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16039,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16039/kryan","reputation":101,"display_name":"KRyan"},"score":3,"post_id":42767,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1454078778,"comment_id":73698,"body":"@WYSIWYG Rabies is very likely a major source for various \u201cpeople turning into monsters\u201d folklore, like zombies or werewolves.

(2006)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In many cases the final interactions, or endgames, between a host and pathogen involve complex behavioral modifications such as the infected insect seeking an elevated position where wind currents can effectively disseminate conidia. Elevation seeking by insects at late stages of infection is a common phenomenon that was recognized by early insect pathologists who noted that diseased lepidopteran larvae, such as Lymantria monacha (the nun moth), infected with baculoviruses migrated to the tops of trees where they died (94). This host-altered behavior was named \u201cWipfelkrankheit\u201d or \u201cWipfelsucht\u201d (meaning tree top disease in German) for viral diseases (41) and \u201csummit disease\u201d for fungal diseases (24, 57, 106).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Overall, lots of information about the behavioural modifications of hosts caused by fungi and viruses can be found in <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150941\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"BIZARRE INTERACTIONS AND ENDGAMES: Entomopathogenic Fungi and Their Arthropod Hosts&quot;.

In another interesting example a parasitic wasp might use a viral infection to control the behaviour of its host, so that the the host beetle is paralysed and is \"guarding\" the larvae and pupa after the parasitic larvae has emerged from the beetle (see <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1803/20142773\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dheilly et al, 2015<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/wasp-virus-turns-ladybugs-zombie-babysitters\" rel=\"nofollow\">a popular account in Science<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<h3>References:<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Roy et al. 2006. <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150941\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"BIZARRE INTERACTIONS AND ENDGAMES: Entomopathogenic Fungi and Their Arthropod Hosts&quot;.

What is amazing here is that the phage has certain genes that are required for photosynthesis within its genome.  Why does it have these?  The phage extends the life of its host in order to maximize its replication.  It has been shown that while the host metabolism is all but shut down, phage genes for photosynthesis are still being expressed at high levels, giving the phage 'bonus time' to replicate.  Ok so the virus in question here is the reason for the death of the host in the first place.  Also, the host is not exactly living normally during this 'bonus level' of life, as the phage is only trying to produce more of itself.\nOne can imagine however, that in single celled organisms (for simplicity), a lysogenic phage (one that sits in the genome of its host and waits for the proper conditions to jump out and replicate), could theoretically bring back the organism from death, if it encodes the precise biochemical pathway that was shut down in the first place.  Think of a cell that has lost some necessary gene that is essential to its survival in a given environment.  This new mutation (perhaps because of UV light) would surely kill this cell.  If the cellular components necessary for survival remain intact, and a phage encoding this biochemical pathway (this gene) and the components to express it (yes viruses have many of these genes too), it is conceivable that this cell could return to a metabolically normal state, ie living.

This means these individuals have bigger chances of reproducing, which means spread of the alele. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sickle cell anaemia is one good example in countries with big incidence of malaria (caused by a protista <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum\" rel=\"nofollow\">plasmodium falciparum<\/a>). This parasite reproduces itself in human Red Blood Cells (RBCs), destroys the cells and releases its sporozoits (which can infect other RBCs and the cycle continues). This massive destruction of RBCs is called haemolytic anaemia. Without enough RBCs and haemoglobin, the organism isn't able to function properly (falls ill in malaria).<\/p>\n\n<p>Individuals which are <strong>heterozygous<\/strong> for HbS alele (which in homozygous state causes sickle-cell anaemia) <strong>can<\/strong> catch the parasite, but the chances are bigger, that the infected cells will be phagocytized by macrophages and the parasite will be unable to reproduce in them. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/figure/f1-mjhid-4-1-065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illustration<\/a> Therefore the chances are bigger that they will survive the infection by plasmodium, therefore they can pass their genes (containing HbS gene to the next generation. (The whole process is a bit more complicated by presence of other genes, some details can be found <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>, but this mechanism seems to be the most important one.)<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, many homozygots for \"normal\" Hb alele die as a result of malaria infection, most homozygots for HbS alele die for sickle-cell anaemia. So the <strong>winner is heterozygous<\/strong> conformation, which is saved from both. This influences the frequency of HbS alele (it makes it higher until this effect gets balanced with the effect of selection against HbS alele because of too many homozygous individuals with sickle-cell anaemia)<\/p>\n\n<p>Another good examples in European population are heterozygozity for CFTR mutated alele, which helps during epidemics of cholera. Vibrio cholerae which causes this disease modifies the effects of G protein pathway for release of some ions (and water) into the lumen of intestine, which causes massive diarrhea. Specific mutations in CFTR gene deplete its function (the transport of Cl-) which in heterozygous conformation lowers the loss of water, which is the main cause of death in cholera, therefore helps the individuals to survive. Homozygous conformation however results in cystic fibrosis. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. :)<\/p>\n","answer_id":42884,"question_id":42881,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1454280645}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42881/why-do-heterozygous-individuals-have-increased-resistance-to-malaria","last_activity_date":1454361308,"creation_date":1454277541,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do heterozygous individuals have increased resistance to malaria?","body":"<p>I am aware that there is such a thing called <em>heterozygous advantage<\/em>, which is due to the presence of a certain single allele, and that an example of this could be with \"sickle-cell anemia\".
