Often, if an addict receives a stimulation without a drug they are, at first, excited, calm, or feeling whatever the drug effects caused. But then, if no drug is received, the withdrawal effects come into play and makes the addict feel worse and crave the drug more intensely. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, so when you see something you associate with being gross or awful, your bodies physical reaction is essentially prepping you for the event.The biological and cellular effects of associative learning are regulated in the central nervous system (brain). The main theory is that the initial effect of the stimulus is regulated by dopaminergic channels, and the learning and associations are regulated by serotonergic channels. However, it is more like a complex network of synaptic channels at work in various parts of the brain. The regions known to be apart of associative learning are the emotional cortex of the brain are the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. <\/p>\n\n<p>For gastrointestinal upset the stimulus is most likely associated with an event that caused GI upset previously. For example, let's say you went out to a party and had too much to drink. You throw up everything you've eaten that day and you just generally feel awful and 'sick to your stomach.' Now, every time you see, smell, or taste that brand or flavor of alcohol you consumed, you immediately gag because your body is remembering the previous event and associates that stimulus with the vomiting and sick feeling. Does that make sense? Let me know if you would like more clarification.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBNK.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drug Addiction Drug Habituation - Profiles in Science<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4321.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Control of cocaine-seeking behavior by drug-associated stimuli in rats: Effects on recovery of extinguished operant-responding and extracellular dopamine levels in amygdala and nucleus accumbens<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438804000364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neural and psychological mechanisms underlying appetitive learning: links to drug addiction<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Physcopharmacology by: Meyer and Quenzer (ISBN 978-0-87893-510-9) (best source)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":41587,"question_id":41576,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1450361784}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41576/why-do-you-retch-when-you-see-something-disgusting","last_activity_date":1450366776,"creation_date":1450302159,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do you retch when you see something disgusting?","body":"<p>Why do you retch when you see something disgusting?<\/p>\n\n<p>I imagine it is some sort of evolutionary response, although I can't see the connection between receiving a signal that unhealthy conditions are in the current environment and wanting to empty the contents of one's stomach, which likely were eaten elsewhere.

Massive dopamine release, e.g. through cocaïne or meth intake, results in euphoria <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2893431\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Wise &amp; Bozarth, 1985)<\/a>. When the drug's effects wear off it is followed by the 'crash', characterized by dysphoria and a longing for more drugs <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64328/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(CSAT, 1999)<\/a>. Gambling addiction works much in the same way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Addiction develops because of an interplay of <strong><a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/alcohol-substance-dependence-symptoms/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dependence<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/alcohol-substance-dependence-symptoms/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tolerance<\/a><\/strong>. <strong>Dependence<\/strong> is caused by downregulation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic\" rel=\"nofollow\">dopaminergic<\/a> responses in the reward centers. Notably, dopamine receptors are downregulated when dopamine agonists like <a href=\"http://www.addictionrecov.org/Addictions/?AID=32\" rel=\"nofollow\">stimulant drugs<\/a> of abuse are chronically administered. Downregulation of dopaminergic responses causes the physiology of the reward pathway to adapt to the presence of dopamine agonists. While the drug is in the system, everything is OK. However, once the levels of the dopamine agonist wears off, the body enters a state of lack of dopaminergic responses, causing dysphoria and depression. <strong>Tolerance<\/strong> develops as the liver and other tissues start breaking down the drug more efficiently due to upregulation of the necessary catabolic enzymes. Hence, more of the drug is needed, and the user becomes more and more tolerant. The interplay of dependence and tolerance form the dreaded vicious, downward spiral of addiction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reward centers have been crucial in evolution, as they provide motivation to vital acts of life, including eating and sex (<a href=\"http://ibg.colorado.edu/cadd1/a_drug/essays/essay4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Colorado, Boulder<\/a>). Without a proper reward system, why eat or reproduce? However, drugs and other addictive acts such as gambling also activate the reward system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Highly purified drugs such as crystal meth and cocaïne result in massive dopamine release that is unparalleled by normal physiologic processes such as eating. Before the occurrence of stimulants and things like gambling, the reward system was nothing but essential to life and evolution. Now, things are different and man needs to adapt to these novel, artificial pleasures in life.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64328/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series, No. 33.

More about sleep in honeybees can be found in this paper by <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255718730_4._Eban-Rothschild_A._D._Bloch_G._(2012)_Circadian_Rhythms_and_Sleep_in_Honey_Bees_chapter_1.3._p._31-46_in__Honeybee_Neurobiology_and_Behavior/file/50463520692ec8d481.pdf\">Eban-Rothschild and Block (2012)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I did not find anything on sleeping in ants after a brief Google Scholar search but ants and bees are both hymenopterans, so it's reasonable to hypothesize that many of the effects of sleep (and sleep deprivation) found in bees could also apply to ants. The Eban-Rothschild and Block paper linked above has some comparisons of circadian rhythms between ants and bees before discussing sleep as a function of circadian rhythms.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21160,"question_id":21159,"up_vote_count":31},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQ33X.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9167,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9167/roland","reputation":596,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":48,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00c5384c01d44ec1bbc4c035638c3042?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1658,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1658/yo","reputation":133,"display_name":"yo'"},"score":18,"post_id":21163,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410269828,"comment_id":33179,"body":"Interesting, a queen gets 9 hours of sleep, a worker only 4.5 hours..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":6,"post_id":21163,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410270090,"comment_id":33180,"body":"Here&#39;s a <a href=\"http://www.dormivigilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/sleep-in-ants.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">more accessible<\/a> copy of the Cassill paper.

There are some experimental evidences, but it is difficult to put things togheter. It is now clear that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Mechanism_of_action\" rel=\"nofollow\"> paracetamol acts <\/a>contemporaneously via at least three pathways:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The inhibition of cyclo-oxigenase (COX)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The main mechanism proposed is the inhibition of COX, <a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/22/2/383.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">it's highly selective for COX-2.<\/a><br>\nCOX are molecules involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (aa). It catalyzes the reaction to form prostaglandin H2, a pro-inflammatory compound, from aa. \nParacetamol, as other NSAIDs, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16413237\" rel=\"nofollow\"> block this step <\/a>, thus reduce the amount of prostaglandin H2. The reduced amount of prostaglandin H2 in the CNS, lowers the hypothalamic set-point in the thermoregulatory centre.<\/p>\n\n<p>The exact mechanisms by which COX is inhibited in various circumstances are still a subject of discussion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some authors state that paracetamol works by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC129799/%0A\" rel=\"nofollow\">inhibiting the COX-3 isoform\u2014a COX-1 splice variant\u2014of the COX family of enzymes.<\/a><br>\nThis variant is expressed mostly in brain, so it is the one supposed to be involved in the antalgic effect of this compound.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is another physiopathologic possibility to explain its action, that is: paracetamol would block COX, but in an inflammatory environment where the concentration of peroxides is high, paracetamol itself is oxydated and thus inactive. When it founds a non inflammatory environment, such as CNS, it become reduced and thus active (it reduces temperature, it has anti-dolorific action, etc).<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The modulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system, through its metabolite AM404, a compound that inhibits the reuptake of the endogenous cannabinoid/vanilloid anandamide by neurons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The COX model can explain quite well the action of paracetamol, altought it has been demonstrated an important role of the endocannabinoid system aside of COX. When cannabinoid receptors are blocked with synthetic antagonists, paracetamol's analgesic effects are prevented. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987694\" rel=\"nofollow\"> This is tought to be due by an active metabolite of paracetamol<\/a>, that is called AM404 and inhibits the reuptake of anandamide.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anandamide reuptake lowers synaptic levels of anandamide. This results in a more activated pain receptor (at least the main one, called TRPV1, or according to an old nomenclature: vanilloid receptor). The high levels of anandamine, due to inhibition of its reuptake, desensitise this receptor in a way similar to the capsaicine.\nFurthermore, this active metabolite (AM404) inhibits sodium channels, this chemical behaviour is shared with lidocaine and procaine, two common anesthetic drugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>These two actions by themselves have been shown to reduce pain, and are a possible explanation of paracetamol's mechanism of action; but one other specific activity of this compound remains unexplained by these two models.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Serotonin receptor agonism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It has been observed that this compound can reduce the social rejection in humans. This can't be explained with COX or type I endocannabinoid system modulation.\nIncrease of social behavior in mice dosed with paracetamol, wich models a reduction of social rejection response in humansdoes not appear to be due to cannabinoid receptor type 1 activity. .\nIn the animal model, it seems a result from <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389197/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> serotonin receptor agonism.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aside of this main features, some other evidences are in bibliography.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In 2011 a debate started on scientific journals. Some has found <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22109525\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a hint to the analgesic mechanism of paracetamol<\/a>, being that the metabolites of paracetamol e.g. NAPQI, act on TRPA1-receptors in the spinal cord to suppress the signal transduction from the superficial layers of the dorsal horn, to alleviate pain. \nThis findings has been contested in a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/aclaesson/paracetamol-mechanism-on-slide-share-39192733\" rel=\"nofollow\"> new hypothesis paper <\/a> on how paracetamol might act. \nThis second study concedes that NAPQI is the active metabolite but that this reactive compound should react not only with the thiol in TRPA1 but also with any other suitably available nucleophile that it happens to encounter. This broad interaction with thiol groups in cysteine proteases, like the ones that process <a href=\"http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=procytokines\" rel=\"nofollow\"> procytokines<\/a>, might be the targets giving rise to overall analgesic effects, changing the global cytokyne environment. \nEven if there are evidences of drug-body interaction with formation of active metabolites and there are some models of drug action, many things are not fully cleared and the debate is still open.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why are they a popular theory?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Are popular because are based on experimental and clinical evidence. Also, this theories can model lot of the biological effects of this compound.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which protein is targeted?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Not any time it can be possible to reduce a pharmacological interaction at this level. For instance, in one theory it inhibits an enzyme, the cyclooxygenase (COX); in one other model entire classes of molecules, the sodium channels, are modulated...\nUnfortunately many times, dealing with living organisms, it is not possible  to offer an hard, mechanicistic explanation of things.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How does that inhibition introduce the analgesic and antipyretic properties?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the COX inhibition model, the analgesic properties can be explained trough an affinity for COX3; and the antipyretic activity can be due to the reduced amount of prostaglandin E2 in the CNS, in the thermoregulatory centre it lowers the hypothalamic set-point. The endocannabinoid model can explain preety well the anti dolorific actions, as well as the serotonin receptor interaction the behavioral one.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it possible multiple theories are correct?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, there is a substantial overlap between different regulatory systems, so that is straight to think that the same chemical (or some of its different active metabolites) can modulate different systems.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is so little known about paracetamol?

If you mean direct targeting then there are assays to verify it.<\/p>\n\n<p>To verify if the miRNA can potentially target the mRNA independently, what is routinely done is a reporter downregulation assay (usually luciferase). You clone the 3'UTR of your target mRNA downstream of the reporter gene and check the activity of luciferase in the presence and absence of miRNA. You do that by co-transfecting the miRNA and the luciferase construct, collecting the cell lysate after some time (typically 12/24/36h post transfection) and measuring luciferase activity using bioluminescence counter. This just establishes the molecular possibility of targeting but does not really say if the same actually happens in a given tissue. <\/p>\n\n<p>Reporter assays like this can be modified for in-vivo conditions too. Express the reporter-3'UTR construct in your organism (or specific tissue). Use another reporter with a mutated target site in the 3'UTR which abolishes miRNA targeting and compare the activities of the two. In zebrafish, people also use modified-backbone oligonucleotides (morpholinos) to mask the target site such that the miRNA can no longer target the mRNA. This assay is called <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2011.423\" rel=\"nofollow\">target-protection assay<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are other assays which do not involve reporter genes but actually capture miRNA and mRNA bound to the Ago-complex. This is done by protein-RNA crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation of the protein (Ago) which is then followed by sequencing of the bound RNA. See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/23501/3340\">this<\/a> post for more details. These assays will give you tissue specific information but they only tell you if a miRNA and mRNA are bound together. They do not tell whether the mRNA activity is downregulated or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Targeting of the mRNA by miRNA, in-vivo (which has already been established by ectopic reporter assays) depends on many factors, the foremost of which is the relative concentrations of these molecules and the competitors. To produce an effect, the miRNA has to be in sufficient concentration for each of its target (if the miRNA has many targets then the per-target availability will go down). <\/p>\n\n<p>So, if a miRNA-X actually targets i.e. downregulates a mRNA-Y in a specific condition, it need not do it in another condition. However, we would still say that mRNA-Y is a valid target of miRNA-X if it is so in at least one condition and better if it has been validated using reporter assays (ectopic). <\/p>\n","answer_id":41399,"question_id":41390,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1449866200},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59c64d3bd0350f01b9dbaafd4b988f72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8026,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8026/jitz","reputation":53,"display_name":"JITZ"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":41425,"edited":false,"creation_date":1449866035,"comment_id":70292,"body":"miRNA hardly ever cause positive regulation.

There may be actually potential benefits to perpetual liquid ventilation for people with disease. Trials so far have not found side effects in fluorocarbon liquid breathing.<\/p>\n\n<p>So lets talk about the history of liquid breathing and case studies, then we will move onto the hypothetical situation of liquid breathing indefinitely.<\/p>\n\n<p>A great review (Shaffer <em>et al<\/em>, 1992) covers the field in great depth.<\/p>\n\n<p>@MCM pointed out in the comments that my original answer did no emphasise that animal diaphragms are not powerful enough to move the liquid in and out of the lungs. I should mention now that the below cases all use ventilators to pump the fluid into and out of the lungs. The difficulty of breathing this without a ventilator is emphasised by <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/david_blaine_how_i_held_my_breath_for_17_min?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Blaine at 4:54 in this TED talk<\/a> who said it was like trying to breath with an elephant standing on your chest.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Case studies.<\/h1>\n\n<p>As early as the 1920s, poisonous gas research that lead to the infamous mustard gas found that lungs could tolerate large quantities of saline briefly without damage.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Animals.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Kylstra, the first pioneer introducing the idea of land animals breathing liquids (Kylstra <em>et al.,<\/em> 1962, found mice could withstand 4 hours of 160 atmospheres of pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clark found that mice and rats could breathe oxygen bubbled silicone oils and survive for a few hours after emersion.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1965, he discovered that the fluorocarbon known as FC75 not only supported respiration during total immersion but the mice <strong>survived indefinitely in apparent good health.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The most recent study I can find is the partial use of fluorocarbon liquid ventilation in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of rabbits. The same improvements in breathing were not observed in saline liquid breathing or conventional ventilators.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Humans.<\/h3>\n\n<p>In humans PFCs were first used successfully in 1989 for the ventilation of young infants near death.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Marked improvement in lung compliance, without a compromise of cardiovascular status\n  was noted in all three patients. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All three infants died of their severe respiratory complications, but the trial showed liquid breathing can support gas exchange in humans. However developing lungs of infants cannot rely on mechanical ventilators for prolonged periods as nearly a quarter of premature infants of those that do later developed chronic breathing problems. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Biomedical application.<\/h3>\n\n<p>There are a fair few researches and doctors who believe fluorocarbon liquid ventilation has some advantages over gas ventilation. It reduces stress at the area of interfacial surface tension in the distressed, surfactant-deficient lung. This would be ideal and appropriate for ARDS in human adults. A more sophisticated use would be using fluorocarbons as a drug delivery system straight to damaged lung tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>(All the above can be found in the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/ppul.1950140208/asset/1950140208_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=i56t8bq6&amp;s=159dd8f9de838c216066607ce22a03bf16bf0092\" rel=\"nofollow\">1992 review.<\/a> There is also data on the different properties of suitable FCs)<\/p>\n\n<h1>Real world potential.<\/h1>\n\n<p><strong><em>Is perpetual liquid breathing possible? ...And healthy?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So this is where we stand with the case studies; Mice can breath liquids indefinitely and stay in good health, rabbits with ARDS survive where breathable gas would not help, and there is a contingency in the biomedical community that it can be better than gas ventilation for medical treatment. To me it seems that there is nothing to suggest a fully grown adult would suffer from breathing liquids.

I am going to provide you with an answer that will be based on your comment that you would like an answer from a beginners perspective. <\/p>\n\n<p>For simplicity sake I will keep the answer to humans as the host organism, though pretty much any multicellular organism can act as a host for microscopic organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: A number or the references I use come from Janeway's Immunobiology. The links provided are to the 2001 edition that is on the NCBI bookshelf. The issue, however, is that over the past decade we have learned a great deal more about the immune system since then, and some of the things I refer to were not represented in that edition of the text.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do intestinal fauna have the same DNA as their host?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The short answer to this question is no. Also, we generally identify microbes of this nature as flora instead of fauna, so you would say intestinal flora.<\/p>\n\n<p>The human microbiome (microbiota), as it is often referred to, is made up of hundreds of trillions of microorganisms that live in the niche of our digestive tract, airways, urogenital tract, and skin. In fact, the estimate is that there are 10 times as many microbial cells that live on the human body than there are human cells that make up the body itself <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-human-microbiome-project-defines-normal-bacterial-makeup-body\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1)<\/a>. The difference is that human cells are immense when compared to most of the microbial cells that colonize us <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cell_Biology/Introduction/Cell_size\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of the microorganisms that populate us are single-celled organisms, such as bacteria or fungi (yeasts). Each of these cells is its own entity, in other words is an independent living organism, and they have their own genome (the complete genetic material of an organism) that encodes for their own proteins. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is a good reference tool, though maybe a little advanced from The University of Utah, <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Human Microbiome<\/a>. <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiome/friends/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This interactive presentation<\/a> gives a layman's overview. The American Museum of Natural History has also curated an exhibit called <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/the-secret-world-inside-you\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Secret World Inside You<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To add a point for clarification, while the genetic codes of these microbes are different in different species and are different from that of the human host, the molecules that hold the information, namely DNA, are all made of the same nucleic acid building blocks <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/genetic-code-13\" rel=\"nofollow\">(5)<\/a>. To use an analogy, it is like using the same letters but writing in two different languages. We may use mostly the same characters, but the way we arrange those letters to form words in Spanish or words in English create different meaning.<\/p>\n\n<p>When these single-celled organisms reproduce, they copy their own DNA and they divide into two new cells, each receiving one copy of that DNA <a href=\"https://micro.cornell.edu/research/epulopiscium/binary-fission-and-other-forms-reproduction-bacteria\" rel=\"nofollow\">(6)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since yeast and other fungi are evolutionarily closer ancestors to humans than are bacteria, some of their genes, the sections of DNA that are functional and encode for proteins and RNAs, have a very similar sequence to our own (referred to as having homology) and often perform similar or the same function <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/humans-share-many-genes-yeast-billions-years-after-evolution-1502458\" rel=\"nofollow\">(7)<\/a>. When this is the case, we say that the genes are evolutionarily conserved, but for the most part evolutionarily conserved genes will vary in sequence from organism to organism, and the variation will usually increase the farther back you go in order to find a common ancestor between the organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>The human body is made up of about 37.2 trillion cells, on average <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-are-372-trillion-cells-in-your-body-4941473/?no-ist\" rel=\"nofollow\">(8)<\/a>. Almost all of these cells, with the exception of Red Blood Cells, have a copy of the hosts genome <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2597123/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(9)<\/a>. All of these cells arose from a single egg produced by the mother and fertilized by the father's sperm <a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/human-embryonic-development#video-7b9676a4-5f24-4837-9aaf-9352eed43c1e\" rel=\"nofollow\">(10)<\/a>. The egg and the sperm contained half the genome necessary for the embryo to develop. The DNA from the mother and the DNA from the father come together when the nuclei fuse. So we have our own genome that came from our mother and father, and the microbes have their own genome which they inherited from the ancestral cells that gave rise to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>That is a slightly simplified answer as there can be different ways that the DNA can be passed between the organisms, <strong>but for the most part, we have our own DNA and, even though they live on us and in us, the microbes have their own DNA<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your first paragraph.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I cannot tell you necessarily why seed that we swallow and digest do not germinate inside of us. It is likely that the seeds are not receiving the proper signals from the environment of our digestive track to initiate the genetic program to begin germination and development into a plant.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I also heard that the immune system uses the same technique to detect intruders (and subsequently attack donor-organs).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The vertebrate immune system is a diverse, highly-tuned system of surveillance that monitors for pathogens or foreign bodies that are introduced into the body that may be dangerous to the survival of the organism <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2388/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(11)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For humans, the first set of defense are barrier defenses <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(12)<\/a>. The surface of our skin consists of several layers of dead, keratinized cells that form an impermeable barrier. As long as this layer is not breached, it does an excellent job of keeping yeast and bacteria outside, away from tissue that they could damage. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the interior surfaces, our airways, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tracts contain specialized cells that produce large amounts of mucus that will coat the surfaces of these tissue. Mucus serves multiple roles. First it keeps the tissue moist, so that it does not dehydrate. Next it keeps the microbes at a distance from our cells, so that they do not come in direct contact with our epithelial cells (The cells that make up the linings of our digestive tract, genitourinary tract, and airways). Third, it can trap microbes in it. The epithelium is able to \"sweep\" the mucus along and as a result it is able to clear bacteria out of the body <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27169/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(13)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Included in the barrier defenses are actually the microbial organisms themselves. The interaction between the host and an organism which is neither detrimental or actively beneficial is known as <strong>commensalism<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27169/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(13)<\/a>. Basically, all of these trillions of microorganisms that life on us do not hurt us. In return, they get an environment in which they can live. As a result of this, commensal organisms will grow on these surfaces, will take up all of the space, and will use up the nutrients that could be used by pathogenic organisms (organisms that are actively able to cause an infection) to establish an infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next level of defense comes from the cells of the innate immune system <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27090/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(14)<\/a>. In innate immunity, specialized cells monitor the area they are in for Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs can be sugars that make up the cell walls of the microbe or proteins that get expressed on the surface of the organism, such as Flagellin, a protein only found in the flagella of certain pathogen. The innate immune cells have pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that have a general specificity for recognizing and responding to the PAMPs. Our cells even have PRRs for DNA and Double Stranded RNA's, however those are usually found in vesicles on the inside of the cell. These interactions are very general, however once PRRs bind to the PAMP, they are able to signal into the cytoplasm, which can lead to the production of proteins, among other possible responses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here you can think of PRRs like a motion detector in a security system; the dog, or your two year old, or an intruder are going to set off the alarm just the same. It is not specific. The motion sensor \"knows\" that something that it is supposed to recognize, i.e. a moving object larger than a mouse passed by and it triggered the response, but it cannot tell you which moving object triggered it, only that it was triggered.<\/p>\n\n<p>The innate immune cells are also able to respond by \"eating\" the pathogen in a process called phagocytosis. Here, they break up the bacteria, yeast, or the remnants of other dead host cells or large pathogens, things like worms, and put the broken up pieces on protein molecules on their surface. <\/p>\n\n<p>When innate immune cells do this, they are presenting molecules to specialized immune cells (adaptive immune cells <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27090/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(14)<\/a>), B-Cells and T-Cells, that are highly specific as to what they will react to. These cells can also cause a lot of damage to the host, so they are tightly regulated. Think of the interactions as keys and locks. A protein from a bacteria should turn a few of these cells on, but a protein from the host should not fit the lock.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of these immune cells also respond to diffused chemical signals called cytokines. These molecules are secreted by some cells and are received by receptors on the host cells. Sometimes the secretion is by another immune cell, sometimes it is from a non-immune system host cell, and sometimes these molecules can be secreted by the bacteria, fungi, or worms themselves. <\/p>\n\n<p>Depending on the chemical signals that are secreted, and how the cells are interacting at the time of the message, and which cells are receiving the message, will determine the response to the message. It is contextual. Think of the phrase \"You're killing me.\" If someone says it, while laughing, to a good friend who is telling jokes, it means one thing. If it is screamed as someone is being choked by an attacker, it means something very different.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize, the immune cells are surveilling the environment and trying to pick up what is friend and what is foe and they try to respond accordingly.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Over time and coevolution, our microbiomes have developed ways of communicating with our immune system to let it know that these microbes do not mean any harm. They are able to \"train\" the immune cells using chemical signaling to temper the immune systems response to them <a href=\"http://microbiome%20training%20of%20immune%20cells\" rel=\"nofollow\">(15)<\/a>, and this is how they are able to coexist within our body and with an immune system that is constantly on seek an destroy missions. Also because of the mucus, our microbiome usually isn't in direct contact with our cells, so it is a different kind of interaction than if an infecting pathogen were to breech the barriers and gain access to sterile areas where no bacteria or fungi should be found, and as a result, the immune system reacts differently.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for organ and tissue rejections <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000815.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">(16)<\/a>, the issue here is that each of our cells, except for Red Blood Cells, present molecules on their surface that identify it as being a cell that was made by the body itself. You can almost think of it as a sport's teams jersey. The immune cells can survey the proteins displayed on the surface of our cells and tell that they are ours instead of from a pathogen. The problem is that each person makes a different array of these proteins, so if I were to give you a kidney, the proteins that the cells from my kidney make and put on their surface for immune cells to look at will be different from yours. In this case, because the keys <strong>do not<\/strong> fit the locks, the immune system reacts to the donated organ as an intruder and begins to attack it. Immune cells are extremely lethal and will kill the donated organ if they are not suppressed. That is why transplant recipients need to have their immune systems suppressed in order to survive with the donated organ. You might ask \"well what if we just took all these proteins off of the surface so that they don't get recognized?\" Well, the problem is that we have another class of immune cells known as Natural Killer Cells that patrol the body looking for cells that are not presenting these proteins, so the immune system is pretty adept and finding and killing things that it does not recognize specifically as self.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was wondering, when a baby gets weaned (starts eating regular food), where do these fauna come from? Does the baby produce them, or are they provided in the food and survive the defense system?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To be honest, the majority of the microbiome is laid down during vaginal birth and breast feeding. Passing through the birth canal, microbes from the mother's vagina and feces are ingested by the newborn and this is their first real dose of microbiome, though some research is suggesting that the microbiome begins to form in the fetus before birth and is transferred through the placenta from the mother to the fetus. <\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming we do not kill these bacteria with antibiotics, have other pathogenic bacteria take over the territory (yes, bacteria and fungi, like gangs, have turf wars; that is why we often find our antibiotics as compounds secreted by these organisms), or have a disease that wipes out the microbiome, and provide it with a health diet, then the microbiome pretty much is maintained by the microbial cells reproducing by cell division.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also we will pick up these bacteria from the environment. We are constantly shedding enormous amounts of these cells into our environment. Babies touch things and put their hands in their mouths. This transfers good microbes as well as bad ones, and it is really just a natural part of the process. That is why the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterial soaps can cause unintended consequences. We are killing the good as well as the bad.<\/p>\n\n<p>This reference, <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiome/changing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Your Changing Microbiome<\/a>, again from The University of Utah is a good resource.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So to summarize, babies get the microbiome at birth through vaginal flora and maternal feces. They are also getting daily doses from the microbes that colonize the mother's skin when she nurses the child. Then these bacteria are also in the environment, so babies touch things, then they put their hands (or feet, the little contortionists) in their mouths and they get doses this way. Raw fruits and vegetables will also have microbes on them that will be taken in. As for the microbes, they have cell walls that allow them to live in environments that would be hostile if they did not have the cell walls. They also communicate with our immune system and \"train\" it not to kill them, and as long as nothing that we do, such as take antibiotics or get a disease, the microbiome will pretty much maintain itself through replication.<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":41429,"question_id":41415,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1450217578}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41415/do-intestinal-flora-have-the-same-dna-as-their-host","last_activity_date":1450217578,"creation_date":1449786914,"answer_count":2,"title":"Do intestinal flora have the same DNA as their host?","body":"<p>Please bear with me, this is not my professional field and I might be mixing things up.

So the microbiome lives on our body, and not in it or as a part of it. <\/p>\n\n<p>No place in our body do we have organs or tissue that is a homogenate of human cells and bacterial cells functioning together normally. And while there are bacteria that are able to infiltrate cells and live within vesicles or the cytoplasm, this is a pathogenic condition and not what we would normally expect to see in a healthy human. <\/p>\n\n<p>We know that this is the case, because developmentally all of our body cells and germ cells arise for the fertilized egg. It isn't until much later in development or at the moment of birth (there are some reports that microbiome begins to cross the placenta prior to birth) that we acquire our microbiome. If it were the case that humans, or any eukaryotic organism for that matter, were 90% bacteria, then we would not develop in the sterile environment of the amniotic sac.

In these imprint disorders, there is a genetic deletion in chromosome 15 in a majority of patients.

These stools lack a normal amorphous quality, because\n  bacteria are missing and there is nothing to retain water. The lumps\n  are hard and abrasive, the typical diameter ranges from 1 to 2 cm\n  (0.4\u20130.8\u201d), and they're painful to pass, because the lumps are hard\n  and scratchy. There is a high likelihood of anorectal bleeding from\n  mechanical laceration of the anal canal. Typical for post-antibiotic\n  treatments and for people attempting fiber-free (low-carb) diets.\n  Flatulence isn't likely, because fermentation of fiber isn't taking\n  place.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 2: Sausage-like but lumpy Represents a combination of Type 1\n  stools impacted into a single mass and lumped together by fiber\n  components and some bacteria. Typical for organic constipation. The\n  diameter is 3 to 4 cm (1.2\u20131.6\u201d). This type is the most destructive by\n  far because its size is near or exceeds the maximum opening of the\n  anal canal\u2018s aperture (3.5 cm). It\u2018s bound to cause extreme straining\n  during elimination, and most likely to cause anal canal laceration,\n  hemorrhoidal prolapse, or diverticulosis. To attain this form, the\n  stools must be in the colon for at least several weeks instead of the\n  normal 72 hours. Anorectal pain, hemorrhoidal disease, anal fissures,\n  withholding or delaying of defecation, and a history of chronic\n  constipation are the most likely causes. Minor flatulence is probable.\n  A person experiencing these stools is most likely to suffer from\n  irritable bowel syndrome because of continuous pressure of large\n  stools on the intestinal walls. The possibility of obstruction of the\n  small intestine is high, because the large intestine is filled to\n  capacity with stools. Adding supplemental fiber to expel these stools\n  is dangerous, because the expanded fiber has no place to go, and may\n  cause hernia, obstruction, or perforation of the small and large\n  intestine alike.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks in the surface This form has\n  all of the characteristics of Type 2 stools, but the transit time is\n  faster, between one and two weeks. Typical for latent constipation.\n  The diameter is 2 to 3.5 cm (0.8\u20131.4\u201d). Irritable bowel syndrome is\n  likely. Flatulence is minor, because of disbacteriosis. The fact that\n  it hasn't became as enlarged as Type 2 suggests that the defecations\n  are regular. Straining is required. All of the adverse effects typical\n  for Type 2 stools are likely for type 3, especially the rapid\n  deterioration of hemorrhoidal disease.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft This form is normal\n  for someone defecating once daily. The diameter is 1 to 2 cm\n  (0.4\u20130.8\u201d). The larger diameter suggests a longer transit time or a\n  large amount of dietary fiber in the diet.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges I consider this form ideal.\n  It is typical for a person who has stools twice or three times daily,\n  after major meals. The diameter is 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4\u20130.6\u201d).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool This form is\n  close to the margins of comfort in several respects. First, it may be\n  difficult to control the urge, especially when you don\u2018t have\n  immediate access to a bathroom. Second, it is a rather messy affair to\n  manage with toilet paper alone, unless you have access to a flexible\n  shower or bidet. Otherwise, I consider it borderline normal. These\n  kind of stools may suggest a slightly hyperactive colon (fast\n  motility), excess dietary potassium, or sudden dehydration or spike in\n  blood pressure related to stress (both cause the rapid release of\n  water and potassium from blood plasma into the intestinal cavity). It\n  can also indicate a hypersensitive personality prone to stress, too\n  many spices, drinking water with a high mineral content, or the use of\n  osmotic (mineral salts) laxatives.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>» Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces This, of course, is diarrhea, a\n  subject outside the scope of this chapter with just one important and\n  notable exception\u2014so-called paradoxical diarrhea. It\u2018s typical for\n  people (especially young children and infirm or convalescing adults)\n  affected by fecal impaction\u2014a condition that follows or accompanies\n  type 1 stools. During paradoxical diarrhea the liquid contents of the\n  small intestine (up to 1.5\u20132 liters/quarts daily) have no place to go\n  but down, because the large intestine is stuffed with impacted stools\n  throughout its entire length. Some water gets absorbed, the rest\n  accumulates in the rectum. The reason this type of diarrhea is called\n  paradoxical is not because its nature isn\u2018t known or understood, but\n  because being severely constipated and experiencing diarrhea all at\n  once, is, indeed, a paradoxical situation. Unfortunately, it\u2018s all too\n  common.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Interestingly, the interpretations and explanations of the BSF scale\n  that accompany the original chart differ from my analysis. To this I\n  can only say: thanks for great pictures, but, no thanks for the\n  rest...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Excerpted from Fiber Menace, page 117-120; BSF Chart: wikipedia.org<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But to make it more clear:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reasons behind thicker and harder stool:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lower fiber food<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lower liquid intake<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lower physical activity<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lack or lower amount of bacteria related to retaining water inside rectum and colon<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Medication:    <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many medications have constipation as a side effect.

But if we adopt that definition of 'leg' then there certainly are animals with odd numbers of legs: kangaroos, for instance, have a five-legged gait, functionally <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/07/amazing-five-legged-kangaroo\" rel=\"nofollow\">using their tail as a fifth leg<\/a>. There is no developmental process that stops an animal from growing an odd number of <em>appendages<\/em>, and if one of those appendages happens to be used as a leg, evolution and development will have no problem with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is another way to define 'leg', and that is by homology - 'legs' are the appendages derived by evolution from the legs of a common ancestor. Under this definition, (for vertebrates, at least) you're a bit more hard-pressed to find examples of animals with an odd number. This is because those legs are paired appendages, and the developmental pathways for the leg on one side of the body are tied into the developmental pathways for the leg on the other side of the body, so it is <em>hard<\/em> to evolve an odd number of legs from these appendages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hard is not the same as impossible, though. A comparable piece of evolution is the severe reduction in size of fins from one side of the body in flatfishes (flounders, sole, etc).

But the factor for green seed persists, even if the plant is yellow, and can reappear unchanged in later generations. <strong>This was a signal advance.<\/strong> In the 19th century it was believed that the traits of parents were blended in their offspring and, once mixed, the contributing traits could not be recovered.

The mouse work by Xiaoping Ren (see <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.12341/pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this 2014 paper<\/a>) seems to have a very steep death-curve post-surgery:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Forty Kunming mice and forty C57 wild type underwent the\n  AHBR  procedure.  After  transplantation,  18  mice  survived\n  for 3 h after the ventilator was disconnected.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are no details in the paper about how long the most robust mouse survived for post-surgery. I would guess that it is not an impressive number, otherwise the authors would include it. Alternatively, the 18 surviving mice may have been euthanased after three hours - the paper does not make this clear, but it is common to have a predetermined time-limit for euthanasia in experiments where animals are expected to suffer from an irreversible treatment.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During these 3 h, the mice\n  awakened and displayed normal cranial nerve function and\n  characteristic responsiveness (blinking, whiskers moving, etc.).\n  After the mice awoke, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings\n  were  made  directly  from  the  cortex  of  the  transplanted\n  Cephalons (Figure 3). Because blood supply was maintained at\n  an adequate level during surgery by anastomosing the donor\n  and recipient carotid and jugular vessels, the intra- and post-\n  operative EEG and ECG show electrophysiological activity.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds a lot like a 'no' to 'can this technique be used to substantially extend human lifespans?', on current technology. If a human trial is approved, and is as successful as the mouse trials, the recipient will likely be dead within hours. If they survive for several hours, the level of motor control that can be expected in that time is likely restricted to unconscious motor tics (cf whisker twitching and blinking).<\/p>\n","answer_id":41515,"question_id":40992,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40992/head-transplant-feasibility-project-heaven-gemini","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/skeptics/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"scientific skepticism","aliases":["http://skeptic.stackexchange.com","http://skepticexchange.com"],"favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/skeptics/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/skeptics/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"skeptics","open_beta_date":1299196800,"site_state":"normal","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.skeptics.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.skeptics","name":"Skeptics Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=skeptics.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1298505600,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://skeptics.stackexchange.com","name":"Skeptics","high_resolution_icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/skeptics/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png","twitter_account":"StackSkeptic","launch_date":1332288000},"on_date":1448456535,"question_id":30919},"last_activity_date":1450083076,"creation_date":1448448382,"answer_count":1,"title":"Head transplant feasibility - Project HEAVEN-GEMINI","body":"<p>There is a <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301073.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">news circulating<\/a> that in the next two years, Dr. Sergio Canavero, of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group (TANG) in Italy, will perform the world's first head transplantation.

I have never actually heard of a case of hyponatremia being caused by low consumption of salt. We don't need to consume NaCl. It's present in the foods we eat in adequate amounts. We may <em>want<\/em> to salt our food, but it's not necessary for life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hyponatremia is an electrolyte imbalance, be it due to excess intake of H<sub>2<\/sub>O, inappropriate H<sub>2<\/sub>O retention, excess Na+ loss, hyperglygemia or other osmotic force, or other cause. For ease of explanation, I'll address acute hyponatremia, as it leads to death more rapidly. Hyponatremia kills because of the difference in the concentration of sodium across cell membranes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Normal serum Sodium (Na+) is ~140mEq/L. Acute <em>severe<\/em> hyponatremia occurs when serum Na+ falls rapidly below 120 mEq/l (some authors use 125mEq/L) in less than 48 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Water accounts for 60% of total body weight, with approximately two-thirds being intracellular and one-third extracellular; of that extracellular water, ~75% is in the fluid between/surrounding cells, and 25% is in blood vessels. Distribution of water/Na+ throughout the body is very tightly regulated. <\/p>\n\n<p>When serum sodium falls too low, free water moves from areas of lower concentration to higher (into the cells). Tissue becomes <em>edematous<\/em>.  While this isn't a great problem for some tissues, it is for the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>The brain is enclosed in a rigid compartment (the skull) with a small amount of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) surrounding it. Inferiorly, there is an small opening called the foramen magmun, where the brainstem leads to the spinal cord.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dGNetm.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dGNetm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>When water moves from the blood into the cells of the brain attempting to establish osmotic equilibrium, the brain compensates for the increase in volume by forcing CSF out. This buys some time, but not enough; there is headache and nausea. As the brain continues to expand, intercellular fluid is forced out into CSF (which is being displaced by the brain.) This causes hyperexcitability which leads to seizures. In the meantime, astrocytes swell. Blood flow to the brain is reduced because of increased intracranial pressure, which further damages the cells, increases cellular edema and coma ensues.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If this isn't bad enough (it is; it's an almost irreparable  cascade of events), the edema can actually \"push\" the lower part of the brain down through the foramen magnum resulting in brain stem compression and respiratory arrest. At this point, few people make it back intact with even the best help. <\/p>\n\n<p>You say,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Basically with too little sodium, it goes from bad to worse until the heart and lungs are affected and the person dies.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Not really.

But on a normal day, you don't sweat all that much. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when you metabolize food, you essentially burn it. According to the <a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/overview-of-nutrition/carbohydrates,-proteins,-and-fats\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merck Manual<\/a>, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats supply 90% of the dry weight of the diet and 100% of its energy. All three provide energy (measured in calories), but the amount of energy in 1 gram (1/28 ounce) differs:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>4 calories in a gram of carbohydrate or protein\n\n9 calories in a gram of fat\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A typical diet is 2000 calories per day. If you get 50% of your calories from fat (shame on you!), that is 1000 calories of carbohydrate or protein, or 250 grams. It is 1000 calories of fat, or 111 grams. 361 grams total.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will simplify. CH bonds contain little energy compared to CC bonds. H weighs little compared to C. We don't change much by ignoring H. There is some O and other stuff, but we will ignore that too. It will still be roughly right. So you burn about 361 grams of C. <\/p>\n\n<p>For every C atoms you metabolize, you must breathe in 2 O atoms, and breathe out all 3 atoms as CO2. C atoms have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_atomic_mass\" rel=\"nofollow\">atomic weight<\/a> of 12. O is 16. So CO2 is 44. Every 12 grams of C becomes 44 grams of CO2. So to burn 261 g of C, you breathe out 1324 g of CO2. <\/p>\n\n<p>1324 g of water would be 1.324 liters. It is easily possible to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration\" rel=\"nofollow\">sweat that much<\/a> in a day, but you typically don't.

Are you starting from a dead stop, or passing the starting marker at speed? Do you have to start the car first, or is it already running? How many turns and other slowdowns are on the road? Do you stop measuring as the car passes the finish marker, or when it comes to a complete stop?

While it is everything but that, it must be able to obtain fluids and nutrients through its mother's milk, and that from pretty much the first hour of its life.<\/p>\n\n<p>To develop proper kidney function, the growing fetus needs to ingest fluids just as it will do <em>post partum<\/em>. Because a mini bar isn't available, it has to drink whatever is available, i.e., amniotic fluid and indeed, its own urine. Shortly after the kidneys start to produce urine, the fetal swallowing commences. <\/p>\n\n<p>Amniotic fluid is 98% water and 2% salts and cells from the baby. Until the fetal kidneys start working during month four, amniotic fluid is made by the mother\u2019s body. But after month 4, the fetus starts to make his contribution to the amniotic fluid by urinating into it (<a href=\"http://www.pennmedicine.org/encyclopedia/em_DisplayAnimation.aspx?gcid=000130&amp;ptid=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penn Medicine<\/a>). Production of amniotic fluid is then predominately accomplished by excretion of fetal urine (300 ml/kg fetal weight/day or 600 to 1200 ml/day near term) and the secretion of oral, nasal, tracheal, and pulmonary fluids (60 to 100 ml/kg fetal weight/day). Fetal breathing movements also contribute by efflux of lung fluid into the amniotic fluid. Removal of AF is predominately accomplished by fetal swallowing (200 to 250 ml/kg fetal weight/day) <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v25/n5/full/7211290a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Underwood <em>et al<\/em>., 2005)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The water in amniotic fluid originally comes from maternal plasma and passes through the fetal membranes. As the placenta develops, water and solutes from maternal plasma pass across the placenta to the fetus and then to the amniotic fluid <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v25/n5/full/7211290a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Underwood <em>et al<\/em>., 2005)<\/a>, see Fig. 1. <\/p>\n\n<p>Swallowing its own urine is not only not dangerous, it is <em>essential<\/em> to proper development. A decrease in fetal urine production or excretion can result in a reduced amount of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios). Oligohydramnios can result in fetal lung deformations (pulmonary hypoplasia) and increased risk of infection.  Fetal mortality rates as high as 80-90% have been reported with oligohydramnios diagnosed in the second trimester (Source: <a href=\"http://patient.info/doctor/Oligohydramnios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patient Info<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>If the fetus would have to prevent the production of urine <em>in utero<\/em>, the kidneys would have to remain nonfunctional during development, which would be disastrous once it is born.

When they lost their body hair (or at least most of it), they needed some other protection of their skin from the sun - otherwise they are prone to develop melanoma. Melanin is such a protection, and the rate of melanoma is much lower in dark skinned people. \nThere is also a nice correlation between latitude and skin color - the more to the north (and to some degree to the south as well) you get, the lighter the skin color of the population gets.

One very good example is the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R), which is mutated pretty often in europeans (mutations in this gene are generally associated with lighter skin and hair color; people with red hair carry certain mutations in this gene) but its under selection pressure to not mutate in africa (there are almost no known mutations in MC1R for africans).

This enables colors from white (not pigmentation) to black (dense eumelanin pigmentation) and also colors in between by different ratios of the two pigments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The evolutionary answer is that it obviously made no evolutionary advantage to have other colors. If you look closer at this, you will see that most habitats are not green or only for a part of the year. If you think about african plains, these are mostly brown, something like artic landscapes are only green for a very short timeframe in the summer, for the rest of the year these are white to brown. And even tropical rainforests are mostly dark to brown on the ground.

Not all animal colouration is produced by melanin. A whole range of bright colours in insects, birds and reptiles comes under the heading of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration\">structural colouration<\/a>, which basically involves having a repeating structure at the microscopic level to interact with light. This is the basis for macaw colours, peacock feathers, and some butterfly wing colours.<\/p>\n\n<p>It also occurs in mammals - see for example the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrill\">mandrill<\/a>. In this case the coloured patches are bare skin containing ordered collagen fibres to create the effect, (<a href=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/12/2157.full\">science here<\/a>). I have no idea if collagen could be structured to produce a green colour. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, an anecdote: a number of years ago a polar bear in the San Diego zoo was seen to develop green patches. Upon investigation this was found to be due to damaged hair shafts in areas where the animal rubbed against surfaces in its enclosure. In the polar bear the hair shafts are hollow, for insulation, and the damaged hairs were being colonised by algae.

Wounds and minor damage to the skin or flesh for example heal by themselves, skin, nails and body hair can grow back if damaged or removed, even most bones can be repaired autonomously by a biological body. Cutting off a significant chunk from the human flesh or removing over 90% of a hair or a nail would cause no permanent injury, and the body is capable of repairing the damage over time with ease. The vast majority of the human body (not counting critical organs such as the heart or the brain) can be \"grown back\" to an extent by itself, because such parts have a rather large damage threshold.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, teeth do not. There is a certain threshold in which tooth enamel can be supplied and \"repaired\" by the body to an minimal degree, but past that point virtually any damage caused to teeth are permanently irreparable by natural means. Which is quite strange, given how fragile a set of human teeth is, be it chemical or physical damage. Especially if you take more \"artificial\" causes into account. A moderately heavy object aimed towards a human mouth, for example, can easily render ten to fifteen teeth permanently damaged past the point of recovery within a heartbeat, also causing the said person's digestive process to be heavily impaired.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another strange fact worth noting, is that the human body is capable of producing two separate set of teeth due to biological growth and size differences, but not more than that. Wouldn't it be beneficial for a biological body to be able to supply new teeth in the place of ones that have been damaged or removed? One could argue that such an action would be too complex and impossible, similarly to growing back an entire limb or a spare heart, but given the material that makes up teeth and its fragile nature, it would be safe to assume that it is biologically possible, especially given the fact that the human body DOES produce two separate set of teeth over its lifespan.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, even stranger still, is that the only element capable of damaging or deteriorating  teeth by natural means, is the consumed <em>food<\/em> itself, and the acidic bacteria found within. Several types of edible food consumable by human means are capable of damaging the enamel to critical levels within relatively short periods of time, even non-artificial ones. What happened before the invention of the toothbrush and various dental cleaning methods? Why haven't humans evolved in the past tens of thousands of years to the point where repairing or regrowing teeth by natural means is feasible?

That is, it's the difference between the energy of the apo-enzyme and substrate in the non-bound form (\"$E+S$\") and the enzyme and substrate in the bound form (\"$ES$\").<\/p>\n\n<p>The other binding energy is $\\Delta G^T_{bind}$. This is the (theoretical) binding energy of the transition state. That is, it's the energy difference between the enzyme-transition state complex (here labeled \"$T_{uncat}$\", for some reason; it probably should be \"$ET_{cat}$\") and the apo-enzyme and the unbound transition state (\"$E+T_{uncat}$\"). <\/p>\n\n<p>Now remember that free energy is a state function. A free energy change ($\\Delta G$) is simply the difference between the free energies of the starting state and the ending state - it doesn't depend on the path you take to get there. (The absolute free energies of any given state are unmeasurable, but you can infer information about relative free energies by measuring the $\\Delta G$ of transitions between them.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The two equations at the bottom are derivable from this definition of free energies as a state function. You know that the free energy difference between the $ES$ and the $E+T_{uncat}$ state is the same regardless of the path you take. So if you go first through $ES$ the free energy change ( $- \\Delta G_{bind}^R  + \\Delta G_{uncat}^\\ddagger$) will be equal to that if you go through \"$T_{uncat}$\" ($\\Delta G_{cat}^\\ddagger - \\Delta G_{bind}^T$) - you don't necessarily need to have physically realizable reactions for the state function property to hold. The second equation is then simply a rearrangement of the first.<\/p>\n\n<p>In looking at the rate of catalysis, you're primarily interested in how big a free energy change it is to the relevant transition state from the previous state. (This is a basic principle of Transition State Theory.) To speed things up, the enzyme needs to make that energy change smaller - that is, to make $\\Delta G_{cat}^\\ddagger$ smaller than $\\Delta G_{uncat}^\\ddagger$. If the enzyme binds the substrate and the transition state equally well, $\\Delta G_{bind}^R$ and $\\Delta G_{bind}^T$ are the same, and $ES$ and \"$T_{uncat}$\" are lowered by the same amount, such that $\\Delta G_{cat}^\\ddagger$ and $\\Delta G_{uncat}^\\ddagger$ are equal: no catalysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if instead $\\Delta G_{bind}^T$ is <em>greater<\/em> than $\\Delta G_{bind}^R$, then the \"$T_{uncat}$\" state is lowered more than the $ES$ state, making the gap between them ($\\Delta G_{cat}^\\ddagger$) smaller than the gap between $E+S$ and $E+T_{uncat}$ ($\\Delta G_{uncat}^\\ddagger$): the enzyme thus speeds up the reaction. This is what that second equation is saying.<\/p>\n\n<p>This sort of thermodynamic analysis is what leads to the \"transition state stabilization\" hypothesis of how enzymes work: enzymes speed up reactions because they bind to the transition state more tightly than the substrates or the products. <\/p>\n\n<p>(P.S. You may be wondering why we have the enzyme hanging around in the uncatalyzed reactions. This is simply a bookkeeping measure to make sure we're using the same reference state for the very start of the reaction ($E+S$). In the uncatalyzed reaction the enzyme doesn't change, and so doesn't really contribute to any free energy change.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":41437,"question_id":41395,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41395/why-is-binding-energy-the-difference-between-%e2%88%86g-catalyzed-and-%e2%88%86g-uncatalyzed","last_activity_date":1449877818,"creation_date":1449717362,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is binding energy the difference between ∆G catalyzed and ∆G uncatalyzed?","body":"<p>I think the title explains it pretty well -- I'm confused on what 1) exactly binding energy is 2) and why it's the difference.

The association with MHC proteins depends on the specific sequence of amino acids, and you can think of this association as depending on a number of amino acids (let's say 4 or 5) that point \"down\" into the MHC.  That leaves maybe 4-10 amino acids pointing \"up\" that can interact with the T cell receptor.  If you search for a random set of 4 amino acids with a given spacing, it's quite likely that it will turn up several times in a large protein database; even more often if you allow some degeneracy (similar amino acids can substitute sometimes).  Therefore, yes, T cells tend to have a moderate amount of degeneracy in their epitope recognition.  However, while search a whole database may find duplicates, the degeneracy is not terrible, and the MHC binding requirement also reduces it quite a bit. Also, of course, during T cell development, TcRs that have broad and degenerate recognition of many structures are selected against.  So T cells are definitely cross-reactive, and sometimes extensively so, but in single individuals it's probably not a common thing.  (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=welsh+selin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ray Welsh and Liisa Selin<\/a> have looked at cross-recognition between viruses and find quite a bit of cross-reactivity, though, so this may be understated.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Antibodies, unlike T cells, recognize conformational epitopes rather than linear sequences.  However, just as with linear epitopes, it's not impossible for two unrelated proteins to end up with similar conformations, even with rather different amino acids.  As well, antibodies can be more or less \"forgiving\" in their recognition; some are extremely specific, but others can interact with a wider range of shapes.  You can imagine a \"flat\" antibody binding surface that is rather generic, that could interact with many different shapes. Again, B cells with broad cross-recognition are selected against during development, though not as rigorously as are T cells.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":41376,"question_id":39024,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39024/specificity-of-the-adaptive-lymphocytes","last_activity_date":1449834085,"creation_date":1443073884,"answer_count":2,"title":"Specificity of the adaptive lymphocytes","body":"<p>T cells are known for their ability to bind multiple antigens, owing to the degeneracy of the recognition sites on their receptors.

Bats can emit two kinds of ultrasonic signals. One is a short pulse (less than 5 ms long) that sweeps a wide range of frequencies (100 Hz to 25 kHz) and is referred to as a FM sweep, or a broadband signal. The second kind in a constant frequency (CF) and is much longer in duration (5-30 ms) and held at a specific frequency. In addition to the fundamental frequency there are first and second harmonics. This important for depth perception, pursuit of prey, and location of other bats!<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, bats measure distance by comparing the time between emitted sound pulses and its returning echo. Rapid FM sweeps are especially well suited for target distance so the bat can adjust easily and locate the target. Bats can determine angle, size, elevation, azimuth, and velocity/movement of object from these time and frequency differences as well. Now, bats calculate their own velocity using the Doppler shift concept of their own echos. Meaning, when their signals comes back to them, they compare the amplitude of what their ultrasonic sound wave would be if they weren't moving to the received sound and calculate actual velocity off that (it is a very complicated process and I'm trying to simplify it to get to your question).<\/p>\n\n<p>Ok, now that is the basics of echo location, but back to your question: What happens when there are multiple bats? Well, when you have many ultrasonic waves going at once, it might get confusing about which is your signal. At least that what you would think. Since the bats have such a wide range of frequencies they can vocally create (100 Hz to 25 k Hz), bats usually simply change the range they are vocalizing to prevent wave disruption. If you do get an overlap of waves from bats using the same frequency, you get something similar to Doppler effect where amplitudes are not what expected. Since they are pretty drastic changes (sometimes even canceling out the wave entirely), and a bat can sense if another bat is around them by calculating the size of the objects producing noise, a bat will know this distortion is due to another bat and not the prey. As a result one bat will have to change their frequency range. This has become sort of a dominance game for them as a result. The bats heightens (I think, might be lower) the frequency of their signals until one cannot go any farther. The one with the wider range is considered dominant and rules that frequency range.

The hydroxyl radical can interact with proteins and DNA and damage those molecules, but has a very short half-life. Molecular oxygen can help increase the damage by reacting with the hydroxyl radical to produce Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS, which can also damage DNA or protein. However, many tumors have low oxygen concentration that reduces the effectiveness of photon based radiation therapy.<\/p>\n\n<p>To overcome this, many patients receive proton based radiation therapy. Protons are much heavier than photons (I guess infinitely heavier than a photon, since photons have no mass) and therefore scatter to a much smaller extent.

They don't rely so much on free radical generation or ROS, so low oxygen levels don't reduce their effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal is damage the DNA to induce double strand breaks which are hard to repair in fast growing cancer cells.

Each cycle the uterus builds a glandular epithelium with a high secretory capacity and an elaborate microvasculature, only to reabsorb or void it with the menses if implantation does not oc-cur. Why does the endometrium not maintain a steady state of readiness for implantation by the blastocyst? What is the selective advantage of cyclical regeneration and regression?<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>One hypothesis<\/strong><sup>2<\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n<p>In  1993, Margie Profet hypothesized that menstruation is primarily advantageous as a defense against pathogens transported by sperm. During mammalian insemination, she stated, bacteria from the male and female genitalia cling to sperm tails and are transported to the uterus. Menstruation, triggered by the abrupt constriction (causing necrosis of endometrial lining) followed by dilation (causing shedding of said necrotic tissue), forces loose not only the endometrial lining but sperm-borne pathogens contained therein. In addition to shedding the uterine tissue harboring these bacteria, menstruation delivers immune cells to the uterine cavity, triggered by the mechanical pressure exerted via the shedding of endometrial lining.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In this 50 page (!) article, Profet also points out that other mammals with covert menstruation take advantage of some of these same benefits, as the immunological stimulation includes phagocytosis of pathogens by cells that may be expelled in cervical/vaginal mucous. Further, proestrous  bleeding (i.e. that preceding ovulation, 180 degrees off from the human cycle), which occurs in some mammals (domestic dog, coyote, etc), seems to serve a similar function.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If not eliminated prior to estrus, these tenacious pathogens might otherwise attach to incoming sperm during estrus and ascend the oviducts. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As to why humans and other primates are subject to overt bleeding in contrast to other mammals, she lays out a theoretical argument that selection pressure to menstruate should increase with decreasing per-cycle \u201cfecundability\u201d (the probability of pregnancy) because copulation not followed by bleeding risks infection. In contrast to, e.g., mice (98% fecundability), humans have some of the lowest fecundability rates, primarily due to \u201cconcealed\u201d ovulation which de-couples copulation and ovulation. (Contrast this to most mammals whose females have a defined estrous period during which they are receptive to male sexual advances; the data for the existence of such a period in humans are controversial, and sexual behavior is driven primarily by \u201chigher\u201d social, environmental, and cognitive cues.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A different view<\/strong><sup>1<\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n<p>In response/objection to this paper, Beverly Strassman in the same journal published an article outlining an alternative hypothesis about the potential adaptive value of menstruation. She proposed a hypothesis based on energy conservation: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he uterine endometrium is shed/resorbed whenever implantation fails because cyclical regression and renewal is energetically less costly than maintaining the endometrium in the metabolically active state required for implantation. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Her research determined that, in its regressed state (i.e. s/p endometrial shedding), oxygen consumption in the endometrial tissue is markedly declined, nearly sevenfold. Although this would seem to be a trivial component of whole-body metabolism, she argues otherwise:  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Metabolic rate is at least 7% lower, on average, during the follicular phase than during the luteal phase in women, which signifies an estimated energy savings of 53 MJ over four cycles, or nearly six days worth of food. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Her argument shares with Profer\u2019s the implication that mammals with lower fecundability are more likely to menstruate. In those with high probability of pregnancy at every cycle, the energetic benefits of ridding the body of the need to support endometrial lining (relevant only in the absence of pregnancy), are decreased. Her hypothesis also predicts the larger volume of menstrual shedding in humans and chimps in contrast to other mammals related to the increased uterine size relative to the female body (a ratio that is largely determined by the especially large head of the human fetus).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>As noted in the comments, only primates have overt menstrual bleeding. The adaptive benefits have been variously explained, and it is probable that there is more than one operative explanatory model. Whatever the small decrement in survivalship incurred by the intermittent and uncontrolled depositing of blood in the wild, it is apparently outweighed in these species by the processes described above.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>\n<strong>References and Notes<\/strong>\n<\/sup>\n<sup><br>\n<strong>1<\/strong>.
