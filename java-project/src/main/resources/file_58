The opponent system (Red/Green; Blue/Yellow and brightness channels) is physiologically situated in the neuronal retinal layer and higher visual structures such as the lateral geniculate nucleus and receives input from the RGB system (photoreceptors in the retina: Red, Green, Blue cones). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sGqRR.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Then the question becomes \"<strong><em>what is the advantage of adding the opponent channels on top of the RGB system?<\/em><\/strong> The advantage of opponency may in fact not be the negative opponent effect so often stressed in the Hering model (and shown in the figure: e.g., blue suppressing yellow etc). The advantage lies in the finding that activity of one opponent pair <em>increases activity<\/em> of the opponent color in adjacent areas in the retina. This effect results in a <strong>sharpening of color contrasts<\/strong> between the opponent colors (<a href=\"http://jraissati.com/PHIL256/09_HurvichJameson_AnOpponentTheoryOfColorVision.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hurvich and Jameson, 1957<\/a>). Indeed, the poor spatial color-contrast, as provided by the sparsely placed cones in the retina, is enhanced by this mechanism. Especially the blue cones are present in isolated patches in the retina. Because one color in an opponent pair increases the other's activity directly adjacent to it in the retina, the resolution of the blurry retinal image is greatly increased. Hence, as you rightfully say, <em>edge detection<\/em> and in particular <strong>color contrast perception<\/strong> is enhanced. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Object recognition<\/em>, as you mention in your question, is a process that is facilitated by the visual system through many stages including the higher visual cortices. Enhanced color contrast will likely facilitate object perception, but indirectly since color contrasting makes up just a small portion of a much bigger and complicated neural system devoted to object recognition, namely the visual 'ventral' stream (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/96/16/9379.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ishai et al., 1999<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly you ask whether opponent colors may facilitate <em>invariance to brightness<\/em>. Assuming you mean color invariance under varying luminance (referred to as <strong>color constancy<\/strong>) the answer is <strong>no<\/strong>. The RGB cone system can deal with this easily, as the <strong>ratio of cone activation<\/strong> yields enough information to code the hue under various luminances. If a certain object reflection activates twice as many red cones than green cones, it will also activate the same ratio when the luminance is increased (<a href=\"http://www.psypress.com/cw/mather-9781841696997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mather, 2006 - Chapter 12<\/a>).      <\/p>\n","answer_id":27486,"question_id":26216,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1426683818}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26216/advantage-of-opponent-color","last_activity_date":1426683818,"creation_date":1419661329,"answer_count":2,"title":"Advantage of opponent color?","body":"<p>Opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cones and rods in an antagonistic manner (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>What is the advantage of opponent color against RGB color?

In the patient the growth of a cacncer is only\n  detectable and observable during the last 10-14 of its 35-40 doubling\n  times.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.hu/books?id=RI7eS2Z8DHMC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=cancer+division+time+hours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pl6wRJXhvq&amp;sig=Lt7-cupUnyOS0XzP0Lg8Z6x6Cm4&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ni4JVZyTEcz9UqTngsAD&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cancer%20division%20time%20hours&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancer Nursing: Care in Context (page 270)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So according to this book the division rate of cancer cells are similar to healthy cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to another book this statement is from Dougherty &amp; Bailey 2001, but I wasn't able to find the scientific article. :S<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tumour cells appear to have lost control mechanisms which prevent cells from growing until replacement is required.

Unfortunately, as @adam.r said, you are laboring under certain misapprehensions. The quick answer is that each generation does not \"improve\" on the last. That is a common misconception. In a bit more detail:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>First of all, your copying metaphor is a bad one. There was no \"perfect original\", I expand on this theme at length in my answer <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/9596/1306\">here<\/a> but, briefly, all species are constantly changing. They are not moving away from a platonic ideal of the perfect species (or towards it for that matter), they are simply changing in response to the world around them. What's 'good' today is not necessarily 'good' tomorrow.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Your copy machine metaphor does hold for changes from one generation to the next though. Copying DNA is <em>fraught<\/em> with errors. There is a huge cellular machinery in place whose only job is to catch and correct those errors. Nevertheless, many get through and result in diversity that can then be selected for or against through the process of natural selection. So, the copies <em>do<\/em> actually degrade. That, in fact, is the very basis of how evolution works.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Another important point is that most changes are neutral. They have absolutely no effect one way or the other. There are many reasons for this but the main ones are<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The vast majority of DNA does not actually code for protein. What it <em>does<\/em> do is an area of active research but minor changes in sequences that don't code for protein are extremely unlikely to cause a change in phenotype. <\/p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the information necessary to produce a viable organism is in the <strong>genes<\/strong>, and genes represent a very small (~5% in human for example) percentage of the genome. Changes that affect the fitness of an individual are almost invariably found in the coding sequences of genes. This means that of the ~30 billion possible sites for mutation in any given cell, 95% of them (even less actually since only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon\">exons<\/a> count and they're ~2%) will not cause a phenotypic effect. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The genetic code is redundant. Basically, DNA is \"read\" in \"words\" of three \"letters\", the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon\">codons<\/a>. Since there are 4 bases in the genome (A,C,T and G) this means there are 64 possible codons. Each codon specifies a particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid\">amino acid<\/a> (the building blocks of proteins) and a given sequence of codons will result in a specific sequence of amino acids. However, there are only 22 amino acids, many of which are specified by the same codon:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yHBxX.gif\" alt=\"the genetic code\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the image above, in most cases, changing the third letter of the codon does not affect the amino acid that will be specified. This means that even for those mutations (changes) that occur in the coding region of genes, the chances are relatively high that they won't actually result in any phenotypic change. If you change the genetic code but the changed codon still codes for the same amino acid there will be no change in phenotype.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for your contributing factors:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Perfect Building Blocks<\/em>: Nope, sorry this one is wrong. First of all there is no such thing as a minor change that involves changing an atom. Any change that happens at the atomic level is <em>huge<\/em> by definition. That kind of thing happens a the hearts of stars and in nuclear reactors. The chemical reactions in our body involve changing <em>molecules<\/em> not atoms.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no such thing as a minor change really, if you replace one atom in a molecule by another, you are significantly changing the properties of that molecule (this is less true for large, complex macromolecules where some changes can indeed be minor). If you were to change, for example, a single atom in normal table salt ($NaCl$) from sodium to hydrogen, you would get $HCl$, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid\">hydrochloric acid<\/a> and not something you want to put in your soup.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are no perfect building blocks, in biology <em>nothing<\/em> is perfect, that only happens in math. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, the organism does <em>not<\/em> follow the same pattern from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular (never mind atomic) level. In fact, there are very different organizational principles at play at the different levels and the way that cells are organized (see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/11053/1306\">here<\/a> for example) has nothing to do with the way that a cell's contents are organized. <\/p>\n\n<p>Stability is overrated. In fact, our bodies contain loads of unstable (reactive) chemicals, oxygen being chief among them. By definition, chemical reactions involve changing molecules (not atoms, but we don't deal with that level, biological effects tend to be at the molecular, not atomic level). All reactions that go on in the factory that is your body involve the changing of one molecule into another. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>Fitness Correction:<\/em> Actually, at the cellular level, the corrections try to faithfully reproduce the template they are copying from. When a cell copies itself, it will also copy its DNA. It does so by using its own DNA as a template. There is no \"theoretical ideal\", the cell has no information about the genome of its parent, only its own. As I mentioned above, there are various corrective mechanisms whose job it is to spot errors and correct them. They have no way of knowing whether a given change will be beneficial or harmful to the individual, as far as these processes are concerned, any change is bad and should be corrected. The only thing they do is try to make a daughter cell's genome identical to the parent cell's.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a change makes it past the cellular level, <em>then<\/em> it can be selected for or against based on whether it makes the individual carrying it more or less likely to reproduce. This, however, is not a directed process. It just happens. If a mutation makes a male blue whale stronger, it is more likely to be the one that catches up with the racing female and so more likely to reproduce. There is no direction other than the selective process itself. There is no one around comparing new individuals to an ideal and selecting accordingly. If you're better at reproducing than your peers, your genes will be selected. <\/p>\n\n<p>Actually, many many gametes are discarded. Many cells die. You just don't know about it because they die before you can see them. So deleterious (very bad) changes <em>do<\/em> occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"I would expect 99.9% of the genome to be experimental, almost completely unusable liability to the species.\" In a way this is true. Despite <a href=\"https://genome.ucsc.edu/encode/\">recent findings<\/a>, 98% of the human genome does not directly affect the phenotype. It is only the 2% that represents the protein coding parts of genes that has a direct effect on fitness. In fact, in the human genome specifically, there is a short sequence that does not code for any protein and does not (directly, though there are various theories about this) affect our phenotype, that has been making copies of itself and propagating in our genome for generations. Today, this sequence (Alu) represents ~10% of the human genome, that's twice as much as all our genes together!<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>Mutation Management Mechanisms:<\/em> The basic protection mechanism you mention in your question is quite simply death. Mutations that render housekeeping genes (like the HOX cluster) inactive kill the organism that carries them. That does not mean they don't occur, it simply means that when they occur, we don't see them because the individual carrying the mutation is dead (see point 3). <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":13683,"question_id":13680,"up_vote_count":27,"last_edit_date":1426598466},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"score":9,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":3,"post_id":13763,"edited":false,"creation_date":1386022486,"comment_id":17985,"body":"+1 for a good answer, +2 for mentioning Wallace."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1386019170,"creation_date":1386019170,"body":"<p>I\u2019ll add a slightly different perspective, although terdon\u2019s answer already contains the relevant facts.<\/p>\n\n<p>The thing that makes DNA endure in the face of imperfect copying is that, like computer storage, it\u2019s <em>digital<\/em>.

I can't imagine that this model would actually work the way it does - so well in fact that the design actually improves over time. What am I missing or underestimating?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributing Factors (I guess):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Perfect Building Blocks:<\/em> Cellular development follows a pattern at every level, and ultimately operates all the way down to the molecular level. At that level, nearly all building blocks are identical. Life is built of stable atoms, not something like plutonium, and in the rare event that an atom does change, the result is simply a different kind of atom, which still tends toward a stable form in the long term. Because the structures of life are ultimately made of stable components that are plentiful everywhere in the environment, the essential structures being copied are precise and can be copied precisely. Photocopies and casts are not precise to the molecular level, so copying them is more approximate by nature. Digital data propagation, however, is a very similar process. Bits are also theoretically perfect building blocks.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Fitness Correction:<\/em> When mistakes do degrade the reproduction process, rather than maintaining or randomly improving upon it, there is a correction mechanism that removes the defects from the process. Those defects do not survive to reproduce. This evolutionary process acts to keep the reproductive pattern focused back upon a theoretical ideal which is independent of a specific physical form to be copied. <code>This seems like the most essential element of the explanation, because it is ultimately only through progression that digression can be avoided, but it is also the part that seems the most dubious. Astronomical quantities of defects would have to be produced before developing just one advantageous feature. I would expect living creatures to be 99% defective with only 1% surviving to breed. I would expect 99.9% of zygotes to expire without being born or sprouting from seed. I would expect all sexual organs (ovaries, testes, stamen, etc.), if not the majority of the whole body, to be mostly dead cells, with just a few successes surviving to fertilization. I would expect 99.9% of the genome to be experimental, almost completely unusable liability to the species. Essentially, I would expect premature death to far outweigh successful life everywhere and at all times. And even so, I would still expect evolution to be even slower than it has been.<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Mutation Management Mechanisms:<\/em> I understand that there are mechanisms in reproduction that decrease the likelihood of mutation in more established and stable parts of the genome compared with sections that are more open for discussion - epigenetic structures, HOX genes, etc. Portions of all genomes have been established and functional for hundreds of millions of years, so I gather that there are mechanisms for protecting them (I suspect probably far more than we have yet discovered).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> The numbers I present are fuzzy and are based not on calculations but on general impressions I get of the magnitude of the numbers involved and the relative rareness of useful mutations. Is there any place where this kind of calculation has been performed with more realistic approximations of probabilities?<\/p>\n","question_id":13680,"tags":["evolution","reproduction","replication","molecular-evolution"],"score":13,"accepted_answer_id":13683,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":425,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1385517387},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eghgy.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5669,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5669/dexterdev","reputation":560,"display_name":"dexterdev","accept_rate":73},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":30418,"edited":false,"creation_date":1426313270,"comment_id":50298,"body":"possible duplicate of <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14299/on-which-strand-does-the-promoter-sit\">On which strand does the promoter sit?<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":30418,"edited":false,"creation_date":1426362132,"comment_id":50315,"body":"I don&#39;t think this is a duplicate, in fact I might vote to close the other question and link to this one, as the accepted answer is much clearer and nicely illustrated, with links to sources.

Some proteins instead recognise a site on the helix by its <strong>shape and flexibility<\/strong>. ssDNA-binding proteins obviously bind one strand but they do this in a <strong>non-specific<\/strong> manner.\nRNA-binding proteins recognise the sequence on a single strand by inserting intercalating planar residues between bases! All of this binding is <strong>non-covalent<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transcription factors recognise sites in dsDNA, with <em>DNA-binding domains<\/em>. The rest of the protein might surround (partially, to varying degree) the negative outer surface of the dsDNA double helix with positively-charged surface, in order to hold it on to DNA as it scans (perhaps) along its length.<\/p>\n\n<h3>DNA-binding domains: major groove<\/h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bhP4s.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The following domains are found in many transcription factors, and they all recognise <strong>both<\/strong> strands. More correctly, they recognise <strong>basepairs<\/strong> and their orientation. <a href=\"http://voh.chem.ucla.edu/vohtar/spring05/classes/153B-1/pdf/lecture20.pdf\">The first 5 pages of this lecture slideshow<\/a> demonstrate that the chemical groups on the side of basepairs, accessible in the major groove, allow proteins to distinguish A:T, T:A, C:G &amp; G:C <em>by the order of hydrogen-bond donors, acceptors, and a methyl group<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, TFs recognise a sequence of basepairs - <em>oriented<\/em> such that one strand is (e.g.) p<strong>T<\/strong>p<strong>C<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong>p<strong>G<\/strong>, and the complementary strand is p<strong>C<\/strong>p<strong>T<\/strong>p<strong>G<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong>; and the bulk of the protein may 'sit' on one strand or the other - or a nearby gene may locally define one strand or the other as the coding strand <strong>but this does not mean that this one strand is read.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger\">Zinc fingers<\/a> probe the major groove with reading helices.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix-turn-helix\">Helix-turn-helix motifs<\/a> do much the same.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper\">Leucine zippers<\/a> also do much the same.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These are common domains that all recognise basepairs in the major groove by interactions with residues on a probing aplha-helix.<\/p>\n\n<h3>TATA-binding protein: minor groove<\/h3>\n\n<p>TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a different, interesting case. It binds the 'TATA-box' via the minor groove, where the exposed chemical groups only distinguish [A/T] from [C/G], but not their orientation. This means that the sequences on each strand cannot be easily read from the minor groove. TBP instead recognises the shape and flexibility of the double-helix at the TATA-box, 'grips' it by the minor groove and bends the DNA, which aids the melting of the strands to the transcription 'bubble'.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZzUnX.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The TATA-box sequence is usually p<strong>T<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong>p<strong>T<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong>p<strong>A<\/strong> <em>on the coding strand upstream of the transcriptional start.<\/em> This is the <strong>convention<\/strong> when giving the sequence of a TF-binding site, <em>but you couldn't say that TBP actually reads TATAAA - it doesn't!<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://classes.biology.ucsd.edu/old.web.classes/bibc100.SS03.1/pdf/ch32_transcription.pdf\">Here is another, similar set of lecture slides.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26806/\">Even better, here is the same material covered in a popular textbook.<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":30425,"question_id":30418,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1426524821},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1426596236,"creation_date":1426497228,"body":"<p>Addition to the answer provided by Teige.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transcription factors bind to both the strands however your question also included proteins in general.<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA remains double stranded and twisted as helix most of the times; most proteins bind to both the strands as mentioned in the previous answer.

It is recommended as the method of choice for the untrained rescuer or those who are not proficient because it is easier to perform and instructions are easier to give over a phone. In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compression-only CPR by the lay public has a higher success rate than standard CPR. The exceptions are cases of drownings, drug overdose and arrest in children. Children who receive compression-only CPR have the same outcomes as those having received no CPR. The method of delivering chest compressions remains the same, as does the rate (at least 100 per minute). It is hoped that the use of compression-only delivery will increase the chances of the lay public delivering CPR. As per the American Heart Association, the beat of the Bee Gees song \"Stayin' Alive\" provides an ideal rhythm in terms of beats per minute to use for hands-only CPR. One can also hum Queen's \"Another One Bites The Dust\", which is exactly 100 beats-per-minute and contains a memorable repeating drum pattern. For those with non cardiac arrest and people less than 20 years of age, standard CPR is superior to compression-only CPR.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The American Heart Association has assembled some efficacy testing studies in the following review article, <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/117/16/2162.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hands-Only (Compression-Only) Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Call to Action for Bystander Response to Adults Who Experience Out-of-Hospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest<\/a>. Importantly, the human clinical studies reported no significant difference between those who received conventional cpr and those who received compression-only CPR. Some animal efficacy studies are noted, and with respect conventional CPR, the animals that didn't receive \"rescue breaths\" experienced a lower survival rate. In the end they note some limitations to hands-only CPR:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...raised concerns about the possibility that recommending hands-only CPR for witnessed sudden cardiac arrest will, in fact, increase the complexity of decision-making for bystanders or that unresponsive victims of noncardiac medical emergencies (eg, drowning, drug overdose) will not receive rescue breathing.\"<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\"There may be situations in which ventilation alone could be life-saving but is not provided. There may be an interval after cardiac arrest when ventilations become absolutely critical for survival.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And as to the content in the second paragraph of the original post,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It is important to acknowledge that during cardiac arrest without lung inflation and ventilation, there is a continuous decrement of blood oxygen saturation. At some point in time, the possible hemodynamic advantage conferred by continuous chest compressions (without ventilations) will be offset by this reduction in oxygen saturation, and the ultimate result will be a compromise in oxygen delivery. One porcine cardiac arrest study (3 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, then 12 minutes of CPR) suggests that after 4 minutes of continuous chest compressions without rescue breathing, the delivery of 2 rescue breaths every 100 compressions provides a survival advantage over chest compressions alone.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The paradigm, again, is that hand-only CPR provides opportunity to get some help, other than no help at all, but the review also notes that more clinical data is needed on all fronts.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30442,"question_id":30434,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1426538476}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30434/is-hands-only-cpr-as-effective-as-traditional-cpr","last_activity_date":1426538476,"creation_date":1426347267,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is hands-only CPR as effective as traditional CPR?","body":"<p>Is hands-only CPR as effective as traditional CPR ?

As a start, you should have a look at <em>Species Distribution Models<\/em> (SDMs) using regressions models or Maxent, and the paper by <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Elith et al. 2009. Species Distribution Models: Ecological Explanation and Prediction Across Space and Time. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics Vol. 40: 677-697\">Elith et al (2009)<\/a> is a good starting point and a standard reference. SDMs using maxent is now a common approach, which integrates species occurrences as point data along with environmental layers (e.g. temperature, moisture and topography) to predict species distribution maps, and this can also include absence data or \"pseudo-absence\" data (randomly sampled data from a region of interest). The maxent software is described and can be downloaded here: <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/<\/a>\nA common criticism against distributions produced by Maxent is however that they ignore e.g. species interactions, and they only considers the species occurences and the environmental variables that has been included in the model.<\/p>\n\n<p>In your \"<em>Note<\/em>\", you touch upon the issue of detectability, which is an important issue that has received much attention recently. The problem is largest when you only have presence data, and to have real presence/absence data is preferable. Even if you don't have real absenses (the species has been searched for but not found), an estimate of sampling effort in different areas is still very useful, since this means that you can at least evaluate whether absenses is due to \"real\" absense or lack of sampling. In your case, the movement paths of characters could be used as a measure of spatial \"sampling effort\". The main issue with detectability in studies of distribution of species trends is if there is trends or bias in detectability, which means that apparent changes over time or patterns in distribution might be due to differences in detectability and not real differences between areas or over time. This could for instance be the case if observers are more likely to spot a species in one type of habitat (open savannah) then in another type of habitat (closed forest).

To clarify, this is a world where despite magical occurrences, the world itself is almost entirely non-magical. 'Alternate history magical realism,' perhaps. i.e., unlike, for example, Harry Potter, in which almost all plant and animal species mentioned are fictitious and magical, this series uses real flora and fauna. This allows me to extract information about the fictional world's environment based on the distribution of these animals, by assuming that similar animals will live in similar climates on Earth and in the fictional world.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ignoring the likelihood that the original author did not put enough thought into worldbuilding to make this a necessarily reasonable endeavor, my idea for how to proceed was as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>As maps exist of the fictional world, and the path of the characters can be plotted, I hoped to mark every mention of a specific plant or animal in the text, along with the location of the characters when it occurred, and from this reconstruct a plausible distribution for each species. I've created a theoretical example (in photoshop), for illustration:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/40E5V.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where the red dotted line represents the paths of various characters, the orange, green, and blue splotches represent the true distribution of the species; the stars, triangles, and circles represent the locations at which a species is mentioned; and the brown, green, and blue lines represent the reconstructed contours of the distribution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there a method to do such a reconstruction? It sounds a bit like a Monte Carlo analysis, but I figured I should check... (It also sounds rather like the magical programs detective shows use to plot serial killers' locations)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:<\/em><\/strong> It should be clear from the problem statement that just because a species is not mentioned at a specific location does not mean that it does not exist there. i.e., a sample at a specific location returning only 'A' - 'Bill and Jeff saw a lemur.' - does not exclude the possibility of 'B' and 'C' also at that location, but not sampled. Just because the text may specifically say that Bill and Jeff saw a lemur, and doesn't mention any other flora or fauna doesn't mean we should assume that they are in a universe devoid of anything but the occasional lemur.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Final Thoughts:<\/em><\/strong> Ideally, the analysis method would further:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>take into account the coverage of the paths, and not assume that (in\nthe example above) nothing exists in Mexico or northern Canada, just\nbecause there are no samples taken there. Remember that samples can\nonly be taken along paths.<\/li>\n<li>take into account edges, in this case coastlines. If A, B, and C are\nland animals, it does not make sense that a reconstruction of their\ndistribution would include water, even if their range surrounds a\nlake or something.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long-winded explanation.

Calmodulin is a small, acidic protein involved in the regulation of many cellular processes controlled by Ca2+-dependent signalling pathways. It is possible that binding of signal peptide fragments to calmodulin influences Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent cellular signal-transduction pathways. Further studies are required to elucidate the physiological consequences of interactions between signal peptide fragments and calmodulin.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The signal peptides of MHC class I proteins are presented to NK cells by MHC-I (with HLA-E alpha chain). This allows monitoring of MHC-I expression, which is often disrupted in virally infected or cancerous cells.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Peptides presented by classical MHC class I molecules represent the broad spectrum of peptides generated by the proteasome. In contrast to this general use of peptides, only a very specific signal peptide fragment is presented by so-called nonclassical MHC class I molecules (HLA-E in human). These molecules monitor the presence of classical MHC class I molecules by presenting a signal peptide fragment derived from HLA-A, -B or -C to natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. 5b). NK cells destroy cells unable to activate inhibitory receptors specific for MHC class I molecules. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This book section discusses the function of signal peptides in some viruses:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6322/\">Kapp K, Schrempf S, Lemberg MK, Dobberstein B. 2009.

All cows, wild and domesticated, will only lactate in the period between their calf's birth and weaning. Milk is calf-food, and when there's no calf, there's no evolutionary advantage in producing milk. <\/p>\n\n<p>On dairy farms, cows are milked twice daily, from spring (when they give birth) until late autumn. This mechanical milking 'fools' the cow into continuing to lactate. When a cow has stopped lactating, they will only start again after giving birth. This means that you can't just start milking a cow and expect to get milk.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally farmers milk their cows from spring (birth) until late autumn. The reason for stopping in autumn is simply because the grass grows much slower in winter, so there isn't enough food to support lactating cows. However, it is entirely possible to milk longer than a year; I know of farmers who milk their cows continuously for two years. These farmers will have to purchase a lot of supplimental food (like hay or silage) during winter. The advantage of milking for longer than one season is that the cows do not have to give birth every spring, but instead only every second spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe (but can't guarantee) that in winter, most milk purchased in a shop comes from the opposite hemisphere.

If you let the DNA by itself, it will adopt an $Lk=x$, i.e. it will be in his \"relaxed\"-form.

From there it can potentially reach all tissues.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, a pain response does not act as a chaperone. A hypothetical drug that would home in on tissues with a pain response, while avoiding unaffected tissues would be the ultimate painkiller, if it existed.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong> To emphasize that painkillers act systemically I will elaborate on aspirine's pharmacokinetics. Notably, aspirine's actions are <em>not<\/em> restricted to the pain centers in the brain, and I quote the following excerpt from Wiley's interactive Concepts in Biochemistry]<a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/legacy/college/boyer/0471661791/cutting_edge/aspirin/aspirin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aspirin's analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects are due to the drug's ability to stop the production of prostaglandins that cause <strong>tissue swelling and pain<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Aspirin's antipyretic (fever-reducing) effect is due to its direct action on the <strong>hypothalamus gland<\/strong>, which results in vasodilation of peripheral blood vessels and sweating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prostaglandins are also the key mediators of <strong>platelet aggregation<\/strong>. By modifying the COX enzymes within platelets, aspirin causes platelets to lose the \"stickiness\" that is needed to stimulate blood clotting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, by these examples it can be seen that aspirine works in the <strong>periphery (wound swelling and pain)<\/strong>, <strong>centrally (brain's hypothalamus)<\/strong> as well as in the <strong>bloodstream<\/strong>. Hence, aspirine (and other orally administered painkillers) do <em>not<\/em> target specific areas in the body, and most certainly not only the brain.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are such targeted drugs, however. An interesting one is carbamezipine, an anti-epileptic that blocks Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels. It blocks Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels only when they are in an active conformation, however (i.e., engaged in action potential firing). Epileptic activity is basically paroxysmal (massive), synchronous over-activity in the brain that is accompanied by massive Na<sup>+<\/sup> channel activity. Hence, epileptic activity will in effect trigger the drug into action.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":30384,"question_id":30379,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1426169749},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxxEx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13072,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13072/corvus","reputation":1501,"display_name":"Corvus"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":30387,"edited":false,"creation_date":1426144046,"comment_id":50134,"body":"Can you add more information on distribution of COX2 in the body and if possible pharmacokinetics of any of these drugs to explain how they may affect different body parts differently."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"post_id":30387,"edited":false,"creation_date":1426144063,"comment_id":50135,"body":"This does not provide an answer to the question.

In applications using B-gal as a reporter (lacZ gene), two lactose analogues are commonly used: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-gal\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-gal<\/a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortho-Nitrophenyl-%CE%B2-galactoside\" rel=\"nofollow\">ONPG<\/a> (as pointed out by @Alan Boyd). Both substrates are colourless, becoming coloured once hydrolyzed by B-gal. The formation of this colour allows B-gal to be assayed by means of either visual inspection, or more accurate means by using a spectrophotometer or camera.<\/p>\n\n<p>When X-Gal is hydrolyzed, an insoluble blue dye is formed. Evolution of blue colour is intensified as more substrate is hyrolyzed, allowing for quick blue/white screening by visual inspection in common applications of cloning and gene expression. Using the X-gal substrate, B-gal assays are more sensitive to gene expression (the dye precipitates out and retains colour very well), however X-gal is not quantitative (<a href=\"http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00036/BTN_A_04365PT03_O_36496a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Möckli &amp; Auerbach. BioTechniques 36:872-876 (May 2004)<\/a>). In contrast, ONPG hydrolysis evolves a soluble yellow dye. This colour developement is quantitative, however is less senstive than X-gal because the linear relationship betwen light absorption (at 420 nm) and substrate concentration is small. Using ONPG as a B-gal substrate allows for quantitative measurement of B-gal activity (and therefore promoter activity). (Note that ONPG itself is not capable of inducing the lac promotor, unlike X-gal.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Luciferase reporters (there are actually a few different luc genes) operate in a similar fashion. The enzyme cleaves its substrate, however instead of yielding an insoluble blue dye, emits a characteristic photon. Luciferase activity must be measured using specialized camera hardware to detect and count photons emitted from your yeast clones. This assay will still answer yes/no reporter questions, but can also be quantified to look at how much the reporter was activated. Luciferase activity is a quantitative reporter while also yielding spatiotemporal information.<\/p>\n\n<p>The choice of reporters depends largely on the question you wish to answer. If promoter induction is relevant (eg, the stress-response promoter was activated), then luciferase or B-gal with X-gal are best suited for their higher sensitivity. Given that luciferase requires a special camera and optical filter (such as a gel documentation system), X-gal is ideal because it may be screened by eye. If promoter activity is being assayed, then B-gal+ONPG or luciferase will yield quantitative measurements of reporter gene activity, and require at least a spectrophotometer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given these are university labs, I assume that materials costs are to be minimized and ease of experimental protocol to be maximized, B-gal is the ideal reporter.

I've seen too many gene therapy papers try to get away with using it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Beta galactosidase is not a good reporter gene for in vivo gene delivery studies. There is too much endogenous activity in most tissues to distinguish the exogenous activity. When doing non viral gene delivery, the amount of DNA expressed is often so low that you cannot overwhelm the endogenous activity and therefore cannot conclusively say the enzyme activity you detected is from your new DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Luciferase is far superior for in vivo work. First, there is no endogenous luciferase activity in most animals ( you're out of luck if you're doing work on fireflies ) so you can be sure that any luciferase activity you detect is real. Luciferase activity can be determined noninvasively though bioluminescent imaging, allowing for repeated measurements on the same animal. Beta glucosidase can require killing the animal, dissecting the tissues, preparing microscope slides, and then analysis, so doing a time course study will require using many more animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only advantage I can see beta glucosidase having over luciferase is if you want to see what percentage or precisely what type of cells are expressing the reporter gene. However, I think GFP or another fluorescent protein would be more appropriate because of the endogenous activity issue I described earlier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, my answer applies for animal use. If you're just growing yeast on a plate, the beta galactosidase is probably the cheaper way to go. We did some 384 and 1536 well plate assays on primary hepatocytes with luciferase, and the luciferase reagent was about $250 for 10mL. You might also consider fluorescent proteins for screening. I've made bactieral colonies with RFP that were visibly red, so no need for UV, but even if you need UV light to see the fluorescence, a standard UV transluminator for viewing gels will be good enough, and no extra reagents to add.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20734,"question_id":5383,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5383/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-beta-galactosidase-compared-t","last_activity_date":1426136632,"creation_date":1354234402,"answer_count":3,"title":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using beta-galactosidase compared to luciferase as a reporter gene?","body":"<p>In the University labs, we have used Beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene to quantify the expression initiated by the stress-response promoter in yeast.

My guess is that the first tube contains the radio labeled GTP and the second does not, so even the DNA is there, you cannot see it - even though the question specifically asked why DNA was not synthesized, my opinion is that it's a tricky question to confuse you.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the second problem we need to dig into the replication process a little bit:<\/p>\n\n<p>In the replication fork the two strands are synthesized differently. The so called leading strand is made continuously, without interruptions, however the other strand - the so called lagging strand is synthesized by ligating small fragments - aka Okazaki fragments. These small fragments require their own RNA primers that need to be removed after synthesis is done.\nNow since the origin of replication is in the middle and replication can proceed both ways, on a linear fragment such as yours you can get two 2000bp fragment from the two leading strands. Would it be a circular DNA, then you could still get 4kbp fragments since the replication could go around the DNA circle.\nThe smaller 500bp fragments that are quite abundant in the tsr1 lane, are the fragments that cannot be ligated. That being said I must admit that 500bp Okazaki-fragments would by atypical for eukaryotes (usual is around 100-200bp). So the enzymes responsible for this could be:<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA Ligase - the one responsible for ligating (joining ) the lagging strand's fragments.\nPolymerase delta (Pol δ): That is responsible for lagging strand synthesis and primer removal - in this case the primer removal function might be defective, this causes that the primers stay on the DNA and complete synthesis and ligation cannot occur.\nThe last protein although it is not quite an enzyme is the DNA clamp complex (PCNA). This complex stabilizes the polymerase to DNA, but when reaching a previous fragment the polymerase should dissociate. But if the clamp is dysfunctional than the polymerase gets stuck on the end of the fragment thus no primer removal and ligation can occur.<\/p>\n\n<p>If need more info read this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki-page<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30348,"question_id":30340,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1426099279}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30340/dna-sequencing-problem","last_activity_date":1426099279,"creation_date":1426085621,"answer_count":1,"title":"DNA sequencing problem","body":"<p>First off, let me start by outlining the problem:<\/p>\n\n<p>Your laboratory has established a technique for examining DNA replication in a cellular extract. To the cellular protein extract, you add nucleotides, a small amount of radiolabeled 32P-dGTP to aid visualization of the synthesized DNA, and a 4000-base-pair linear double-stranded DNA molecule that contains an origin of replication in the middle. After allowing the reaction to proceed for 30 minutes at 30°C, you boil the mixture to denature the proteins and the DNA strands, separate the components on an acrylamide gel, and detect the radiolabeled DNA products.

Linneaus' original system was based on flower morphology, but we since realized that the most effective taxonomy takes into account many different traits. In today's times, we mainly use DNA sequencing to determine relationships between organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) The leaf structure is not necessarily only optimized for maximum photosynthesis rate. For instance, the leaves of cacti are spines: thin and pointy to minimize water loss and defend the plant. In fact in cacti the stem is the photosynthetic part of the plant, not the leaves. More generally, leaves may be thicker or thinner to cope with drought. You can check out the wikipedia page for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_leaf_area\" rel=\"nofollow\">Specific Leaf Area<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long story short: different plants grow in different environmental conditions, so the optimal leaf shape for any one plant depends on conditions like drought and shade.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) There are many advantages that can be conferred by leaf shape. One example is how leaf shape can affect what is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer\" rel=\"nofollow\">boundary layer<\/a> of the leaf.

The miRNA is originally double-stranded and composed of strands about 21 nucleotides long; on loading onto RISC, one strand is degraded and the other, the \"guide\" strand, is held on the surface of RISC where it can interact with mRNA. The targets recognized by the guide strand are most commonly on the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of an RNA.  Binding can suppress assembly of an initiation complex on the 5' cap of an mRNA because the mRNA is bound into a circular shape at the initiation of translation, bringing the 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR close together.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the RISC loads an RNA than then finds a perfectly complementary target, RISC cleaves the target RNA using the activity of one of the protein components of RISC called Argonaute.  This property is exploited experimentally by manufacturing small interfering RNAs (siRNA) intentionally targeted to particular target sequences.  Once loaded into RISC these siRNA might recognize and cleave their perfectly complementary target sequence within an mRNA (though there is a significant failure rate, so several sequences are often tried).  The siRNA will also have miRNA-like effects on some partially-complementary targets on various mRNAs, leading to the observation that a single siRNA sequence can modulate expression of hundreds of off-target genes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Antisense is a nucleic acid strand (or nucleic acid analog) that is complementary to an mRNA sequence.  Antisense occurs naturally and can trigger RNA degradation by the action of the enzyme RNase H.  Originally natural antisense RNA was tried as a method for silencing a gene, but the poor stability of RNA in cells led to development of nucleic acid analogs that are more nuclease resistant and still activate RNase H (such as phosphorothioate RNA) and other nucleic acid analogs that bind to RNA and sterically inhibit processes without activating RNase H (such as 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA, Morpholino oligos, locked nucleic acids, or peptide nucleic acids).  These latter RNase-H independent oligos do not trigger degradation of mRNA but they can be used like molecular masking tape to block translation, alter splicing of pre-mRNA, inhibit activity of miRNA, block ribozyme activity, and interfere with various other processes that require some other factor to bind to a particular sequence on an RNA molecule.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30341,"question_id":30335,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30335/what-are-microrna-sirna-and-antisense-rna","last_activity_date":1426086464,"creation_date":1426083048,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are microRNA, siRNA and antisense RNA?","body":"<p>From what I understand, microRNA binds to proteins which can cut certain mRNA strands do that this protein is not synthesised.

On the contrary, the problem is that it not a scientific hypothesis and so it really isn't a scientific question.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If I may, the basis of the scientific method, as formulated by Karl Popper, but commonly in use today, is that science is the putting forth of theories of cause and effect which are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testability\" rel=\"nofollow\">testable<\/a> (or if we are being precise, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\" rel=\"nofollow\">falsifiable<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>That is to say, you put forth a theory such as 'God/some diety figure made all living things' and then you perform an experiment which can differentiate whether the hypothesis or its null version (i.e. 'no intelligence is the source of life / biology is the result of accidents') is more likely true.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This question will not be testable in a way to answer enough of the reasonable skeptical questions ( or at least so far it has not).  Experiments have been tried, but they are often not acceptable to everyone.  For instance the idea that some biological structures such as the eye or the flagellar motor are too complex to have evolved through a typical Darwinian process which involves a series of small changes are almost biological theology - one can always hypothesize a more inhuman God (probably appropriate) who acts and 'thinks' in such an inhuman manner that anything you see could be created/inspired.  While I think you should feel free to believe either way, I also believe that this is not an argument that can be won or lost.  The tendency for any experiment to confirm both the hypothesis and its inverse seem inescapable.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That is to say, that biology and physics will ultimately fail where philosophy and logic also did in proving the existence of God, besides the less interesting truism that if God does exist, the deity is consistently elusive to proof.  <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other side of the coin, the proof that life has emerged from naturally occurring phenomena such as lighting strikes in a prebiotic environment are interesting since it shows that nucleotides and amino acids might have been available without metabolic pathways to synthesize them.  In its way, the molecular origins of life on earth is a question which is really testable only in theory.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyone who thinks they are going to re-create the event of the beginning of life itself is scientifically on thin ice - the prebiotic environment may have extended to the entire surface and atmosphere of the earth as well as down into mud and bodies of water and sat incubating for maybe hundreds of millions of years.

Those who don't choose to believe in God will often argue that it is a non-issue. But is it a non-issue because they are so obviously right that others have no right to voice their opinion, or because it doesn't matter? The former is a very childish view, and certainly isn't very helpful if the goal is to convince others of the \"correct\" view. And if it simply doesn't matter to Atheists, then surely we can all recognize that it matters quite a lot to others. I'm not suggesting that theists simply be allowed to rewrite the curriculum (which some have attempted), but this is a question which costs more time and energy to ignore than to address. And we have a lot to learn from each other in the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many people, as they study evolution, very naturally begin to conclude that life could have, and therefore must have, emerged entirely by accident. This is not so different from observing that autism diagnosis has been on the rise since about the same time a certain vaccine came into widespread use, and the fact that symptoms often set in shortly after said vaccine has been given, and concluding that increased cases of autism could have been, and therefore must have been, caused by the vaccine. There is an appearance of a causal relationship, but the conclusion does not exactly follow from the evidence. In the case of the vaccine suspicions, I'm grateful that they have been solidly proved false now.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the true origin of life, many of us think we know the answer. Be that as it may be, this answer is not delivered to us through the study of evolutionary biology. Anyone who tells you that science has <em>proved<\/em> that we did in fact evolve without any external manipulation into what we are today, or that life emerged completely by chance, is misinterpreting the facts (or more likely, believing a rumor they heard). Anyone who tells you that science has proved the opposite, that life could not have emerged by chance, is likewise not following the logic correctly (or more likely, favors different rumors). I think that it would be a healthy exercise of critical thinking to open up this kind of discussion in a high school biology classroom, consistently reinforcing the fact that none of it on either side of the argument offers any conclusive evidence on the actual true origin of life. People who feel passionately either way on this must cringe a little at this suggestion, perhaps comparing it to the way Fox News feigns a \"fair and balanced\" presentation by presenting the plain and obvious truth on equal footing with an extremist view. But which is the extremist view on this issue? It depends on where you stand.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem I foresee is that most of the instructors are so strongly biased one way or another, that they would have a hard time honestly mediating such a discussion.

It probably won't open anyone to new thinking on the origins of life, but hopefully, it will help them resist the next vaccine scare. And it will help them to distinguish scientific proof from speculation or belief. For many religious students, this will allow them to digest the rest of the material without feeling like it is an attack on their sacred beliefs.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14244,"question_id":9085,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1396021270},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8ac30c9dc7eb4a49374189ee91d4301?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9612,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9612/techzen","reputation":191,"display_name":"TechZen"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1412397001,"creation_date":1412397001,"body":"<p>The problem with Intelligent Design is that it doesn't appreciate that the forces that shape species (and individual organism) have to be constant and ongoing or the species disappears. The past matters little, it's what happens right here, right now that keeps species in any particular form. <\/p>\n\n<p>Biological system are not static structures like a building. You put energy into a building when you move and shape it material during construction. Immediately though, the energy in the structure begins to flow out into the ambient environment, causing the building to loose it's structure and decay. Eventually it will fall to dust. <\/p>\n\n<p>Biological systems are dynamic, not static. A living organism is like a whirlpool.  A whirlpool is a complex ordered structure that dissipates energy caused by friction between streams moving at different velocities next to each other.  It is never composed of the same molecules of water from moment to moment and once water has passed through the whirlpool it never returns. The whirlpool is the structure, not the transitory water.<\/p>\n\n<p>Changing the rate of flow, depth of the water, temperature etc changes the exact structure of the whirlpool instantly. <\/p>\n\n<p>Biological systems are non-material structures like whirlpools. Matter and energy constantly flows into and out of bodies. We stop stop breathing, we die. Your body, even scars and bones are continuously begin torn down and regenerated. The average half life of atoms in your body is seven years. Even atoms that do remain in the body are moved from molecule to molecule and from tissue to tissue. Only the pattern remains semi-constant.

An unbiased,\n  informed Devil's advocate, if you will.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>My cursory investigation of what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbluTDb1Nfs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stephen Meyers (video link)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_XN8s-zXx4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Behe (video link)<\/a> say (correct me if I'm wrong) seems to be that either the first cell was likely designed intelligently judging by the complex code of DNA and that evolution took course from there, or that the first cells were made and many instances of evolution were from some kind of intelligently guided mutations as was needed to make \"irreducibly complex\" cells or body functions (whether the guidance stops after the Cambrian or continued even to the point of making different types of new bacteria and different types of apes/humans or whether every single mutation and adaptive ability is being guided, I'm not sure if they're at any consensus, and that's why I don't know if I should stop my question at abiogenesis or include evolution). The person I spoke with also brought up some specific claims (everything looks designed, DNA has ordered, complex information, blood clotting is irreducibly complex, ID can and has make predictions like decades ago that \"Junk DNA\" wasn't junk) that I don't need you to debunk (I have Google).<\/p>\n\n<p>But if there could be any possible support or truth to any of the above, I would appreciate knowing about that. (Again, Devil's advocate so I can be informed and understand where the points come from.) Reading an ID book alone, it would be in places hard to know where they differ from actual scientific conclusions. After all, when someone who <em>seems<\/em> to know what they're talking about and can explain something in technical detail says that something is impossible or extremely unlikely, it's hard for me to know why they would be wrong (are they ignoring other possibilities? misrepresenting facts? are they really right and just getting the cold shoulder from an atheistic scientific community because it implies a deity?). So I focus on mainstream sources, even if they don't bother entertaining ID and leave me ignorant of its possible virtues. And thus I'm hoping someone from this informed community might enlighten me to what those possible virtues might be.<\/p>\n","question_id":9085,"tags":["evolution","abiogenesis","molecular-evolution"],"score":6,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":518,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1374199061},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQCSr.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14874,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14874/piper","reputation":108,"display_name":"Piper"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":30313,"edited":false,"creation_date":1426047574,"comment_id":49989,"body":"Looks like you planned to put up a pic but it is missing"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl6dm.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13496/cdb","reputation":1164,"display_name":"CDB","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1426037133,"creation_date":1426037133,"body":"<p>I have never heard of larder beetles carrying any serious diseases and chances are slim that it could have laid any eggs, so you probably have nothing to worry about.

There are several ways this could happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>One extremely simple example would be based on a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR).  GPCRs are a family of related signal transduction proteins (the largest family) that sit on the surface of a cell's membrane.   Each one is sensitive to a molecule or small group of related molecules.  When exposed to the molecule it is sensitive to, the GPCR sets of a series of chemical cascades that trigger some activity in the cell.  For example, it can serve as a signal for the cell to move towards the place where the chemical was detected, or move away.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, imagine that, just by chance, the molecule the GPCR is sensitive to has some sensitivity to light, in that when exposed to light the molecule either has a larger or smaller chance (even slightly) of binding to the GPCR.  This is not improbable, a ton of biological molecules have this characteristic, in fact many have substantial responses to light even though they are not involved in light-sensing pathways.  A good example is called \"photoisomerization\", where the same molecule can have more than one shape, and switches between two shapes when exposed to light.<\/p>\n\n<p>This would be a biological light sensor.  Not necessarily a very sensitive one, but once you have such a basic light sensor, natural selection would take over and lead to stronger and stronger effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, this is pretty much how our eyes work today.  It uses a GPCR whose target is a molecule that changes its shape when exposed to light, which makes it no longer able to bind to the receptor, shutting of the signaling cascade.  What is more, this molecule is not only used in sensing light, it is a precursor to a molecule needed for gene transcription and signaling.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, you can splice light-sensitive GPCRs from bacteria (which are different than those in animals) into non-light-sensitive animal cells, and those molecules will automatically integrate with existing GPCR signaling cascades, rendering the cell light sensitive.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30288,"question_id":30282,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1425992179}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30282/what-is-the-minimum-functional-biological-light-sensor","last_activity_date":1425992179,"creation_date":1425967708,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the minimum functional biological light sensor?","body":"<p>As a follow up to this <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30214/what-is-the-minimum-eye\">question<\/a> regarding the evolution of the eye, it was suggested that primitive eyes only needed to evolve a light sensor and could perhaps use the existing biochemical cascade infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is the minimum of this biological light sensor?

What you call misproduct is actually a right product for a different substrate. The enzyme has a low specificity; but you won't say hexokinase is error prone because it has wide substrate specificity. The question is \u2014 is specificity critical?<\/p>\n\n<p>Coming to the example of DNA polymerase, you should note that DNA polymerase only adds a nucleotide to the DNA strand. Here the template DNA strand acts like a co-enzyme and it is the template DNA that provides specificity to the reaction. In this case the specificity is really critical and there are mechanisms that help in ensuring that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other enzymes also make errors and the probability of making errors depends on different parameters. Take the example of restriction enzymes that are supposed to cut at a specific site. When this specificity is lost we say that the enzyme is showing a \"star activity\" i.e. non-specific cleavage. This depends on different parameters such as buffer composition, enzyme concentration etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general specificity is provided because of high affinity of binding towards one molecule compared to the other. These binding reactions are second order \u2014 a high affinity substrate will bind to the enzyme even at a low concentration, however if you increase the concentration of the low affinity substrate or the enzyme, then at some point the rate of binding may be significant enough to create a \"wrong\" product.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes there are cases where the enzyme can bind to a wrong substrate but cannot create a product. This is the typical case of a competitive inhibitor. It is also possible that a certain molecule is good at binding but the conversion rate is slower.<\/p>\n\n<p>To conclude, these kinds of \"errors\" happen with many enzymes but it is very critical in case of DNA polymerization. You can get information on star activity of restriction enzymes (just google it). <\/p>\n","answer_id":30044,"question_id":28584,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1425202157},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07af3e370d8d6c2beed5e20616deaaad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12942,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12942/efrem","reputation":83,"display_name":"efrem"},"score":0,"post_id":30051,"edited":false,"creation_date":1435588082,"comment_id":58316,"body":"Thank you very much for your answer.

It's a useful lie, and one without which the equally useful field of taxonomy would be impossible, but a lie all the same. Every living thing is ultimately a unique individual unto itself. We group these individuals up and call them things, according to things that are more or less arbitrary, and we arrange these groups into bigger groups and fill books upon books with this method, because it makes it super easy to get a good overview of how life developed.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if we want to understand the details, we have to see past species, and look at the lineages.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The shark, our ancestor<sup>1<\/sup><\/h2>\n\n<p>One such lineage that is of interest is that of the shark. Sharks are <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Evolution\">ancient<\/a><\/em>: They are roughly as old as plants, and older than almost all land fauna. They are vicious, unrelenting killing machines, and all but perfectly suited for being this, with their sleek shape, their conveyor belts of teeth, and rough skin. At some point way back when, however, the lineage of sharks split in two: One branch that leads to fish, amphibians and eventually dinosaurs, squirrels and dolphins, and one that leads to sharks. The forebear to all these things were the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_fish#Jawed_fish\">early cartilaginous fish of the Cambrian ocean<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer the question as posed, we have to compare the success factors of the two lineages.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why sharks are still around as living fossils<\/h2>\n\n<p>The real answer here is that, in a very real sense, they aren't. Modern sharks are no more alike their long-dead forebears than squirrels are. However, the biological niche inhabited by sharks (apex predator) is a successful one, and sharks, already existing in this niche, have had successful children, made more successful by being superficially and behaviourally <em>alike<\/em> to their parents, and so, the modern shark presents as a living fossil.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why shark contemporaries are <em>not<\/em> still around as living fossils<\/h2>\n\n<p>The real answer here is that, in a very real sense, they are. Morphological differences aside, squirrels are no more different from their long-dead forebears than sharks. Rather, crowded niches have made generation upon generation of increasingly squirrely animals more successful by being superficially and behaviourally <em>different<\/em> from their parents, and so, modern squirrels have arisen.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong> Footnotes:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The shark is not in fact our ancestor, rather <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_fish#Jawed_fish\">Cambrian early jawed fish<\/a> are.

One striking use of this technology is to restore vision in the blind by making the surviving neurons in the retina light-sensitive. This can be done by transfecting the retina with genetically engineered viruses that induce the expression of bacterial <em>channelrhodopsin<\/em> proteins in retinal neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p><br> \n<strong>Background<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>I will explain optogenetics by focusing on one of the most striking applications: to make the blind see. In humans light is sensed by <strong>photoreceptors<\/strong> in the retina (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27833/parallels-between-pixelized-image-and-the-human-retina/27854#27854\">see further reading #2<\/a>). Rods infer grey-scale vision (i.e., night vision), while cones provide color vision when there is enough light available. Rods and cones contain light-sensitive proteins: the <strong>photopigments<\/strong>. The pigment in rod photoreceptors is called <em>rhodopsin<\/em>, in cones they are referred to as cone pigments, which are used for color vision. When light hits the rods and cones, the photopigments catch the light and activate a cascade of second messenger reactions, eventually causing hyperpolarization of the membrane. This hyperpolarization in turn activates secondary neurons in the retina, which eventually carry the receptor signal to the brain, where it is processed and used to generate a visual percept. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Light sensing<\/strong> across single-celled and multicellelar animals is mediated by two large families of proteins: the <em>opsins<\/em>. Opsin genes are divided into two distinct superfamilies: microbial opsins (type I) and animal opsins (type II). The rohodpsin and cone pigments found in humans belong to type II. Among other differences, type I opsins are bound to ion channels, while type II is not. Type II opsins therefore need a battery of intracellular <em>second messenger<\/em> molecules to operate. In contrast, the type I opsins, being channel proteins, directly cause intracellular changes by changing the membrane potential upon activation due to ion flow. Type I opsins, being channel proteins are referred to as <strong>channelrhodopsins<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In retinal degenerative diseases such as <em>retinitis pigmentosa<\/em> (RP) the photoreceptors degenerate and patients eventually loose their vision. The secondary neurons in the retina, however, partly survive. As explained above, these secondary neurons are responsible for processing the photoreceptor signal and sending it to the optic nerve. Hence, although RP patients miss the photoreceptors, the rest of the visual pathway is ready to rock! Hence, somehow these neurons should be activated. There are a battery of approaches to do just this. Retinal implants activate the neurons directly by electrical activation (<a href=\"http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/9272/does-the-retina-encode-visual-information-like-a-bitmap-or-an-svg\">see further reading #3<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Optogenetics<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-061010-113817\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fenno et al., 2013<\/a>) is another approach where the secondary <strong>surviving neurons are made photosensitive<\/strong>, thereby bypassing the photoreceptors by turning the secondary neurons into photoreceptors. The neurons are made photosensitive by making them express channelrhodospins. This is done by injecting a viral vector into the eye such that the virus infects the retinal cells. Instead of a viable virus, however, it is tinkered aound with and the only thing the virus does is incorporate the channelrhodopsin into the genome of the neurons, which start to express it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Channelrhodopsins<\/strong> are cation channels, and therefore, upon light activation, they allow positively charged ions (notably Na<sup>+<\/sup>, but also Ca<sup>+<\/sup>) into the cell. This <em>depolarizes<\/em> the neuron and can induce action potential firing (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/91/how-do-the-brain-and-nerves-create-electrical-pulses/110#110\">see further reading #1<\/a>). Action potentials is the neuron way of transmitting signals to the brain. Hence, by activating the secondary neurons through channelrhodopsin transformation, they start sending light-induced neural activity to the brain. The brain will handle this input as if evoked by photoreceptors and hence will interpret it as light-evoked visual stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to cancer: It has been shown that expression of channelrhodopsin and illumination of whole-mice resulted in diminished subcutaneous cancer cell counts <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-061010-113817\" rel=\"nofollow\">(yang et al., 2013)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to your first added question: dependent on the exact peptide regulatory sequences added to the protein, or by using viral vectors specifically targeting axons, <strong>expression of channelrhodopsins can occur wherever one likes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your second added question: Cation channels activate neurons, anion channels inhibit them.

You basically just need a protein that is light-sensitive and some cascade of signal transduction. A light-sensitive protein is just a protein which conformation is changed in the presence of photons of a given wavelength. This cascade of signal transduction can be very standard. It doesn't need to be anything extraordinary.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider a mutation that turns a given protein into a light-sensitive protein. Such mutant protein could easily still activate the same cascade (and eventually regulate the expression of the same gene) and may eventually be beneficial. A visual signal (presence/absence of photons of a given wavelength) directly affect the conformation of the protein which in result can activate a whole cascade.

This is primarily because the drugs act on different sets of muscles. If a adrenergic stimulator - phenylephrine is instilled with a muscarinic stimulator - cyclopentolate, both sets of muscles will be acted upon and based on the concentration of the drugs, the decay rate and the efficacy, the iris diameter will either increase or decrease to variable degree. The point is that both the drugs will affect the final diameter of the iris (which is based on the autonomic state of the patient and the strength of drugs administered)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the special cases will be to administer a inhibitor of a receptor followed by an stimulator of the same receptor or vice-versa - In this scenario, the duration of action and the affinity of the given drugs to the receptor in question will play a decided role in determining the final action as both drugs act on the same muscle. If the inhibition is permanent or long-acting then inhibition of the muscle action is predominant. This may change if the stimulator has a very high affinity to the receptor - Higher affinity will result in tighter binding of stimulator and remove the chance for the inhibitor to work - i.e. increase the probability of the clearance of inhibitor. As you can see from above statement, if the clearance rate of inhibitor is slow (takes too long to metabolize), then the effect will ultimately be inhibitory effect. Similarly in case of poisonings where the stimulating effect is permanently achieved (Organo Phosphorous poisoning will cause permanent damage to acetylcholinestrase the enzyme responsible to remove acetyl choline) the reversal will depend on the affinity of the inhibitors (in this case, of acetyl choline) to the receptors (muscarinic). <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus the question must be more specific to get a proper answer, as <strong>the effect is totally dependent on the drugs administered.<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":27574,"question_id":2902,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1421311886}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2902/does-a-mydriatic-drug-neutralize-the-action-of-a-miotic","last_activity_date":1425901692,"creation_date":1342343157,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does a mydriatic drug neutralize the action of a miotic?","body":"<p>If a person were administered a mydriatic, would the subsequent application of a miotic neutralize the action of the former?
