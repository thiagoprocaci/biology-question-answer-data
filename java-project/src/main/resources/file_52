But there was just a great recent study published in Science (I'll go find it), in which a group looked at plaque deposition as a proxy of overall cardiovascular health of groups of mice exercised before and after food intake. They find that exercise under fasting conditions, which would be akin to morning running, appears to be significantly more protective against cadiovascular disease than exercise after feeding. This is also consistent with some human data suggestive of fasting exercise benefits as well. In a separate experiment the mice were fed the same number of calories per day, but those that were exercises after sleep and before eating were significantly leaner and had less plaque deposition in their vasculature. <\/p>\n\n<p>In part the idea is that after a period of fasting exercise will promote scavenging of residual cholesterols in the vasculature as well as cellular autophagy (which promotes \"fixing\" of current cells rather than just replacing them). To the layman, Resveratrol from red wine is probably the most commonly known way in which autophagy might be promoted.

Limb development was suppressed because of repression of Dll. By contrast, the misexpression of onychophoran and crustacean Ubx proteins did not interfere with Dll expression and the formation of thoracic limbs. These results raised the possibility that the Drosophila Ubx protein is functionally distinct from Ubx in onychophorans and crustaceans. One study suggests that Drosophila Ubx has acquired an alanine-rich peptide that mediates the repression of gene transcription; this peptide is lacking in onychophorans. The other study provides evidence that the crustacean Ubx contains an additional peptide that modulates the activity of the alanine-rich peptide, and possibly other repression domains, in crustacean Ubx.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MxsdA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Insect-restricted sequences include four regions N-terminal to the\n  homeodomain (I1\u2013I4), a peptide motif (QAQAQK), and an extended run of\n  alanine residues C-terminal to the homeodomain<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The onychophoran Ubx protein might function as an activator of appendage development.

To show why, McElreath &amp; Boyd (\"Mathematical Models of Social Evolution\", p. 242) draw the following graph:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XwPCE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Let $V(X|Y)$ be the payoff of individual $X$ when it interacts with $Y$ (in other words, $X$ is the focal individual; $Y$ is the other individual). I understand that McElreath and Boyd calculated the regression coefficient by computing $V(C|D) - V(D|C)$ --- as opposed to $V(C|C) - V(D|C)$, where you keep the strategy of the other individual constant. My question is <strong>why<\/strong> this is the right way of calculating $\\beta(w_i,p_i)$.<\/p>\n","question_id":34088,"tags":["evolution","natural-selection","mathematical-models","population-genetics","evolutionary-game-theory"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1431158247},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d05aa613943f97474588aab01b269886?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15684,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15684/davis-piris","reputation":4,"display_name":"Davis Piris"},"closed_date":1431236734,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":34109,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431143822,"comment_id":54433,"body":"Depends on the species.

I know that sounds obnoxious, but it's very important in evolutionary biology to understand that there is no agency and no intended final product for natural selection. I think the best way to think about it is like this: let's say there's a mutation on the X chromosome that happens to make females more fit at the expense of making males less fit. It seems possible that the evolutionary arms race that this establishes (i.e., males bearing a mutation that compensates or overcompensates for the new expense of the mutation that, say, their successful mom gave them, would then start to sweep to fixation in the population, and so on and so on) could result in population collapse.

Also, I vaguely remember a paper about toxic sperm (vs. female mating behavior) in Drosophila melanogaster suggesting that populations could collapse.

Therefore, the only likelihood for the recombination to occur is for the cell line expressing the virus to undergo replication with an active, wild-type HIV strain. An example is this <a href=\"https://www.addgene.org/10878/\">pLKO transfer plasmid<\/a>, which contains a truncated 3' LTR, preventing the sequence from replicating outside of <em>E. coli<\/em>, which replicates it not using the LTR but instead using the plasmid origin of replication. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Are the active viruses produced by recombinations more dangerous in the wild than wild type HIV?<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is difficult to answer, since recombination only allows an active virus to form, but it does not guarantee that the virus will be dangerous. Dangerous viruses are theoretically possible, but require far more recombinations than the minimal 2 for replication competency in 2nd generation lentivector systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, lentivector systems generally do not encode for the viral proteins <em>vpr, vif, nef<\/em> and <em>vpu<\/em>. These proteins are necessary for increasing the infectivity of HIV in different types of tissues (but not cultured cells such as HEK293). The lack of these proteins in a hypothetical replication competent lentivector would significantly hamper its spread in the wild. Incorporation of these proteins is plausible but extremely unlikely, since more crossover recombination events will be required. <\/p>\n\n<p>To use your example, the <em>env<\/em> protein coding for the VSV protein coat resides in the envelope plasmid. Since the replication competent lentivector formed by 2 recombination events will be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotyping\">pseudotype<\/a> containing only the HIV <em>env<\/em> proteins, it will need to further acquire the VSV gene to replace its <em>env<\/em> proteins, since these genes are not present on the same regions. There is no homology between the two DNA strands, which would significantly hamper the likelihood of the VSV gene somehow being incorporated into active HIV. <\/p>\n\n<p>The addition of various chimeric proteins and LTR regions in 3rd generation lentivectors only complicates the matter. <\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, I was unable to find any sources comparing the infectivity of these theoretical transgenic HIV versus the wild type. However, even though it is theoretically possible that a transgenic replication competent lentivector can have better tropism than HIV by acquiring the VSV gene, the likelihood of that occurring is far lower than that of it being produced in the first place. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Can a lentivector be detected by a HIV test?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Regarding the final question of whether a lentivector can be detected by a standard HIV test, the answer is that the detection is possible if the person who was infected with lentivectors, has obtained an immune response to the lentivector gag proteins, and the lentivector loads are high enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>HIV tests are specific to different parts of the virus, but <a href=\"http://i-base.info/guides/testing/appendix-1-different-types-of-hiv-test\">most of them target<\/a> the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P24_capsid_protein\">viral protein p24<\/a>, which is a component of the <em>gag<\/em> polyprotein. <\/p>\n\n<p>PCR based HIV tests also exist, but these tests would depend on the specific primers produced and whether the RT-PCR would produce an amplicon given the specific sequence of the plasmids. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since gag genes <a href=\"https://www.addgene.org/lentiviral/packaging/\">are encoded for in most lentivector systems<\/a>, it is therefore very likely that anyone infected with a lentivector would therefore express antibodies towards p24, and therefore result in a positive for the ELISA as well as the Western blot tests assuming that the p24 and antibody quantities are high enough to reach the cutoff point. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was unable to find publicly available cutoff levels for the ELISA and Western blot levels, but if (hypothetically speaking) a person was injected with a load of lentivectors, they would likely test positive for HIV. However, since the lentivector is not actively reproducing, it would quickly be cleared out by the immune system. <\/p>\n","answer_id":34070,"question_id":33001,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1431064884}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/33001/lentivector-biosafety","last_activity_date":1431064884,"creation_date":1430757796,"answer_count":1,"title":"Lentivector biosafety","body":"<p>Lentivectors are widely used in molecular biology, most commonly to transduce in a stable way a desired gene. These vector system takes advantage from the ability of viruses to introduce their own genome in the host cell. Thus the lentivectors are transfected to a producer cell line (typically HEK) and there viruses are produced with the desired insert. Eventually this viruses will be harvested and the desired cell lines transduced.<\/p>\n\n<p>For bio-safety reasons, this system is engineered in a way that that the risk posed by the \"virus system\" is reduced. Thus the viruses produced by this system are incapable of replication, meaning with this that, as far as I understood, the viruses that are formed are then unable to form more in the second host as the genes in charge are not recruited. Yet, apparently the plasmids used can recombine and pose a possibility to create a replicating capable virus.

Second question, taking into consideration all of this, <strong>this theoretical \"created\" virus would be able to eventually cause AIDS or other whatever adverse effect?<\/strong> it is noteworthy that now is able to infect almost all human cells due to the VSV protein, then is it correct to think that the disease would be much worse, and much more contagious than the original HIV? note that even the stability is increased. <\/p>\n\n<p>Yet, I can additionally think that this recombinant new virus may be indeed destroyed by the immune system, despite the increased tropism, due to the fact that vesicular stomatitis virus does not cause pathologies in humans, and possibly this protein works as an antigen and can induce an enough immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last, <strong>would theoretical recombinant virus be detected by a standard HIV test?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To simplify things, I am referring to third generation lentivectors <\/p>\n","question_id":33001,"tags":["virology","lentivirus"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":34070,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":179,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1431026517},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzWBX.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15536,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15536/eepperly16","reputation":185,"display_name":"eepperly16"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":0,"post_id":34075,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431019096,"comment_id":54325,"body":"A changing concentration gradient of Na+ and K+ means that these ions are flowing and thus there is a flow of charge, which is the definition of electric current.

The fluorescence encodes the different base types. To achieve high throughput, millions or billions of sequencing reactions are performed in parallel in microscopic quantities on a glass chip, and for each micro-reaction, the label needs to be recorded at each step in the reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means: the sequencer takes a digital photograph of the chip containing the sequencing reagent. This photo has differently coloured pixels which need to be told apart and assigned a specific colour value.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QuyzW.png\" alt=\"Digital image of a sequencing chip\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, this (strongly magnified) image (fragment) is very fuzzy and most of the dots overlap. This makes it hard to determine which colour to assign to which pixel.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Base calling<\/h1>\n\n<p>One such image is registered for each step of the sequencing process, yielding one image for each base of the fragments. For a fragment of 75, that\u2019d be 75 images.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have analysed the images, you get colour spectra for each pixel across the images. The spectra for each pixel correspond to one sequence fragment (\u201cread\u201d) and are considered separately. So for each fragment you get such a spectrum:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gq5fd.jpg\" alt=\"Base calling spectrum\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Now you need to decide which base to assign for each position (\u201cbase calling\u201d, top row). For most positions this is fairly easy but sometimes the signal overlaps (towards the beginning in the above image) or decays significantly (near the middle). This has to be considered when deciding the base calling quality (i.e. which confidence you assign to your decision for a given base).<\/p>\n\n<p>Doing this for each read yields billions of reads, each representing a short fragment of the original DNA that you sequenced.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alas, this was the easy part. Most bioinformatics analysis starts here; that is, the machines emit files containing the short sequence fragments. Now we need to make a <em>sequence<\/em> from them.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Read mapping and assembly<\/h1>\n\n<p>The key point that allows retrieving the original sequence from these small fragments is the fact that these fragments are <em>randomly distributed<\/em> over the genome, and they are <em>overlapping<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next step depends on whether you have a similar, already sequenced genome at hand. Often, this is the case. For instance, there is a high-quality \u201creference sequence\u201d of the human genome and since all the genomic sequences of all humans are ~99.9% identical (depending on how you count), you can simply look where your reads align to the reference.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Read mapping<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is done to search for single changes between the reference and your currently studied genome, for example to detect mutations that lead to diseases.<\/p>\n\n<p>So all you have to do is to <em>map<\/em> the reads back to their original location in the reference genome (in blue) and look for differences (such as base pair differences, insertions, deletions, inversions \u2026).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0jP4H.png\" alt=\"Mapped reads\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Two points make this hard:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You have got <strong>billions<\/strong> (!) of reads, and the reference genome is often several gigabytes large. Even with the fastest thinkable implementation of a string search, this would take prohibitively long.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The strings don\u2019t match precisely. First of all, there are of course differences between the genomes \u2013 otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t sequence the data at all, you\u2019d already have it! Most of these differences are single base pair differences \u2013 SNPs (= single nucleotide polymorphisms) \u2013 but there are also larger variations that are much harder to deal with (and they are often ignored in this step).<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the sequencing machines aren\u2019t perfect. A lot of things influence the quality, first and foremost the quality of the sample preparation, and minute differences in the chemistry. All this leads to <em>errors<\/em> in the reads.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In summary, you need to find the position of billions of small strings in a larger string which is several gigabytes in size. All this data doesn\u2019t even fit into a normal computer\u2019s memory. And you need to account for mismatches between the reads and the genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this still doesn\u2019t yield the complete genome. The main reason is that some regions of the genome are highly repetitive and badly conserved, so that it\u2019s impossible to map reads uniquely to such regions.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, you instead end up with distinct, contiguous blocks (\u201ccontigs\u201d) of mapped reads. Each contig is a sequence fragment, like reads, but much larger (and hopefully with less errors).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Assembly<\/h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to sequence a new organism so you don\u2019t have a reference sequence to map to. Instead, you need to do a <em>de novo assembly<\/em>. An assembly can also be used to piece contigs from a mapped reads together (but different algorithms are used).<\/p>\n\n<p>Again we use the property of the reads that they overlap. If you find two fragments which look like this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>ACGTCGATCGCTAGCCGCATCAGCAAACAACACGCTACAGCCT\nATCCCCAAACAACACGCTACAGCCTGGCGGGGCATAGCACTGG\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>You can be quite certain that they overlap like this in the genome:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>ACGTCGATCGCTAGCCGCATCAGCAAACAACACGCTACAGCCT\n                  ATCCCCATTCAACACGCTA-AGCTTGGCGGGGCATACGCACTG\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>(Notice again that this isn\u2019t a perfect match.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So now, instead of searching for all the reads in a reference sequencing, you search for head-to-tail correspondences between reads in your collection of billions of reads.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you compare the <em>mapping<\/em> of a read to searching a needle in a haystack (an often used analogy), then <em>assembling<\/em> reads is akin to comparing all the straws in the haystack to each other straw, and putting them in order of similarity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1873,"question_id":1859,"up_vote_count":46}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1859/what-exactly-are-computers-used-for-in-dna-sequencing","last_activity_date":1431019734,"creation_date":1334744735,"answer_count":4,"title":"What exactly are computers used for in DNA sequencing?","body":"<p>I've thoroughly read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing\">the Wikipedia article on DNA sequencing<\/a> and can't get one thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's some hardcore chemistry involved in the process that somehow splits the DNA and then isolates its parts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yet DNA sequencing is <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/\">considered to be a very computationally-intensive process<\/a>.

This causes the change in the meaning of the triplet, and can ruin stop codons that would affect the translation of the mRNA but not the transcription of the gene to mRNA.It is important to understand that transcription is a countinous process and the DNA is transcribed from base to base not in triplets, and that transcriptions stop is not encoded in the from of stop codon.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34049,"question_id":34044,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1430942706},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dITzT.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14698,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14698/sleepses","reputation":532,"display_name":"Sleepses"},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b4833d86d3cccc3ccfd6eeaf0b767e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14946,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14946/mdperry","reputation":2645,"display_name":"mdperry"},"score":1,"post_id":34050,"edited":false,"creation_date":1430996279,"comment_id":54310,"body":"The untranslated region (UTR) isn&#39;t translated by the ribosomes (hence its name), and therefore contains no reading frames, because it is never &quot;read.&quot;  Without a frame, the term &quot;frameshift&quot; mutation does not have a clear sense.

If you go on google scholar and look for any empirical paper in the field of evolutionary biology such as \"does sexual selection has antagonist effect to natural selection\", \"evolution of range limits\", \"evolution of mutational robustness\" or \"sensory drive speciation\" you will find tons of papers that test hypotheses. Many of these hypotheses have been developed either in pure theory papers on in papers that mix some level of theory (no necessary need of complicated modelling) and empirical work. There is nothing in evolutionary biology that is different from the other field of biology or the other fields of science in our ability to test hypotheses.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>A tiny bit of history<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In the first half of the century most work in evolutionary biology was theoretic. Many hypotheses were left untested. Today, we perform lots of tests and the technics of molecular genetics (sequencing and stuff) help a lot to test hypotheses. Some papers, indeed uses metrics that are very hard to estimate, eventually too hard (too expensive) to be estimated today, it is true and it is an issue, an issue that all sciences know of.

Wrigth in 1932. As said on the wiki article, there is little empirical evidence for shifting balance theory (but you may want to read <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/253/5023/1015.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00033.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">that<\/a>). The reason is that shifting balance theory is link to the concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive landscape<\/a>. Adaptive landscape is what we call the relationship between fitness and phenotype or fitness and genotype. We have descriptions of fitness-phenotype relationship but we are only starting to offer good and complete descriptions fitness-phenotype-genotype relationship. Understanding the link between genotype and fitness is essential for testing shifting balance theory. Shifting balance theory is a logical consequence of the process of drift and selection, both of which are very well known (and well tested). Most of the issue is in the description of how rough is the fitness landscape to know whether shifting balance theory is indeed a thing that occurs in nature or whether it is very unlikely of such process to ever occur.<\/p>\n","answer_id":33034,"question_id":33011,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1430923357}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/33011/are-there-any-examples-of-how-to-apply-evolutionary-models","last_activity_date":1430923357,"creation_date":1430783574,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any examples of how to apply evolutionary models?","body":"<p>Apologies if this question it too open-ended; evolutionary biology is not my primary field.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have been reading a lot about the use of statistical mechanics in analyzing evolutionary dynamics.

There are tens of thousands of genes in a typical eukaryotic genome, and depending on tissue types and environmental conditions, these genes are turned on and off in a very controlled manner. There is regulation at every point in the flow of genetic information: nucleosome disruption to expose DNA; RNA transcription from the DNA; protein translation from the RNA; and in some cases, additional modifications of proteins or intermediate mRNAs. At early stages in development, regulation of RNA and protein levels is even more crucial than, say, when an organism is fully developed and healthy.<\/p>\n\n<p>All living organisms share some basic building blocks--DNA, RNA, and proteins work pretty much the same in all of life (there are a few rare variations of the genetic code but the basic premise is identical). However, the way that <em>specific<\/em> genes, transcripts, and proteins work together to sustain life varies widely between different organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a very rough analogy, imagine you want to bake a batch of cookies.

If you put the ingredients for both recipes in one bowl, it's likely you can still come up with some pretty good chocolate chip cookies in the end.<\/li>\n<li>You look at two different recipes: one for chocolate chip cookies, and one for chocolate muffins.

Of course there is natural variation in the population, but this doesn't typically lead to lethality during development. The second example we can relate to individuals of two related species (such as a horse and a donkey). Sometimes these matings can produce viable offspring, although these offspring are often sterile. The third example we can relate to individuals of two very divergent species (such as donkey and dog in your original question).

The accumulations of DNA, RNA, total protein, and proteolipid protein which accompany brain growth during this period were all approximately proportionately depressed by the oxygen-enriched atmosphere. RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios were unaffected. The increase in brain mass in the first week of life reflects mainly cell proliferation, and since the decreased DNA accumulation occurred with no changes in RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios, we conclude that the effect of oxygen was to inhibit cellular division. We estimate that the oxygen exposure caused an approximately 7 per cent deficit in the cell population of the brain. These results indicate that the use of elevated concentrations of oxygen may have serious deleterious effects on the growth and development of the brain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from:* Grave, G.

When there is excess salt in the extracellular fluid,the osmolality of the fluid increases, and this in turn stimulates the thirst center in the brain, making the person drink extra amounts of water to return the extracellular salt concentration to normal. This increases the extracellular fluid volume.\n2. The increase in osmolality caused by the excess salt in the extracellular fluid also stimulates the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary gland secretory mechanism to secrete increased quantities of antidiuretic hormone. The antidiuretic hormone then causes the\nkidneys to reabsorb greatly increased quantities\nof water from the renal tubular fluid, thereby diminishing the excreted volume of urine but\nincreasing the extracellular fluid volume.\nThus, for these important reasons, the amount of salt that accumulates in the body is the main determinant of the extracellular fluid volume. Because only small increases in extracellular fluid and blood volume can often increase the arterial pressure greatly, accumulation of even a small amount of extra salt in the body can lead to considerable elevation of arterial pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q2kTJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Progressive changes in important circulatory system variables during the first few weeks of\nvolume-loading hypertension.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27586,"question_id":5088,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1421082106},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/727e01cb0f5bb71084aa4a9ebd094c73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4433,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4433/jasand-pruski","reputation":550,"display_name":"Jasand Pruski"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1430698957,"creation_date":1421087573,"body":"<p>Salt will cause high blood pressure, <em>but only under certain circumstance.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>physiologic hormonal compensations for increased blood volume:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Atrial natriuretic peptide<\/strong> -- increases sodium excretion, hence this is <strong>INCREASED<\/strong> with high blood volume<\/li>\n<li><strong>Antidiuretic horomone<\/strong> -- ADH increases water reabsorption in the kidney, hence this will be <strong>DECREASED<\/strong> with high blood volume<\/li>\n<li><strong>Renin/Aldosterone<\/strong> -- increases sodium reabsorption from ultrafiltrate back into blood, hence it will be <strong>DECREASED<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>these explainations are a bit reverse (saying that these horomones have these effects and that is why they are released) for the sake of simplicity, and I'm not discussing the mechanism of release of these horomones (aka under what circumstances they are released in the place where they are released from)... <\/p>\n\n<p>while these horomones help with the kidney regulation of sodium balance and blood volume, this still depends on the kidneys being given the circumstance where they can be effective.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathologic circumstances, when elimination of excess sodium fails:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Some people simply have a higher sodium sensitivity and there are a variety of factors that have been statistically correlated to sodium sensitivity, but often the mechanism is unknown.

This occurs in congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A patient with congestive heart failure may not have adequate renal\nperfusion.  Hence, to maintain adequate blood pressure the renal artery is constricted.<\/li>\n<li>Also, liver cirrhosis may decrease renal perfusion\nbecause of the lack of blood proteins (proteins found inside the\nblood vessels that keep water in the blood vessels via osmosis)\nholding fluids in the intravascular space and having them escape into\nthe extra-vascular (outside the blood vessels but still outside the\ncells of the body) space. Again, to maintain adequate blood pressure the renal artery is constricted.<\/li>\n<li>burns, also because of loss of blood proteins--> leakage of intravascular fluid to extravascular space--> decreased blood volume and increased sympathetic nervous system output--> reduction of renal blood flow... same as for cirrhosis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In addition to reduction of salt in the diet, diuretics (ex. loop and thiazide) can help the body excrete even more sodium into the urine than what your body can do on it's own.<\/p>\n\n<p>this article describes the renal handling of excess salt in the diet:\n<a href=\"http://booksite.elsevier.com/brochures/thekidney/PDFs/TheKidneyCh36_P088488.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://booksite.elsevier.com/brochures/thekidney/PDFs/TheKidneyCh36_P088488.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":27624,"question_id":5088,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1430698957}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5088/how-does-sodium-in-ones-diet-affect-blood-pressure","last_activity_date":1430759505,"creation_date":1351792035,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does sodium in one's diet affect blood pressure?","body":"<p>Due to high blood pressure, my doctor has recommended I go on a low-sodium diet.

The myosin then hydrolyzes the ATP and uses the energy to move into the \"cocked back\" conformation. In general, evidence (predicted and in vivo) indicates that each skeletal muscle myosin head moves 10\u201312 nm each power stroke, however there is also evidence (in vitro) of variations (smaller and larger) that appear specific to the myosin isoform.\n  Steps 9 and 10 repeat as long as ATP is available and calcium is freely bound within the thin filaments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see ATP is essential in the release of myosin from actin. In case of muscle overuse and dehydration ATP is depleted from the muscle cells and may cause the muscle to cramp.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also according to <a href=\"http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/569/basics/pathophysiology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> site it is said that repetitive firing of motor units with high frequency is associated with muscle cramps, although tehe origin of this is yet not clear.

This template is essentially error free, as the levels of ROS generated, is very low. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mutations in DNA (mitochondrial or nuclear) in most cells in the body can be harmful to the health of the individual, but will have no influence on the next generation. The genes which we pass onto the next generation are separated off during early development into special \u2018germ line\u2019 cells which form sperm and eggs. Great care is taken to minimise the risk of mutation to these genes \u2013 genes in germline cells act as a blue print for the next generation. This is essentially why aging is not heritable, and it is a system that works pretty well.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Research has uncovered a rather elegant solution to this problem \u2013 those mitochondria that will be passed to the next generation are maintained in an inactive state.Mitochondria are only inherited through the maternal line \u2013 every mitochondria in your body came from your mother, and this is true for most animal species. The mitochondria in sperm are generally discarded at some point prior to fertilisation. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Membrane electrical potential, a measure of the activity of the electron transport chain, was reduced in oocytes compared to both sperm and the surrounding tissue. Further, ROS production was 50- and 100-fold lower in the eggs of fruit flies and zebrafish respectively.

You do something enough number of times, then that event ceases to be something new, and your body adapts to it.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case, you train your body to accept more risks allowing greater lengthening, before it begins to internally signal the muscles that an injury is incoming. <\/p>\n\n<p>Read below for the slightly longer version:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The stretching of a muscle fiber begins with the sarcomere, the basic unit of contraction in the muscle fiber. As the sarcomere contracts, the area of overlap between the thick and thin myofilaments increases. As it stretches, this area of overlap decreases, allowing the muscle fiber to elongate. Once the muscle fiber is at its maximum resting length (all the sarcomeres are fully stretched), additional stretching places force on the surrounding connective tissue. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>There are two kinds of muscle fibers: intrafusal muscle fibers and extrafusal muscle fibers. Extrafusil fibers are the ones that contain myofibrils. Intrafusal fibers are also called muscle spindles and lie parallel to the extrafusal fibers and are the primary proprioceptors in the muscle.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>When the muscle is stretched, so is the muscle spindle. The muscle spindle records the change in length (and how fast) and sends signals to the spine which convey this information. This triggers the stretch reflex (also called the myotatic reflex) which attempts to resist the change in muscle length by causing the stretched muscle to contract. The more sudden the change in muscle length, the stronger the muscle contractions will be (plyometric, or \"jump\", training is based on this fact). This basic function of the muscle spindle helps to maintain muscle tone and to protect the body from injury.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>One of the reasons for holding a stretch for a prolonged period of time is that as you hold the muscle in a stretched position, the muscle spindle habituates (becomes accustomed to the new length) and reduces its signaling. Gradually, you can train your stretch receptors to allow greater lengthening of the muscles.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can read more about it (including the role of the lengthening reaction by the gogli tendon organs) here: <a href=\"http://people.bath.ac.uk/masrjb/Stretch/stretching_2.html#SEC13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://people.bath.ac.uk/masrjb/Stretch/stretching_2.html#SEC13<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>It has also been published in a short section in this paper.

The energetic debris entering the ionosphere produces ionization and heating of the E-region. In turn, this causes the geomagnetic field to \u201cheave,\u201d producing a \u201clate-time\u201d magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) EMP generally called a heave signal.  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The same reference also indicates:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the region where the greatest damage can be produced is from about 3 to 8 km from ground zero.

While the frequency spectrum is admittedly different from nuclear weapons, victims of lightning strikes are surely subjected to greater magnitudes of EMP than those who managed to survive nuclear bombings (who suffered many other traumas, such as blast waves and radiation.) Those who survive the immediate physical (burns) and neurological (cardiac arrest) effects of lightning strikes must surely be knocked unconscious and be disorientated when they regain consciousness. But again, I am not aware of medium or long term memory loss being a particular symptom.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is worth comparing the structure of the brain (a fairly homogenous mass of tissue of high water content, relatively conductive) with the structure of electronic equipment (components of ever smaller size and greater resistance in order to save power, surrounded by a nonconductive medium such as air, and interconnected by wires, which serve to channel voltage.) It is unsurprising that the brain is less subsceptible to electrostatic damage than electronic components (electronics workers have to take precautions in order to avoid damaging sensitive components with static discharges from their bodies and clothing.) <\/p>\n\n<p>The most widespread damage to equipment caused by EMP is from the long-period pulses, which are channeled by electric cables. These act over distances much larger than the size of the human body.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the last reference:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...distortion of the geomagnetic field was observed worldwide in the case of the STARFISH test. ... the signal from this process is not large, but systems connected to long lines (e.g., power lines, telephone wires, and tracking wire antennas) are at risk<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first recorded EMP incident ... nuclear test over the South Pacific ... resulted in power system failures as far away as Hawaii.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm<\/a> mentions cases of damage caused by long period EMP, including electric shocks suffered by telegraph operators during solar flare events.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, any amnesia caused by EMP is likely to be caused by normal biological shock mechanisms to individuals unfortunate enough to be electrocuted, and not by any direct electrical effect on the brain itself.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23820,"question_id":23817,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1415450658},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93ad97cd6d264067b56ee1e08fa0b73d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/540/superbest","reputation":2283,"display_name":"Superbest","accept_rate":69},"score":8,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1415560909,"creation_date":1415560909,"body":"<p>The brain is not an electronic device.<\/p>\n\n<p>An EMP is basically a large amount of electrons flying by all at once. They are negatively charged, and as they pass by they distort your local EM-field (hence the name). This distortion induces current in the wires (a phenomenon known since Faraday) - since most wires aren't made with a large tolerance, the sudden current spike overheats the wire and burns components. In the brain, there are no wires to induce current on.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is true that electromagnetism plays a role in neuron function, and action potentials can be measured or manipulated with electrodes. However, this is just a consequence of the ion concentration being used for signaling - there is not a flow of electrons across a conducting wire that is driving the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Memory is not stored electrically. The two major mechanisms of memory are strengthening of the synapses and the chemical state of the neurons (metabolites and proteins such as cAMP or CaMK, RNA levels, DNA methylation). These aren't very sensitive to electrons moving past - you're essentially trying to catalyze a chemical reaction by applying a strong EM field outside of the beaker.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, I suspect the skull and tissue surrounding it may act as a Faraday cage to shield the brain itself from the EM field.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm sure it is possible to create an electron flux so heavy that it manages to induce enough current in cells to kill them (or current in your bloodstream to cause cardiac arrest). However, the nuclear explosion that produces this would probably be much deadlier due to other effects, like blast shockwave or gamma rays. So to answer your question, a nuclear EMP would either kill you or not affect your memories, although if you had some exotic, very powerful, very precise pure EMP generator perhaps you could get some sort of stunning effect or give people a headache.

This addresses the disconnect in cancer incidence with cell number in an organism. It goes something like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>Assume current oncogenesis theory to be correct in that mutation acquisition is the rate limiting step in creating a cancer, such that you need ~5 specific mutations in a single cell for that cell to be fully transformed into a cancerous cell. This then being the case, it is so rare that any cell can acquire all necessary mutations that in humans we don't see cancer incidence appreciably increase until the 5th decade of life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let's assume man has an average weight of 50kg and a blue whale has an average weight of 130000kg, with roughly equivalent lifespans. Assuming average cell weights are the same in both organisms, there are 2500X more cells in a blue whale than a human.<\/p>\n\n<p>If linear mutation rate is the rate limiting step in cancer then increasing cell numbers is akin to increasing the number of times you flip a coin to try and get heads, which means there is a 2500X greater chance of getting all ~5 necessary mutations in a single blue whale cell than in a single human cell. If human cancer incidence starts to spike at 50 years, this means blue whale cancer incidence should spike after 7 days and blue whales should largely be eliminated by cancers within the first month of life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully makes you question a bit what is causing cancer.\nMake sense?<\/p>\n","answer_id":31861,"question_id":31847,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d7c5cbd0c2f965a3712ff687c53f997?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14552,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14552/aaaaaa","reputation":2058,"display_name":"aaaaaa"},"score":1,"post_id":31862,"edited":false,"creation_date":1430339342,"comment_id":53735,"body":"i think question is about experiments that are contradictory, but haven&#39;t been refuted.

Nearly everybody experiences episodic tinnitus at one point or another.  When exposed to a loud sound or a blow to the head can cause it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Chronic tinnitus occurs when the sound does not go away and is heard all the time.  This is annoying but incredibly common - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0010394/\">nearly 1 to 2 in ten people have an extended period and about 0.5% of people experience tinnitus to the point where it affects their daily life and it doesn't seem to ever go away<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Like headaches, schitzophrenia, depression, and other neurological conditions, the specific cause of tinnitus is not really understood and explanations which are really satisfying are hard to imagine.  <\/p>\n\n<p>While a loud noise could possibly cause nerve damage in the auditory system, it sounds more often the cause is related to a vulnerability in the auditory system that allows the generation of these sounds in such a way that they cannot be tuned out. There have been <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/606554\">genetic factors associated with the tendency to tinnitus<\/a>, implying that physiological factors are in play. Tinnitis can be aggravated by stress, caffeine and smoking, which further implies that nerve physiology has a lot to do with the condition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Much of the treatment for tinnitus involves amplifying other sounds in other parts of the sound spectrum so that the ringing sound tunes itself out - that the nervous system actually attenuates the sound as it should so that the patient does not consciously register it. Hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy have also been touted as well as herbal remedies, diet changes, but attenuation is all the result that is typically expected.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There is a class of tinnitus where a pulsating sound from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18302544\">vasculature near the auditory nerves appears to be a cause<\/a>. <\/p>\n","answer_id":16379,"question_id":16327,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YtSF4.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5771,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5771/stords","reputation":729,"display_name":"stords"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1396852547,"creation_date":1396852547,"body":"<p>Apparently some (small amount of) tinnitus is caused by, or at least associated with, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoacoustic_emission\" rel=\"nofollow\">otoacoustic emissions<\/a>.

Therefore, data on temporary noise-induced tinnitus are scarce and confined to a small handful of studies done in the 1960's (<a href=\"http://www.audiologynow.com/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_03_03.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry &amp; Meikle, 2000<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>In one of these studies (<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/12000/Study_of_Tinnitus_Induced_Temporarily_by_Noise_.44.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atherly et al., 1968<\/a>) the authors exposed the study subjects to loud acoustic stimuli of various pure tones. The subjects reported to experience tinnitus pitched within a certain frequency band around the tonal stimuli received. The stimulus frequency and perceived pitch approached a 1:1 relationship, such that the tinnitus pitch was e.g. 4 kHz when the noise frequency was 4 kHz. Between-subject variability was, however, considerable. For example, at a stimulus of 6 kHz, the range of perceived pitch was 4-9 kHz.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The other study I found based on the review by Henry &amp; Meikle (<a href=\"http://www.audiologynow.com/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_03_03.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2000<\/a>) showed that the perceived <strong>tinnitus pitch increased<\/strong> when the frequency of the loud <strong>tonal stimulus or frequency content of broadband noise increased<\/strong> <a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/42/2/10.1121/1.1910600\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Loeb &amp; Smith, 1967)<\/a>. Basically this confirms the data from Atherly et al. (<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/12000/Study_of_Tinnitus_Induced_Temporarily_by_Noise_.44.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">1968<\/a>). However, the perceived pitch did not coincide with the stimulus frequencies, and there was considerable variability between subjects. For example, some subjects reported multiple frequencies in their tinnitus, some reported a hissing tinnitus, while others did not develop any tinnitus at all <a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/42/2/10.1121/1.1910600\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Loeb &amp; Smith, 1967)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In all, <strong>your suggested perceived tinnitus pitch of 17 kHz is unexpected<\/strong>, given that noise-induced hearing loss (by loud music exposure etc.) typically results in a <a href=\"http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0501/p2749.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">4-kHz notch<\/a> in the audiogram where hearing loss is greatest. Hence, tinnitus would be expected to occur around this frequency as well. But again, variability is very high and it may well be possible it is higher pitched in your case. Also note that 17 kHz is very high and near the upper audible frequency limit for humans (e.g., the sound an old CRT screen makes, i.e., hardly perceivable for many adults).<\/p>\n\n<p>Most research on tinnitus has been done regarding patients with chronic tinnitus complaints that suffer from sensorineural hearing loss (i.e., damage to the hair cells in the cochlea). Typically, the perceived tinnitus pitch in this group is associated with their hearing loss. In other words, the pitch of the tinnitus generally matches a frequency range within the region of frequency loss <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27898/can-humans-perceive-sounds-above-20-kHz?\">(Eggermont &amp; Roberts, 2004)<\/a>.     <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/12000/Study_of_Tinnitus_Induced_Temporarily_by_Noise_.44.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atherly et al., <em>JASA<\/em> 1968;<strong>44<\/strong>:1503-6<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.psychology.mcmaster.ca/hnplab/publications/TINS2004.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eggermont &amp; Roberts, <em>Trends Neurosci 2004<\/em>;<strong>27<\/strong>:676-82<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.audiologynow.com/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_03_03.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry &amp; Meikle, <em>J Am Acad Audiol 2000<\/em>;<strong>11<\/strong>:138-55<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/42/2/10.1121/1.1910600\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loeb &amp; Smith, <em>JASA<\/em> 1967;<strong>42<\/strong>:453-5<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further reading<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/3100/55\">What's the Frequency of the ringing in my ear?<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27898/can-humans-perceive-sounds-above-20-kHz?\">Can humans perceive sounds above 20 kHz?<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":30565,"question_id":7506,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1426767150}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7506/what-determines-the-perceived-pitch-frequency-of-tinnitus","last_activity_date":1430406011,"creation_date":1363064753,"answer_count":1,"title":"What determines the perceived pitch (frequency) of tinnitus?","body":"<p>I noticed that every time I suffer temporary tinnitus after going to a very loud concert, the frequency I perceive is identical.

As far as I understood, there seem to be \nas much cancer as there are patients diagnosed with cancer.\nWhich means that when a chemotherapy is prescribed, \neach chemotherapy should be tuned to the patient. However, even if custom made, the process of creating a chemotherapy might be automated, which would permit to drastically reduce the related cost. That's why my guess is that the price is driven by other causes, but I may be wrong.
