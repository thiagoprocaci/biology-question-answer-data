Go through some books that will guide in the basic understanding of biology.

It is a classic in first year Bachelor in biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have some specific questions, you are very welcome to ask them. But this post asks for a whole book!<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a small quickly written text that will maybe help you a bit. Note: it might be oversimplified sometimes!<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA is a big molecule made of (among other things) nucleotides. There are 4 nucleotides (adénine, cytosine, tyrosine (or Uracile on RNA) and guanine often just called ACTG and they can be categorized in two types of molecule depending on their number of cycles) which sequence form the genetic information. DNA, in eukaryotes (which are cells that contains DNA in a nucleus (which is the case of all non-virus, non-bacteria and non-archaebacteria)) is grouped into chromosomes (which are usually represented by a \"X\" as they more or less appears at the metaphase (a phase during the life cycle of a cell)).<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA is transcribed into mRNA (a kind of RNA) which is then translated into protein (by rRNA and tRNA). While RNA and DNA are made of nucleotides, the protein is made of amino acids. Three nucleotides (one codon) codes for 1 amino acid.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the genome there are sequences that code for proteins, sequences that code for RNA, sequences that allows other proteins to bind into in order to influence gene expression, promotors, enhancers\u2026 You will have to accept taking some time learning a bit about that stuff I guess.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sequencing is the (artificial) process of reading a DNA sequence. This can be achieved on a whole genome or on small chosen sequences.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the nucleotides G binds only with C and A binds only with T (two nucleotides together form a base pair)(there are two strands of DNA linked by the nucelotides), the amount of G equals the amount of C and same for A and T. The GC content gives the proportion of G and C of the total number of nucleotides of a sequence (or a whole genome). Oh by the way, a genome is the totality of the DNA of a given individual.<\/p>\n\n<p>Positive/purifying selection are cases of natural selection. Natural selection is a process by which the frequencies of alleles (variant of a gene) does not vary randomly. They vary according to the reproductive success (= fitness) they confer to the individuals that bear the allele. Positive selection on an allele means that this allele is selected for. Purifying selection refers to the wildtype allele (most frequent allele) is selected for and all mutations (DNA modifications) that appear are deleterious and therefore counterselected,<\/p>\n\n<p>A SNP is a genetic variation between individuals in a population (or along populations or species) that involves only one nucleotide.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13911,"question_id":13910,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1386868208}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13910/basic-definitions-for-biology-terminology","last_activity_date":1386868208,"creation_date":1386742662,"answer_count":1,"title":"Basic definitions for biology terminology","body":"<p>I am currently writing a mathematical biology paper, however it is very hard for me to follow the existing literature due to specialized terms.

They are optimized to grow slowly and have a large number of genes that can break down the unusual chemical compounds to grow in an inorganic often anoxic environment.  These bacteria have genes evolved from the chemautotrophic earliest days of life on earth.  They live deep within the earth, under ground, in volcanic vents.  There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_tube_worm#Energy_and_nutrient_source\" rel=\"nofollow\">animals that live in some of these environments<\/a>, but its simply too easy for these to use the bacteria that are already growing here readily rather then re-evolve the genes to do it by themselves. <\/p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotes are already symbiotes - they used bacteria to create ATP and photosynthetically fix carbon to the extent that they absorbed them as mitochondria and chloroplasts respectively.  If eukaryotes were under a tremendous amount of selective pressure, some of them might absorb symbiotic chemautotrophs, but without such pressure, it doesn't happen when you are competing against plants with roots and animals that eat for their energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Forming systems of organisms is much more stable than having individual species that can do it all.  This question is actually similar to other questions that ask why we don't have metal armor, run as fast as cheetahs, etc.  Evolution doesn't actually create super animals that are completely self contained.  The ones that reproduce the best are the ones that can actually spread out the risk of survival and contribute to an ecosystem.  <\/p>\n\n<p>It kind of makes me think of human beings - the only superorganism on the planet in this regard.

Though they may still grow with the same rate, there is a difference between mother and daughter cells due to accumulation of defects in old-pole cells over long times."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1386195098,"creation_date":1386195098,"body":"<p>First of all, in eukaryotes (as far as I'm aware), older cells can be distinguished from younger cells due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere\">telomere<\/a> shortening, so there is an ageing process. HeLa cells mentioned by @Gary Chou have a more active <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase\">telomerase<\/a> which mitigates telomere shortening, allowing cells to continue to divide indefinitely. I think it's a very interesting question whether this immortality eliminates any sense of \"older\" and \"younger\" cells from in HeLa cell culture. I suspect not, but I am not sure on the specifics. <\/p>\n\n<p>In general this question will depend on how an organism divides (we're going to talk single-celled organisms from now on). For example, the yeast <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae#In_the_study_of_aging\"><em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/em><\/a> is a budding yeast, which means that it divides by budding a smaller cell off of the larger cell. This clearly allows for an interpretation of \"mother cells\" and smaller \"daughter cells.\" Indeed, as lots of research on ageing in <em>S. cerevisiae<\/em> has shown, beyond being larger, the mother cell undergoes <strong>replicative ageing<\/strong>: over time the mother cell is less capable of growth and division--she gets old!<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting case of all (and maybe the one you had in mind) is when the organism divides symmetrically, like the bacteria, which undergo <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_fission#Binary_fission_of_prokaryotes\">binary fission<\/a>. For decades, as far as scientists could tell, the two cells that were the product of one bacterium dividing looked identical, and all measurements seemed to indicate that the cells were \"sisters,\" i.e. exactly the same, both newborn. So if in the right conditions bacteria could continue to divide indefinitely, it seemed that bacteria were immortal, since each division reset the ageing clock for each bacterium.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, a seminal study in 2005 <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030045\">(1)<\/a> changed this view. The researchers took time-lapse microscope movies of a colony of <em>Escherichia coli<\/em> from a single cell. <em>E. coli<\/em> is rod-shaped, so when it divides it has to synthesize two new ends or <em>poles<\/em>, one for each cell, so just after division each cell has a \"new pole\" that was made in the process of that division and an \"old pole\" which had originated before. In this study Stewart <em>et al.<\/em> kept track of the old poles in the growing colony, and they defined the age of a cell as the age of its old pole. They found that older cells (i.e. cells with older poles) displayed replicative ageing, just like yeast! They grew more slowly and were less capable of dividing. This was examined rigorously by Wang <em>et al.<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2810%2900524-5\">(2)<\/a> in a \"mother machine\" in which bacteria were able to grow in constant nutrient conditions (by flowing fresh media across them) in dead-end channels. The cell at the dead-end of the channel always inherited the old pole, and so was a \"mother\" to all future cells. They found that, while a cell line was able to grow for very long periods of time completely stably, after hundreds of generations there was an increased likelihood for the cells to display signs of stress. They attributed to the accumulation of toxic factors in the mother cell over time. So even in cells dividing by binary fission, there appears to be some difference between the two cells arising from the division, depending on how old the pole that they inherit is. <\/p>\n\n<p>These effects in bacteria are small, and require watching many generations to reveal. Even in light of these results many researchers will still call the \"mother\" cell the cell about to divide and the \"daughter cells\" the cells that result from division, implying that there is no difference between \"daughters.\" Stewart <em>et al.<\/em> claim that on the basis of their work this conception of bacterial division must be revised, and that instead of division producing two identical daughters, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the old pole cell should be considered an aging parent repeatedly producing rejuvenated offspring. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, they add a nice philosophical touch to their findings:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These results suggest that no life strategy is immune to the effects of aging, and therefore immortality may be either too costly or mechanistically impossible in natural organisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030045\">(1): Stewart EJ et al.

Killing the weakest, evolution wipes defective genes out of populations. <\/p>\n\n<p>The mutations are necessary for advance. However, they are random and, thus, mostly negative. Right? How does the nature eliminate them from the population? <\/p>\n\n<p>I see that one mechanism is polygamy: male have higher mutation rates. They tend to reproduce as much as possible. Female have lower mutation rates, they couple with only with best men and contribute much more to their offsprings. So, men generate as much random solutions as possible, whereas the role of female is to conserve the best of them. This means that the most of the male (bad mutations) die unreproduced. This eliminates the bad mutations and favours the progress of good qualities. The higher animals started to form harems and tournaments over their ownership. This further fosters the elimination of weak men and profileration of strong genes. However, human monogamy has disabled this selection mechanism. Best men are dedicated to only one woman. Other women cannot mix their genes with other good genes from previous generations. They are forced to look at the low quality men, who carry degenerate mutations. Might be it is monogamy that makes us human but it implies that all genes reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yet 100 years ago it was not a big deal since we still had another filter: our grandfathers were born in families that had normally 10 children (I am speaking about Russia) and only 2-3 survived until reproduction (the population increased really slowly). I bet that those who survived had really good health: thanks to the bad health and immense selection pressure, the negative mutants are eliminated immediately and population maintains a perfect genome (aka biologic health). Killing more weakest in the current generation improves the health of next generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>However everything has changed during the 20th century. The advances in economy and medicine have almost eliminated the selection. The selection pressure has relaxed to essentially zero so that everybody survives and leaves the same amount of offspring (and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgenics\" rel=\"nofollow\">some scientists are even concerned that degradatory individuals leave more offsprings than the prosperous ones<\/a>). We have even eliminated the infant mortality. We use baby incubators so that the people with the weakest health could survive and reproduce as normal and we are proud of it. It may sound strange but the mutation rate has not changed at all. Does it mean that the human genome is in danger?<\/p>\n\n<p>I see the situation like you have inherited a perfect mechanism and decided not recovering it from the inevitably adverse action of entropy, that degrades it constantly. There is a constant chance, <em>d<\/em>, that every good gene is affected by a mutation. It is a fraction of healthy genes that will fail passing to the next generation.

This is a general phenomenon of binding protein/ligand interactions; after the free ligand is gone, ligand that is released from the binding site usually finds another binding site before it encounters the dialysis membrane (28). We have determined empirically that binding the fusion to a chromatography resin and then washing away the maltose is much more effective. We prefer standard chromatography (e.g. DEAE) as the separation step, since it can separate the Factor Xa and MBP from the protein of interest. In case MBP co-elutes with the protein of interest, we include a large volume washing step to remove the maltose before starting the salt gradient. This way, the mixture can be run over an amylose column afterward if necessary. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, in summary they are suggesting that you bind the protein to an ion exchange column; wash with lots of buffer; then elute the cleaned-up protein (using salt or a change of pH  - you will have to know something about your protein's behaviour on the column to do this).<\/p>\n","answer_id":13802,"question_id":13801,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13801/removing-sugars-bound-to-a-protein","last_activity_date":1386164835,"creation_date":1386163583,"answer_count":1,"title":"Removing Sugars Bound to a Protein","body":"<p>I recently purchased some Maltose Binding Protein and as the name suggests this protein binds to maltose.

The fitness is usually defined as the number of offsprings an individual can sire in its lifetime. Most often we talk about relative fitness which is the relative number of offspring in an individual can sire in its lifetime compare to the individual in the population that sire the greatest number of offsprings.<\/p>\n\n<p>How would you compare fitness of individuals between different species? Just by counting the number of offspring they left behind? Or did you mean that most fit species are actually those species that can outcompete others? If yes, then I would say that saying<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two species that reduce one another's fitness on microevolutionary (short-term) timescales can increase each other's macroevolutionary (long-term) fitness<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>can be restated <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two species that reduce one another's fitness on microevolutionary (short-term) timescales can increase each other's macroevolutionary (long-term) species competition ability<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and it is actually just a special case of<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One species that evolve under many strong selection pressure ends up being a very competing species.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The explanation is the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>One species that undergoes one selective pressure, will see its genetic variance decreases. The weak individuals will disappear letting places to the strong individuals. Then newly arisen variance (mutation) will come up only in the strong individuals (as the other ones disapeared). This is what J.Gould meant by saying \"Natural selection creates the fit\". As a consequence a species that undergo many successive selection pressure will end up with purified and very strong genotypes while, in a species that were free to evolve without selection they would have evolved many different genomes with some good mutations nested in very poor genetic background.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could as well use the concept of lineage selection and states that lineage that succeeds to outcompete others will thrive while species that suffer from competition with other species will get extinct. As a result, if you compare all species that were in competition with another species in the past with all species that were not in competition, you will find out that those that were in competition are more resistant to competition. But I guess this is not exactly what you meant when saying: \"Two species that reduce one another's fitness on microevolutionary (short-term) timescales can increase each other's macroevolutionary (long-term) fitness\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally you might think of the ability of species to evolve better. This ability is called \"evolvability\" (see <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691134049\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book<\/a> for example). You might say that species that undergo many selection pressures were selected to resist to newly arisen selection pressure. As a result, species that are under competition might end up with a greater evolvability than those that were not under selection. Resulting that species that were under competition will tend to increase to always increase their fitness in the long term.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13668,"question_id":13664,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1385460910}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13664/natural-enemies-boost-deep-evolutionary-fitness","last_activity_date":1386102537,"creation_date":1385442096,"answer_count":1,"title":"Natural enemies boost deep evolutionary fitness?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Two species that reduce one another's fitness on microevolutionary\n  (short-term) timescales can increase each other's macroevolutionary\n  (long-term) fitness\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Opinions?<\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Intuitive Examples:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Body Size<\/strong> - Predator-prey relationships or interference relationships\n(fighting, e.g. for territory) are often documented to put seletion\npressures to grow in body size, often a positive feedback loop.

In this case, there is a single <em>gene<\/em> involved - <em>ABO<\/em>, which codes for an enzyme that modifies sugar groups on the surface of red blood cells. This <em>ABO<\/em> gene has three <em>variants<\/em> or <em>alleles<\/em> &mdash; <em>i<\/em>, <em>I<sup>A<\/sup><\/em>, and <em>I<sup>B<\/sup><\/em>. <em>i<\/em> (coding for Type O blood) is recessive, which means that its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotype<\/a> can only be observed if there are two copies of it &ndash; <em>ii<\/em> &ndash; one from the mother and one from the father. <em>I<sup>A<\/sup><\/em> and <em>I<sup>B<\/sup><\/em> are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_relationship#Co-dominance\" rel=\"nofollow\">co-dominant<\/a>, meaning that both can be expressed at the same time, and their phenotypes can be observed even if there is only one copy of that allele &mdash; for example, <em>I<sup>A<\/sup>i<\/em> would give Type A blood (as would <em>I<sup>A<\/sup>I<sup>A<\/sup><\/em>), <em>I<sup>A<\/sup>I<sup>B<\/sup><\/em> would give Type AB, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Major and minor alleles (at least in my mind) simply refer to the frequency with which an allele is found in a given population: a <em>minor<\/em> allele is one that is expressed less-often than a <em>major<\/em> one. The term <em>minor allele frequency<\/em> is sometimes used as a numerical representation of expression &mdash; a certain allele is only expressed in 3% of the population, for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>These terms are all from classical genetics &mdash; talking about genes and variants without really knowing (or needing to know) what exactly the gene was made up of. Of course, we now know that genes are composed of sequences of DNA nucleotide <em>base pairs<\/em> (A, T, C, and G), which are then translated by 3bp-<em>codons<\/em> into proteins, where each codon corresponds to one of 20 <em>amino acids<\/em>, plus <em>START<\/em> and <em>STOP<\/em> sequences. It is in this context of DNA sequence analysis that terms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism\" rel=\"nofollow\">SNP<\/a> or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism are used. If you were to compare two alleles, say <em>I<sup>A<\/sup><\/em> and <em>I<sup>B<\/sup><\/em>, any single-nucleotide difference between the two could be termed a SNP. Frequently, SNPs are often notated based on the changes the difference would bring to the translated protein sequence &mdash; for example, a AAG codon codes for the amino acid lysine, while GAG encodes glutamatic acid. In other cases, a SNP would make no difference to the protein sequence &mdash; for example, TTA, TTG, CTC, CTA, CTG, and CTT all encode leucine. You can find the DNA codon table <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should keep in mind that SNPs are not the only source of variation in genetic sequences &mdash; deletions, translocations, repetitions, inversions, frame shifts, and other mechanisms can all alter the DNA sequence at a particular <em>locus<\/em> or site.

I very welcome editing!<\/p>\n\n<p>As soon as an individual is killed, on might as well eat the dead, but the act of killing might not be for the purpose of eating. We might even say that eating a dead might not only be for the purpose of getting energy and matter but only to clean the living place. And killing might appear in many circumstances. The best way to consider such issue is certainly by using the quite fundamental model of kin selection theory. It fits as much to species that gain energy by eating the dead or not. The difference imply just a minor change in the payoff matrix.<\/p>\n\n<p>The decision of one (the actor) to kill (and eat) another individual (the recipient) depends on:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the relatedness of the actor to the recipient (note a relatedness is not necessarily symmetric)<\/li>\n<li>The competition this recipient causes on the actor<\/li>\n<li>The cost (energy cost, risk of being injured or killed) of killing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Many species (ants, wolves) might kill or injured individuals of the same species, when for example there is competition for reaching a status in the hierarchy.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that the definition of k-selected species is not very accurate. First because there are limit cases. But also because r and k can relate to the function that describes the population growth of a species or might describe the amount of energy the parents spend into one offspring which is not necessarily the same thing. If we think of the parental care, we can think of the lions. When a male win the right to access to the females of another male, he will kill the babies that might be potential competitors to his progeny (because they take energy from the females or because females are not fertile before having lost their babies).<\/p>\n\n<p>Killing its own offsprings is certainly not less common in k-selected species. You might think it is such a big cost to kill one of its own offspring when one has few offspring but what is important is to think in percentage. Killing 50% of the progeny has the same cost of an r-selected species than for a k-selected species.<\/p>\n\n<p>If one has a probability of 10% to be able to raise its offspring to adult age. But this probability raised to more than 20% if it accepts to kill an offspring to save energy for the next offspring, then it wins by doing so. THen we might ask: \"so would one make an offspring if it intends to kill it?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Well it does not necessarily intend to kill it. It might need to decide late in the season whether or not it has better to kill its own offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, maybe offspring might be used as a reserve of energy and matter for its siblings or for its parents.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13658,"question_id":13648,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13648/are-there-cannibalistic-k-selectors","last_activity_date":1386067109,"creation_date":1385328937,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there cannibalistic k-selectors?","body":"<p>My understanding of r- and k-selectors does not go deeper than the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia article<\/a>.

This network is continuously displaying some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">chaotic<\/a> (determinist but not foreseeable) behavior. In such a system it becomes very hard or practically impossible to predict what the impact of a change (even a minor one) might be. To illustrate, one could say that killing half of the world's lions might cause the population of rabbits in Norway (!) to increase but killing two thirds might cause the same population of rabbits to decrease. Note: Stuart Kauffman wrote some articles where he argues that life is a system which is always balancing between chaotic dynamic and non-chaotic dynamic. Today, many conservation biologists use the tools of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">graph theory<\/a> (network analysis) in order to get a better understanding of how things are influenced by a minor change.<\/p>\n\n<p>But defending an endangered species like the pandas or elephants is certainly much more a matter of ethics than of human security faced with environmental shifts.

However, I do think that there are some general trends that can give us some intuition, and make the campaign to protect certain species more than just an ethical issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biodiversity (i.e. having a wide range of different organisms (and genetically diverse organisms)) has a number of potential benefits (for references see the work of <a href=\"http://www.cbs.umn.edu/explore/departments/eeb/faculty-research/directory/g-david-tilman\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Tilman<\/a>, among others):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Improved resilience to catastrophic events.<\/li>\n<li>Improved temporal stability of populations within an ecosystem (which kind of dovetails with (1))<\/li>\n<li>Improved ecosystem productivity (this has mostly been studied in terms of the amount of biomass grown by plants in an ecosystem, but may generalize to other kinds of ecosystem functioning)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Ecosystem services are effects that various ecosystems have on the world that makes it more hospitable to humans. While some may be, as Remi.b suggested, overhyped, some are very real, such as bioremediation (the removal of compounds toxic to humans from the air and water), the continued presence of pollinators and nutrient-rich soil in which to grow crops, and carbon sequestration. Given that the continuation of these ecosystem services is necessary for our long-term survival as a species, it is in our interest to ensure that ecosystems remain intact to provide them. Increasing resilience and temporal stability of ecosystems reduces the chance that we will lose ecosystems and the services they provide. Increasing the productivity of an ecosystem in many cases increases the extent to which it can perform that service (this is most obvious in the case of carbon sequestration). (NOTE: I'm phrasing this all in terms of human survival because I think that's the most clear cut argument. I think there are other arguments, but they're murkier)<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this raises the question of how much of an impact the loss of a single species (such as a tiger) is likely to have on the benefits associated with biodiversity. There are a few hypotheses here, but in any specific case the impacts will be fairly dependent on the role of the extinct species in the ecosystem. The loss of some species (keystone species) will have a disproportionate impact on the rest of the environment. While it is hard to predict which species will turn out to be keystone species until it is too late, apex predators (like tigers) are more likely than average to be keystone species, or to have an important but not disproportionate role in the ecosystem. This makes sense, because such predators are fairly often the only species at their trophic level in an ecosystem, and having more trophic levels dramatically increases the biodiversity possible in an ecosystem. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even if there isn't reason to think that a certain species is relatively important to an environment, there can sometimes be benefit in trying to save it via what's called \"the umbrella effect.\" This boils down to the idea that saving one species generally involves saving the rest of the ecosystem that it lives in. So sometimes, from a funding perspective, it makes the most sense to choose the most charismatic species from a given ecosystem and attempt to get public investment in saving that species. An attempt to save this species can then result in preserving a great deal of biodiversity in the rest of the ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, ultimately, no, we cannot know how important a given organism is to an ecosystem or to human well-being.

The first is the olfactory system. This system allows us to recognize what a smell is. You can tell the difference between gardenias and grass because of your olfactory system. The second system is the trigeminal system. This system tells you whether an odor is irritating or pleasing. It gets its name from the trigeminal nerve--the nerve that gives feeling to your entire face. Your sense of smell is all tangled up with the trigeminal nerve, meaning that some odors are painful to smell and some are not. When you smell ammonia and it stings your nose, that is the trigeminal system at work. The third is the vomeronasal system. It's thought to be use for detecting pheromones. However, it isn't important to this explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>So. What is meant by a \"pure\" odorant? It means that it <em>only<\/em> smells. It doesn't create a reaction in the trigeminal system. It only activates the olfactory system. Those who have lost their sense of smell are still able to distinguish many smells because of the reaction by the trigeminal system. One study I've read tested 47 different smells for people who have lost function in their olfactory system. Out of those 47, 45 of them were identified by the people with no sense of smell. The two that were not identified (decanoic acid and vanillin) didn't stimulate the trigeminal system and are thus considered to be \"pure\" odorants. In other words, pure odorants are odors that only smell and don't feel like anything. There are very few \"pure\" odorants, and peanut butter is one of them. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, when someone says Alzheimer's changes the ability to smell, they have to make sure they're <em>only<\/em> testing smell and not touch too. That's why they need to use a \"pure\" odorant. Otherwise, the Alzheimer's patient might still be able to identify the scent and the test would be useless. <\/p>\n","answer_id":13762,"question_id":10841,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10841/what-is-a-pure-odorant","last_activity_date":1386017139,"creation_date":1381666398,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is a \"pure odorant\"?","body":"<p>This article about <a href=\"http://news.ufl.edu/2013/10/08/alzheimers-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\">testing for Alzheimer's<\/a>, via changes in the ability to smell, said:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She thought of peanut butter because, she said, it is a \u201cpure odorant\u201d\n  that is only detected by the olfactory nerve and is easy to access.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not clear on what that means.

There's definitely more than one way to define them, but hopefully this will give you some idea.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Broadly, biological circuits are reminiscent of electrical circuits in that energy or information flows through the cell.  In biological pathways (a more typical terminology), genes in the cell (usually proteins) will use a signal (usually in the form of a chemical compound or a modification of a protein, but sometimes a simple ion or even electrical current (rarely)).  The signal then can be transmuted into a different chemical compound or it can even alter a protein so that it functions differently.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of classic examples.  The first is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citric acid cycle<\/a> (also called the Krebs cycle), discovered in the 1930s.  Here you can see that Citrate is chemically transformed into acetate and carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of NADH (reduced nicotinic acid dinucleotide).  Each step of the cycle has a different compound which is handled by a different protein enzyme.  While all the proteins and compounds may coexist in the same part of the cell, there is nonetheless an orderly circuit of chemical energy mediated by the genes of the cell and controlled by the cell as it adjusts the amount of enzymes available for each step of the cycle.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0cj7k.png\" alt=\"citric acid cycle\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Another example of an entirely different sort of gene pathway works differently but has the same set of concepts.  Mitogen Activated Kinases (MAPKs) are proteins which have generally two states an activated state and an inactivated one.  As you can see below, an outside signal like high salt osmolarity or a signalling molecule is sensed by a receptor on the cell surface.  By some method a MAP Kinase is activated, perhaps by the addition of a phosphate to the surface of the protein or by dimerizing the MAPK.  Once activated, the MAPK will then phoshphorylate another kinase, which may activate yet another.  Finally a protein in the nucleus will be activated and cause transcription of some target genes. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h6h9T.png\" alt=\"MAP KINSE SIGNALLING PATHWAY \"><\/p>\n\n<p>In the latter case, a very small change to the protein costs little energy and information is being transmitted, but by biochemical signals where proteins are modified and affect other proteins.  That's a more subtle circuit than in the former case where relatively many individual molecules might be processed by enzymes together.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This hopefully gives you some idea of what a biological circuit looks like.  There are many other examples and subtle variations but that's a quick tour. <\/p>\n\n<p>Experiments involving these pathways are too numerous to mention - individual proteins may be modified, their concentration within the cell can be altered by say mutations in the chromosome, pathway intermediate compounds like Succinate might be added to see how the citric acid cycle responds, isotopic labeled compounds can be added to see where they go in the cell.  There's nearly 100 years of experiments here.  that's a lot. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this will just give you some idea of where to start.  Nearly any biochemistry textbook covers these topics in better detail, but then they are often over 1000 pages long!  <\/p>\n","answer_id":10564,"question_id":10548,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c8eaa464f937625339f9f5e70bdbb57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":5066,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5066/gent","reputation":9,"display_name":"Gent"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1386016274,"creation_date":1386016274,"body":"<p>A genetic circuit can be likened to electrical circuits, except rather than switches, resistors, wires, <em>etc.<\/em>, you use promoters, ribosomal binding sites, coding sequences, repressors, <em>etc.<\/em> - This will get you well acquainted with the new jargon around bioengineering: <a href=\"http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":13761,"question_id":10548,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10548/gene-circuits-experiments","last_activity_date":1386016274,"creation_date":1379975987,"answer_count":2,"title":"Gene Circuits; experiments","body":"<p>First, my background - I'm a newcomer to biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is a gene circuit, and how might I simulate one in a laboratory?

Psychology in humans is already a difficult study, at times failing to demonstrate results with real scientific rigor. When studying animal psychology, you face another substantial barrier - language. Although some primates have been taught to communicate with sign language, the best of them are still far from the level of proficiency of a human. We can measure brain activity and observe behavior, which can lead us to strong suspicions about what is going on in an animal's mind, but very little can actually be proven.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mostly, all we can do is speculate about such questions. You will find some veterinarians out there who treat pets for mental conditions, but you will find at least as many people calling them quacks as those who believe in the validity of their work. And certainly, they can't prove to you that a treatment has helped an animal. It's subjective.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we see an animal do something which in a human might reliably be interpreted as a sign of depression, it's possible that this interpretation is appropriate for the animal as well. It's also possible that there is some totally foreign unrelated explanation. The problem we find when trying to scientifically discuss matters which cannot be proven scientifically is that scientists must be careful to state what they know and nothing more. So they might say \"We cannot prove that the porpoise is depressed\", or \"Science cannot prove the existence of a God.\" This is often misinterpreted as evidence against the finding - that the porpoise is not depressed; that there is no God. This is a fallacy. Rather, we should recognize that we have different ways of exploring questions like these.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can't prove it to you, but I know that my Beagle had a rich emotional life. I know this because I spent huge amounts of time with him. He was a close friend of mine. I would just as soon question whether my wife has real emotions as my dog. I can't prove that my wife's emotions are real either, but I don't have to. It would be silly to assume that everything she shares with me is some sort of evolutionary programming, and not real emotion.

There are, however, some technical issues and obviously many ethical ones.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer specifically to your questions<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it even theoretically possible to alter human genetics using only an injected substance? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes it is. Aside from the good example of radioactive substances given by Alexander, another good one (and probably one that is more common) is that of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen\">chemical mutagens<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to understand that the mutation caused by these substances are random, or only partially selective.\nFor instance, certain substances, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_%28chemistry%29\">intercalating agents<\/a> can interpose themselves in between the bases of the DNA, interfering and possibly giving rise to mutations during DNA replication.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other substances such as alkilating agents are a bit more specific, although still not gene- or locus- specific.\nFor instance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylnitrosourea\">ethylnitrosourea<\/a> (ENU) favours A->T base transversions and AT->GC transitions.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'd imagine trying to get a single DNA change to propogate through the entire body without being killed off by the immune system would be near impossible.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The immune system would not necessarily kill cells with mutations. Think of what happens during cancer developement.\nAlso, an extremely important point: mutating a somatic cell (i.e. not a sperm or an egg) can induce a mutant phenotype in the individual but it will not be transmitted to his/her progeny.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since we are aware of genetic markers that are related to predispositions to certain medical conditions (e.g. heart problems, cancers, high blood pressure, strokes, etc), is it possible to modify human DNA to create these issues in a living person?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As Alexander says, there is much research in this field.\nSome attempts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy\">gene therapy<\/a> have indeed been made, and some have a big potential. We are, however, still far away for gene therapy to become a routine treatment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, remember that:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>not all diseases are genetic diseases<\/li>\n<li>not all genetic diseases are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenic_disorder#Single_gene_disorder\">monogenic<\/a>: some derive from a complex interplay of different factors and hence curing them is not as simple as providing the correct version of the mutated gene.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Has much research gone into how genetics affects thought and opinion, or the way we perceive and react to situations at an emotional level? If so, is it theoretically possible to alter this at a biological level?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but I would say that we are very very far away from a complete understanding of how thought and emotions are coded in our brain. The very difficult point is that one needs to study these events at multiple scales. We can study a big region of the brain and say that it is involved in fear coding, for instance. But then if you want to go deeper and study what happens at the single cell level you need to look at a lot of different cells to see how they interact between each other.\nFrom the other side of the \"size scale\", it is possible to study biochemical processes in the single neuron, but then again it is difficult to study how these processes are integrated in big networks of cells, especially <em>in vivo<\/em>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1776,"question_id":1773,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1773/altering-the-human-genome","last_activity_date":1385948855,"creation_date":1334239659,"answer_count":2,"title":"Altering the human genome","body":"<p>I recently had a conversation with a rather <em>unusual<\/em> gentleman who was, let's say, more than a little partial to conspiracy theories.

The ability to image lacZ expression in living transgenic animals would further extend the use of this reporter. It has been reported that 7-hydroxy-9H-(1,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one)-beta-d-galactopyranoside (DDAOG), a conjugate of beta-galactose and 7-hydroxy-9H-(1,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one), is not only a chromogenic lacZ substrate but that the cleavage product has far-red fluorescence properties detectable by in vivo imaging. In an attempt to noninvasively image lacZ expression in vivo, we applied fluorescence imaging to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPR56), knockout (KO) mouse model, in which the lacZ gene is introduced in the GPR56 locus. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, GPR56KO/LacZ mice showed three- to fourfold higher fluorescence intensity in the head area 5 min after tail-vein injection of DDAOG. beta-Gal staining in sections of whole brain showed strong lacZ expression in homozygotes, but not in WT mice, consistent with lacZ activity detected by in vivo imaging. The kidneys were also visualized with fluorescence imaging both in vivo and ex vivo, consistent with beta-gal staining findings. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence imaging can be used for in vivo real-time detection of lacZ activity by fluorescence imaging in lacZ transgenic mice.

In general, your experimental approach is feasible, however, the devil is in the details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, your biggest challenge will be to gain access to suitable optics. Imaging individual eukaryotic cells is relatively easy with any diffraction-limited optical microscope, because their scale is usually 10-20 $\\mu$m. Bacteria are a much smaller cell size, and they (mostly) cannot be imaged using diffraction-limited techniques on a single cell level. To image a single cell requires super-resolution optics/techniques.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it sounds like you're doing diauxic shift curves. It may not be necessary to image at a single cell level, and you may be able to get away with making good measurements of cells in aggregate using any camera-equipped microscope, or even an optical plate reader since you mentioned $\\beta$-gal.<\/p>\n\n<p>@Alan Boyd pointed out a chemiluminescent substrate for $\\beta$-gal which could work well if you have access to an optical imager that can give you readouts of photon counts/second. This would give you readings of average enzymatic activity (which you can correlate to expression level).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, you describe having cells be bright/dark depending on the utilized substrate and that would be harder to achieve. There are many ways I envision to do this, but they all take some amount of genetic manipulation. Perhaps the easiest thing to do might be to make an expression plasmid that places LacZ under control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. These plasmids are very common and would give you an easy entry to image lactose usage.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13719,"question_id":13700,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f8a4da7480c620ebaa9ed7c31fb227b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4840,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4840/a-kennard","reputation":1429,"display_name":"A.

NB, this is an Invitrogen/Life Technologies website, so all the reagents they mention are ones sold by the company; there may be others not mentioned here. Of these, DDAOG is very stable, which would allow for measuring the initiation of $\\beta$-gal activity, but might not work to measure decreases in $\\beta$-gal activity (without bleaching the dye). Resorufin Galactoside is sensitive and stable at physiological pH, allowing measurement over a long period of time.

MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY 311: 241-247   DOI: 10.1007/s11010-007-9690-4 <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Abstract: Ultrastructural alteration and hydrogen peroxide localization were examined in Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli during rifampicin effect using transmission electron microscopy. Bacterial cells were treated with rifampicin and then were examined by electron microscopy to observe the changes of ultrastructure or hydrogen peroxide accumulation in living cells that took place before lysis. Intriguingly, rifampicin treatment led to presence of an additional location of hydrogen peroxide accumulation within the cells. There was an association between the frequency and size of the additional location of hydrogen peroxide accumulation and the concentration of rifampicin. Furthermore, an additional ultrastructure, mesosomes, was also present in cells during rifampicin effect. The frequency and size of mesosome increased with the increasing concentration of rifampicin. Result of multiple linear regression showed that the size of mesosome plays as a key factor in the quantity of excess hydrogen peroxide accumulation in cells during rifampicin effect. Linear correlation was confirmed between quantity of excess hydrogen peroxide accumulation and the size of mesosome in cells during rifampicin effect. This finding intensely indicated that mesosomes are just the additional location of hydrogen peroxide accumulation in cells under cellular injury caused by rifampicin treatment. The mesosome formation is always accompanied by excess hydrogen peroxide accumulation in X. campestris pv. phaseoli during rifampicin effect.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This paper has been cited 7 times.

This review is a polemic in favour of the idea that prokaryotes do indeed contain intracellular membrane-bounded compartments. It has no abstract, but the first paragraph gives a flavour of its stance:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The traditional view of life on Earth divides the living world into two major groups, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These two groups were originally suggested to differ in very basic respects. While eukaryotes had complex cell structures including a cytoskeleton and intracellular membrane-bounded organelles, prokaryotes were believed to lack them. In fact, numerous textbooks and current sources still note this distinction and hold it to be true. For example, in Campbell\u2019s Biology [Campbell, 1993, p. 515] it is stated without equivocation: \u2018Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-enclosed organelles.\u2019 In \u2018Functional Anatomy of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells\u2019 [Tortora et al., 2009, chapt. 4] it is similarly claimed that \u2018Prokaryotes lack membrane-enclosed organelles, specialized structures that carry on various activities\u2019. In the current Wikipedia, under \u2018Prokaryote\u2019 the following statement can be found: \u2018The prokaryotes are a group of organisms whose cells lack a cell nucleus (karyon) or any other membrane-bounded organelles\u2019. In the same online compendium under \u2018Organelle\u2019, one can read: \u2018whilst prokaryotes do not possess organelles per se, some do contain protein-based microcompartments\u2019. Proteinceous microcompartments will be the subject of a forthcoming Journal of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology written symposium, but this one will show that these generalizations, suggesting a lack of subcellular compartmentalization in prokaryotes, are blatantly in error [Murat et al., 2010a].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":13709,"question_id":13707,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13707/mesosome-does-it-exist","last_activity_date":1385723330,"creation_date":1385719157,"answer_count":1,"title":"Mesosome - does it exist?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">This<\/a> wikipedia page says that mesosomes are artifacts produced by chemical fixing techniques.

The Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences 41: 161-73.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Abstract<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The goal of this study was to examine heart transplant recipients' psychological adaptation to another person's heart, with particular emphasis on recipients' attitudes toward graft and donor.\n  Thirty-five male heart recipients were examined by: the Symptom Distress Checklist (revised) (SCL-90-R); the Depression Adjective Checklist (DACL); a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (PTSD-Q); a Heart Image Questionnaire (HIQ); and a Semi-Structured Interview (SSI), aimed at eliciting attitudes and fantasies regarding the transplanted heart.\n  All instruments indicated high levels of stress even several years after the transplant, but, simultaneously, 73% of recipients felt that acquiring a new heart had had a dramatic influence on their lives with a new appreciation of the preciousness of life and a shift of priorities, toward altruism and spirituality. Sixty percent returned to work after the transplant but some had to adapt to a changed attitude from those around them who regarded them as anything from mystical creatures to vulnerable or still-sick individuals. <strong><em>While all recipients possessed a scientific knowledge of the anatomy and physiological significance of the heart (as revealed in the HIQ), many endorsed fantasies and displayed magical thinking: 46% of the recipients had fantasies about the donor's physical vigor and prowess, 40% expressed some guilt regarding the death of the donor, 34% entertained the possibility of acquiring qualities of the donor via the new heart.<\/em><\/strong> When asked to choose a most and least preferred imagined donor, 49% constructed their choices according to prejudices, desires, or fears related to ethnic, racial or sexual traits attributed to the donor.\n  This study confirms the intuitive idea that heart transplant involves a stressful course of events that produces an amplified sense of the precariousness of existence. Simultaneously, it gives rise to rejoicing at having been granted a new lease on life and a clear sense of new priorities, especially with regard to relationships. Less expectedly, this study shows that, despite sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and physiology, almost half the heart recipients had an overt or covert notion of potentially acquiring some of the donor's personality characteristics along with the heart. The concomitance of the magical and the logical is not uncommon in many areas of human existence, and is probably enhanced by the symbolic nature of the heart, and maybe, also, by the persistent stress that requires an ongoing, emotionally intense, adaptation process.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Another study is reported in:<\/p>\n\n<p>Bunzel B, <em>et al<\/em>.

You should read both papers very carefully, I highlighted the most important facts but this is a very tricky question, esp. when it comes to defining what mental activitiy is. The papers also give an explanation of how fMRI signal is linked to NEURONAL activity, as far as I remember there is no strong direct link.<\/p>\n\n<p>You assume in your question that a mathematician solving a differential equation needs higher mental activity than a child reading a book. Is this legitimate? It seems intuitive but also very subjective. <strong>In the paper they mention that for the highest and lowest energy consumption we lose consciousness.<\/strong> I will not draw conclusions from this. However, you are talking about conscious mental activities so this may answer your question. To me it means more that the understanding of the human brain in neurobiololgy is on the level of the Rutherford Atomic Model in Physics at the beginning of the 20th century. We have not really got a clue how information is processed and how it's constrained by physical laws and principles of entropy and energy. By reading the 2 papers it looks more like the human brain is not raising energy consumption as a computer would (the computer analogy pretty much fails when compared to the human brain). Most of the energy is used for unconscious processes in \"standby mode\". <\/p>\n\n<p>As in physics, extreme cases such as savants and the mentally disabled are probably the best starting point to exclude possible models of human brain and physical boundary conditions as we cannot approach the questions of human brain in a reductionistic way. How can savants like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek\">Kim Peek<\/a> process such huge amounts of information AND save it. He is able to scan books pages just once and know them by heart thereafter. His brain does not, however, consume more energy than an average human brain. So mental activity is probably not a very good term, quantity, or even really suited to be scientifically used. Does neuronal activity mean mental activity (in the sense of your definition?) Reading the papers, the problem is the separation of mental and neuronal activities. At first you have to know what are the basic brain functions and processes that are consuming most of the energy. However the brain is not built in modular way like a computer (most energy is used here for constantly refreshing RAM). So there is not really a objective way to analyse and separate this modular energy consumption, <em>if it even is modular<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, most models about information processing in human brain are intuitive guessing (again Rutherford). We need much more detailed experiments and data (Blue Brain Project). fMRi is like analysing a atom with a magnifying glass. Also, the more prosperous approach from a biophysical perspective is probably not the level of \"mental activity\" but the hard-based amount of information processed by human brains and linked energy consumption (Kim Peek). But therefore we need a model of how this information is saved in human brain. Do normal humans save the same information as Kim Peek scanning a page or are we just unable to recall it consciouscly?

Mintun<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the average adult human, the brain represents approximately 2% of\n  the total body weight but approximately 20% of the energy consumed\n  (Clark &amp; Sokoloff 1999), 10 times that predicted by its weight alone.\n  Relative to this high rate of ongoing or \u201cbasal\u201d metabolism (usually\n  measured while resting quietly awake with eyes closed), the amount\n  dedicated to task-evoked regional imaging signals is remarkably small.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The regional increases in absolute blood flow associated with imaging\n  signals as measured with PET are rarely more than 5%\u201310% of the\n  resting blood flow of the brain. These are modest modulations in\n  ongoing circulatory activity that rarely affect the overall rate of\n  brain blood flow during even the most arousing perceptual and vigorous\n  motor activity (Fox et al. 1987, Friston et al. 1990, Lennox 1931,\n  Madsen et al. 1995, Roland et al. 1987, Sokoloff et al. 1955).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[...]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>From knowledge of these relationships, one can estimate that if blood flow and glucose utilization increase by 10%, but oxygen consumption does not, the local energy consumption increase owing to a typical task-related response could be as little as 1%. It becomes clear, then, that the brain continuously expends a considerable amount of energy even in the absence of a particular task (i.e., when a subject is awake and at rest). <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Techniques like fMRI measure relatively small differences, their existence does not contradict the claim that the energy consumption of the brain doesn't change a lot between the resting state and performing an activity.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.112819\">1.

Large areas of the brain are specialized for tasks like the visual and motor cortices.  Other areas are known to be responsible for spatial memory (hippocampus) and emotional learning (amygdala).  Higher order functions like you're describing are classically assigned to the prefrontal cortex, but that means little.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because there is some level of functional specificity throughout the brain, the fMRI studies you mention generally look at many places in the brain (nearly) simultaneously.  They then compare relative activation in different areas under different conditions, and are clever about how they frame their experiments to determine which areas are associated with which responses.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most common method of measuring activity is through the BOLD response, which measures haemoglobin's oxygenation state as a proxy for the amount of blood flowing into the area under the presumption that there is high metabolic demand there.  For the purposes of this discussion, this is fairly useful since glucose delivery should be a reasonable proxy for metabolic demand even if it <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7197/full/nature06976.html\">has limitations when it comes to predicting neural activity.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So which areas are metabolically more active while doing a cognitive activity?  In <a href=\"http://sheng-lab.psych.umn.edu/pdf_files/Atherton_fMRI_chess.pdf\">this study<\/a> they test exactly that.  Their basic finding is that chess does increase mental activity in certain areas of the brain, particularly the parietal and occipital lobes in real game conditions, and that the activation was relatively bilteral between the left and right hemispheres.  I just glanced through it, but it looks like the authors were surprised that the activation was less pre-frontal and more visuospatial.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>I believe this supports the logical conclusion: thinking takes energy<\/strong>.  But your brain is used for many things, so the change in activation is best understood in a relative sense.  Watching TV also takes energy, preferentially in the visual cortex.

There is no support for it in evidence, or in theory. Nor can there be because in its own terms it defies both. It's founder seems to have thought himself a genius, and solicited a cult-like following determined to spread his message, as their own. He had no college-level science education - see facts and citations below (*).<\/p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind the \"theorist's\" target audience when he wrote Food of the Gods. Not scientists nor anyone scientifically literate. In his own words: \"[The target audience is] the 18-25 year old group that is drug-friendly but has no rationale except that it's a good time\" (Gracie, Zarkov &amp; McKenna interview). <\/p>\n\n<p>As for his understanding of evolution, the scope of his grasp, here's what he thought science says - if you believe what he says. No harm to have smelling salts in easy reach if you're minimally educated in biology, i.e. high school level:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Conventional evolutionary theory tells us that small adaptive changes eventually become genetically scripted into the species\" (OMNI interview)<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's 180 degrees backward from true or accurate, a recitation of what Lamarck thought - over 200 years ago, and before anyone ever heard of Darwin, or natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's nothing theoretical in the \"stoned apes\" storyline, despite its claim. It's not a theory, its malarkey of the same type as Creationism - but from the opposite fringe: new age psychedelia, not old time religion.<\/p>\n\n<p>(rolls eyeballs) <\/p>\n\n<p>*TM was at quite a disadvantage for science ed. For any major in college, even liberal arts - there's normally a 'general studies' science requirement. Its a minimal basic in higher ed, across the board. But TM's college program (Tussman Experimental) is one that specifically, uniquely excluded science. And short-lived as it was, the college was roundly criticized in its day on that very point. Its founder made excuses, e.g. this quote (from Tussman's book EXPERIMENT AT BERKELEY): <\/p>\n\n<p>\"It is recognized that the program does nothing in the way of integrating science with the social sciences and humanities. We leave this two-culture problem for wiser men to solve. In this respect, however, our students are either better OR WORSE OFF than others\" (caps added for emphasis). <\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously lame? Colleagues in education didn't buy it. For example, this remark from Sidney Rosen (Univ of Illinois): \"By his admission that he cannot find a way of integrating scientific ideas into a basic two-year program, Mr. Tussman is guilty of contradicting the educational goals he defends ... It is difficult for me to see how the curriculum can flourish without science as an integral part.\" - Journal of Research in Science Teaching 7: 271 (1970)<\/p>\n\n<p>Prescient? The college didn't flourish, it floundered. It was already crashing when Rosen wrote that. In fact, the 'experiment' seems to have perhaps been a case of politics in education, masquerading as 'educational reform.' TM himself offers an interesting remark along just such lines: <\/p>\n\n<p>\"... it was an experimental program... this thing called the Tussman Experimental College. I arrived at Berkeley the year after the Free Speech Movement ... in an effort to keep the place from blowing sky high they had told this left-wing professor that he could have an experimental section of the university\" (www.tripzine.com/listing.php?id=terence1)<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the kind of info those who think they're all into McKenna, all about his rap and 'ideas' - have no clue.

In this paper, the authors must have established 10 separate experimental lines that then evolved in different carbon dioxide levels. For example, 10 separate aliquots of algae are drawn from the same source population and then separately subjected to the agent of selection. These replicate lines should remain separate and not be mixed or crossed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Replicate lines are useful in experimental evolution for a few reasons. Because you are studying a population that is experiencing a selection pressure, you expect that genetic changes are in response to that pressure. However, changes can also occur due to drift. Replicate lines (and a consistent response to selection among them) is important to ensure that changes are a response to selection rather than to some other force (drift, mutation). Some drift is bound to happen when the lines are founded, because you are selecting a subset of the population, which is actually a good thing. Each line gets a random subset of genes which then evolve together. This potentially allows discovery of different genetic pathways to the same adaptive response.<\/p>\n\n<p>The background and lots of examples are in Garland and Rose, <em><a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520261808\" rel=\"nofollow\">Experimental Evolution<\/a><\/em> (UC Press, 2009). <\/p>\n","answer_id":13653,"question_id":13643,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13643/whats-a-replicate-line","last_activity_date":1385395711,"creation_date":1385307719,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's a replicate line?","body":"<p>The methods section inside a paper I'm reading make mention of <strong>replicate lines<\/strong>.<br>\nExample: \"We founded 10 replicate lines from a single clone\".

The way that the carbon budget stays balanced was a bit of a mystery until recently. The amount of carbon in the atmosphere (and the rate at which it was increasing) was lower than models suggested that it should be, given rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and other carbon releasing processes. Somewhere, there was a \"missing carbon sink\" that wasn't being accounted for. After many years of debating whether the sink was terrestrial or aquatic, it turned out to be a little of both (which is the conclusion to just about every debate in ecology), although somewhat skewed towards the terrestrial (I think). <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/climate/2007/0708/full/climate.2007.35.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forests<\/a> were sequestering more carbon than had been thought, and so were oceans to some extent (although ocean sequestration relied on a chemical reaction that is in danger of reversing if the water warms up too much). For a thorough account, see this <a href=\"http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/missing-carbon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But it sounded like you weren't wondering what the missing sink was so much as how there continues to be enough carbon in the air for plants to photosynthesize (if I'm interpreting your question correctly). Carbon gets back into the air for the most part because of cellular respiration, which all organisms, including plants, do. Net primary productivity takes plant cellular respiration into account, but there are still tons of living things on earth eating plants (and thus taking in their carbon) and then breathing it back out after they break down the carbon-containing molecules for energy. There is also natural combustion and volcanoes and such putting carbon back into the air.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong> (to address the new part of your question): Oil and coal were produced when large quantities of carbon were buried deep under ground (and thus subjected to lots of pressure) for thousands of years. This is suspected to have happened during the aptly name Carboniferous era, which featured giant plants and, scientists hypothesize, no decomposers to break them down. Since we have much decomposers now, and much smaller plants, oil and carbon are not currently being produced. This is why we call them non-renewable resources. By extracting them from the ground and burning them, we are taken carbon that had effectively been removed from the pool of actively cycling carbon and adding it back in. <\/p>\n\n<p>The carbon cycle doesn't really have input or output (except the occasional carbon exchange with outer space), because it is defined as already including standing sinks like oil and coal. When we take carbon out of a sink, like oil or coal, it needs to go somewhere else. Terrestrial and aquatic sinks can store some of the additional carbon that we're adding to the not-underground part of the cycle. However, they can't store all of it, so some is staying in the atmosphere instead.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13630,"question_id":13600,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1385232384}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13600/where-does-all-the-carbon-go","last_activity_date":1385232384,"creation_date":1385035862,"answer_count":1,"title":"Where does all the carbon go?","body":"<p>I found it hard to get numbers on global primary production, but apparently it's somewhere around 50-60 $Gt / year$ for carbon content in the terrestrial production, and a similar figure for the oceans.

Ideally, grad school is where you do research on your own terms, and what lab you join is the single most important consideration. What you want is a competent program that:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>gives you the flexibility to create your own subfield<\/li>\n<li>has supportive and knowledgeable faculty that you can work under<\/li>\n<li>has excellent computer science AND marine biology programs (or analogs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>First, find faculty who are doing research you are interested in, and look at the programs available at their schools. Since they're the most important consideration, everything else will fall into place after that. <\/p>\n\n<p>Next, email 5 of those professors with an introduction of what you're interested in, particularly about their research.  Ask them what programs are most appropriate at their university, and how flexible you can be in taking appropriate coursework. <\/p>\n\n<p>At some point, you'll probably want to decide if you want to be more of a marine biologist or a computer scientist. Your diploma at the end of the decade is only going to say one of those things.  That shouldn't make a huge difference as to your job outlook, but is worth thinking about.  Practically, the question is whether you want to get your hands dirty, go out on a boat, and collect your own data.  Alternatively, if you join a CS program, you are more likely to be analyzing large datasets collected by other scientists. <\/p>\n\n<p>At <em>most<\/em> universities, you'll likely only have the option to join a biology program. But there are certainly excellent CS programs with biology oriented faculty.  Even then, the CS faculty is more likely to be doing genomics and such.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For practical recommendations, the University of Washington in Seattle would probably have something appropriate to your interests. While I was there, my lab was adjacent to an Oceanography lab that had a video wall for visualizing ocean currents and such. Not precisely marine biology, but UW has a very collaborative faculty and I'm sure the two departments work together.  <\/p>\n\n<p>UW also has a strong computational biology program that you can go into either through CS or through one of the many biology programs. You should also check out the Institute for Systems Biology at UW. I saw a presentation there specifically about DNA exchange between marine microorganisms.  I'm not saying UW is your best option, I just know that school because I did my PhD there. <\/p>\n\n<p>A final word of advice. Once you're in a program, it's very likely your interests will change as you learn about other research going on. And also, it's quite possible you won't get into the lab you want simply because of money or logistics. With both of these in mind, be flexible about where you're willing to go. What you do during your PhD isn't really that important anyway.  If you're going to be research scientist, it's what you do during your Postdoc that will establish your career. Just take the opportunity to learn everything you can and see what's out there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.

Many people (including me) believe that this intersection is about to be a really important field - ecologists are starting to recognize the need for scientists with these skills, but there is not yet a lot of infrastructure in place to train such scientists. This presents a challenge to people like you and me right now. On the other hand, it means that if we can find a way to acquire these skills, we should be pretty well set up to help establish this field (bonus: we should be pretty well set up to get jobs).<\/p>\n\n<p>I am personally of the opinion that if your interests are truly interdisciplinary, it's a really good idea to go somewhere that has a framework in place to support interdisciplinary work. Otherwise, you can end up in a situation where your adviser doesn't feel equipped to offer guidance on large portions of your projects, which can strain your working relationship and stymie your progress. Despite the lip service paid to the importance of interdisciplinary research, however, programs that are set up to provide interdisciplinary mentoring can be hard to find. The best course of action depends very specifically on how you want to combine these fields.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to stay rooted in biology and use computer science and math as tools without doing research that furthers them as fields, you're in luck. There are a lot of labs with PIs who do this kind of research and many more who are interested in finding people who can, as terdon said, \"do their modeling.\" I would be careful of the latter scenario while you're still in the learning phase of your career, however. As a student, your goal should be to learn how to best do the research that you want to. If you are the lone modeler/math person in a group, you may be in high demand but your rate of learning will probably be a lot slower than if you had an adviser who was actually doing what you are interested in. If these are your interests, your options are pretty varied but take a look at UC Berkley, and UC Davis. Also UW, as Alexander suggested. There are indeed good collaborations between biology and computer science there. I found it helpful to search for people who were studying macroecology, but that might be a label that is used more for terrestrial systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you want to do research that actually furthers computer science in addition to biology, things get more complicated (I don't know if there are people who do both math research and biology research so I can't speak to that). Don't constrain your thinking by believing that you have to get a degree in one or the other; dual degree programs exist (and that may sound intimidating, but they aren't necessarily more work, just different work), although they are so few and far between that you might decide that it makes the most sense to just choose one field. If this is what you want to do, take a look at UC Santa Barbara - they do a ton of marine bio research and are home to the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. Also, again, UW. I'd recommend my program too, but it's neither marine nor tropical.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, if you want to get a feel for how open a lab is to you doing interdisciplinary research, I found that it was best to just ask explicitly. If a place offered joint appointments (i.e. the ability for me to be co-advised by professors in two departments), dual degrees, or even just had research groups that involved people from multiple departments, I took that as a great sign.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, don't start out with low expectations for finding a match for your interests.

For such question it is important to very well define the concepts you're using. For example, the concept of species is not well defined (and will certainly never be well defined as it does not represent a natural category to my point of view). Also, the separation you do between complex and non-complex species might not be obvious. For example, you create two categories which are bacteria/virus and multicellular. But you kind of forget the many of the eukaryotes which belong to non of these two categories. Or some bacteria that might almost be considered as multicellular.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think it would help answering your question if we had the arguments of Sir Arthur Clark for saying such things. Below are two arguments I could use to defend your statement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speciation:<\/p>\n\n<p>If you consider than one population rarely (or virtually never) go under sufficiently major changes before undergoing speciation, then you would never have only one species which is very different from the others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ecology:<\/p>\n\n<p>One might consider that one species cannot by itself be responsible of a whole cycle of elements. Therefore, if the species we observe can theoretically live forever (equilibrium), then, it implies that other species must exist to recycle their wastes. But this hypothesis has nothing to do with the separation of species per complexity that you do.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update:<\/p>\n\n<p>Following your comment: So what you had in mind seem roughly the same than my \"Ecology\" argument. The difference is that I emphasized on the fact that one species alone cannot live for ever because they degrade their resources through time. I did not want to say that one individual of one species cannot live without the presence of another individual of another species. This individual would need the presence of the other species not for himself but rather but its great-great-grand-children when one resource would have been totally consumed by the ancestors.<\/p>\n\n<p>For your curiosity, here is base of the tree of life. What is eukarotic but not plants, animals or fungi are called <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protistes\" rel=\"nofollow\">protista<\/a> and are all (or almost all?!) unicellular.

Its hard to draw a trend from a single example.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a little survey of the one's I've heard. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We are intelligent because we have opposable thumbs and can use tools, which evolved our brains.  This is an old one - maybe as old as Darwin's time.  I think its mostly ignored now because so many animals - including pandas and other non primates have opposable thumbs or use tools or both.  (monkeys and chimps use tools, and recently crows have also been observed to use tools.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>brain size.  We do have a large brain to body size ratio.  There are other animals with similar ratios and they don't have internets.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>We are 'self-aware'.  That is to say we recognize ourselves as an individual.  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/32/5/329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">It was proven that other primates can recognize themselves<\/a> in mirrors (putting a red dot on their forehead. when they see their reflection, they touch their own forehead).  So that's not exclusive either.  its not a bad idea, but so far it doesn't seem to make the <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>'We ate something' I once read a discussion of <a href=\"https://www.greenpassion.org/index.php?/topic/20997-humans-primates-psychedelics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">how humans might have ingested psychotropic plants or fungi<\/a>.  As you can see, this was 2010.  Its not the worst idea, but its hard to prove.  Lots of experiments on cats since the '60s have not produced cat's who care to tell us if they are intelligent.  Maybe they are just too smart in the first place.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These theories, from when I was a student are so discounted now, you can't find too much record of anymore since they were pre-internet and also they seem so unlikely now.  <\/p>\n\n<p>More modern theories have locked onto <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Models\" rel=\"nofollow\">social configurations of human societies which drive intelligent adaptations<\/a>.  This is stemming from observations that human evolution (the rate at which genetic variants are retained in the gene pool) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2410101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">are accelerating since humans have become social<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>These new theories while standing on some amazing evidence are still feeling around in the dark - stuff about how social interactions have created a preference for intelligence-like traits. There is probably something to that - once intelligence gets a toehold it is a clear advantage.  But how did it show up only once and why us?

The two distributions might also be controlled by different mechanisms, so that e.g. winter distributions might be more sensitive to yearly climate. If you want to look at population differences and reasons for these I think it is therefore more useful to study seasonal distributions separately. An exploratory analysis could be to compare distribution percentiles (north/south and east/west coordinates) to look at range edges, or to use a fixed number of edge observations to establish borders. The weighted centre-point of population distributions can be used to look for differences in overall position.

If you want to look at changes over time (even if this doesn't seem to be your main point) you should also check out dynamic occupancy models that use occurrence records to model species distribution while taking detectability into account, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-0141.1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"MacKenzie et al. 2009.

It proposes that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutations<\/a> randomly occur within the DNA, this causes changes in the phenotype (e.g. allowing digestion of a common food source), these changes can be good or bad (beneficial or deleterious). As a result, those with \"good\" mutations achieve more reproductions (the fitness of those mutant allele carriers is higher) and those mutations spread through the population. You can not direct the evolution of your DNA because <strong>mutation is random<\/strong>, even if we artificially induce mutations, <strong>we can not direct what the mutation does to the phenotype<\/strong> (though we can sometimes induce specific mutations known to have certain phenotypic effects). Selection favours some phenotypes over others but can only work with the mutations it is presented with - it can not direct the evolution of animals with wheels if mutations that allow wheels to form do not occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>From this sequence you can see the evolution of a phenotype is best explained in a most parsimonious way without the inclusion of divine intervention. It is the principles of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Occam's Razor<\/a>. <strong>Calling divine intervention in to this theory would add further, and unwarranted, complication to the model<\/strong> and we would then have to find strong evidence for the existence of a divine being, something which is still yet to happen in the eyes of most evolutionary biologists. Strong evidence has been found which suits the theory without divine intervention (including unnecessary and untestable components to a theory goes against the basic principles of science).<\/p>\n\n<p>Selection itself, though largely involved in evolution, is not necessary for traits to evolve. The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16120807\" rel=\"nofollow\">neutral theory<\/a> proposed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoo_Kimura\" rel=\"nofollow\">Motoo Kimura<\/a> and developed in the last few decades suggests that traits can evolve with out selection, via genetic drift. This means traits develop in populations purely due to random sampling of neutral (or near neutral) random alleles. The relative importance of Selectionist vs Neutralist theories remains hotly debated within evolutionary biology.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Explaining your imaginary scenario with a current theory of evolution: A new digestive enzyme<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The scene:<\/strong> There is a population of 100 deer. 50 males and 50 females. There is a potential for variance in mating success and that mating success is defined solely by the strength of the male. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Selection affects a trait:<\/strong> Males that digest their food better grow bigger and stronger. Thus selection favours males that get the most out of their food. If the ability to digest is completely genetically determined by a single locus (for simplification lets say it is) and there is only one allelic variant (one version of the gene) in our first generation then mating success will be equal among the males. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A mutant arises:<\/strong> In the next generation a single male carries a mutation in that locus. It is a mutated version of the gene which makes a key digestive enzyme work more efficiently. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Selection acts:<\/strong> This male is 10% larger and stronger than other males, and therefore sires more offspring in the next generation than any other male. These next generation offspring (technically half if it was a single mutation in a diploid organism - the other half have the ancestral haplotype) have the mutant allele. Then those males with the mutant allele also get more of the matings and so on and so on. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The allele is then spreading through the population.<\/strong> It will continue until all members of the population have the same allele (fixation) or will start over if a new allele arises which is even better. That's all evolution is, no divine beings necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What if the allele was neutral?<\/strong> If the gene for a digestive enzyme existed but was not necessary in an organisms diet it would not know it could go out and use that food source. It may not even be able to. For example, a single fruitfly carries a mutation which has no cost and allows it to digest lactose. It is unlikely to be able to utilize that allele, because dairy products are not part of it's diet and not available in the wild. The allele would only drift in the population, eventually being lost (most likely as it starts at low frequency) or becoming fixed in the population. You can see a <a href=\"http://griffinevo.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/fisher-wright-genetic-drift-simulation-for-use-in-r/\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift simulation I wrote in R here<\/a>. You can set f=1 and then play around with population size, number of generations, and replicates to get a feel for this process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note it is worth considering the effects of pleiotropy (if an allele has a good effect on one trait but a negative effect on another - including traits in different environments) and linkage (if the good allele is close to some deleterious mutations in the DNA it will struggle to spread until it is separated by recombination).<\/p>\n","answer_id":13567,"question_id":13566,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1384988899},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3241a5c229286038151f00403f4b227d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":625,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/625/joebevo","reputation":361,"display_name":"Joebevo","accept_rate":25},"score":0,"post_id":13577,"edited":false,"creation_date":1384914538,"comment_id":17617,"body":"This is a complicated topic.

Why then do scientists with a philosophical materialist outlook gloss over this?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course there is \"room\", there is room in the theory of evolution to posit that small, green, tasty but mean little pixies come and push the new food down the creature's gullets, thus teaching them to use new food sources. There is room to posit that invisible, intelligent lichen from Alpha Centauri are actually using brain waves to guide the evolutionary choices of species in a global scale. <\/p>\n\n<p>While there is clearly room to posit these theories, there is absolutely no evidence for them. The scientific community is not \"glossing over\" anything, it is just ignoring various (infinite in fact) theories for which we have absolutely no evidence in favor of those for which we have. This is a classic fallacy that was very nicely put to sleep by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russell's teapot<\/a> argument:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to\n  prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that\n  between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the\n  sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my\n  assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small\n  to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to\n  go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is\n  intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I\n  should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the\n  existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as\n  the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of\n  children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would\n  become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the\n  attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the\n  Inquisitor in an earlier time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you feel that the world you observe is best explained by assuming the existence of an omniscient god who guides the evolutionary process, then that is your right. However, the fact that you believe this to be true does not make it so any more than my believing it to be false disproves it. We are not glossing anything over when we don't take that belief seriously, no more than when we don't take Russell's teapot seriously. The Christian faith, like many others, is built on the assumption that a god exists, it will never attempt to prove or disprove that assumption because such proof would be sacrilege, the entire edifice is built on <em>faith<\/em> not evidence. If we do not share that belief, why should we attempt to fit our observations into the ideological scaffold provided by someone else's belief system? <\/p>\n\n<p>If you feel that one theory explains what you observe better than another, the onus is on you to prove it so. That is in fact the beauty of science, it is what sets it apart from most other areas of human endeavor: we change our minds when presented with compelling evidence to do so. Indeed, the history of science is littered with discarded theories. If you can come up with any decent evidence to support a theory, then that theory will (eventually) be taken seriously. Until you do, asking others to consider it based solely on the fact that you believe it to be true is hubris to say the least.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13577,"question_id":13566,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1384956307}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13566/why-is-there-such-an-argument-about-evolution","last_activity_date":1384988899,"creation_date":1384851587,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why is there such an argument about evolution?","body":"<p>DISCLAIMER: I am a Christian, although I happen to believe that some form of guided evolution via natural selection is God's mechanism for creation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now to my question, which is related to my beliefs: <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine exhibit A, an animal that is incapable of digesting a particular kind of food.

Briefly: I digested two plasmids, one with EcoRI and XmaI (p1), the other with EcoRI and AgeI (p2) [XmaI and AgeI produce compatible sticky ends], then carried out a ligation between a 1.4kb insert isolated from p2 (structure EcoRI-1.4kb-AgeI) into the 3.4kb backbone isolated from p1 (structure XmaI-20bp-BamHI-3.4kb-EcoRI). After transformation, I tested the ligation product by digest with EcoRI and BamHI, which should produce again 3.4kb + 1.4kb. The gel was poor quality but allowed the conclusion that there were different ligation products.<\/p>\n\n<p>Repeating the EcoRI/BamHI digest and gel more carefully showed there were only two variants: Variant A (8 colonies) produced the two expected bands 3.4kb and 1.4kb. Variant B (4 colonies) only produced a clear 3.4kb band, nothing else visible in the lane: in other words, it only carried either an EcoRI or a BamHI site and was in total smaller than variant A (confirmed by undigested controls). Thus, I conclude that B was simply the same 3.4kb backbone, re-ligated without the 1.4kb insert. Since the BamHI site was untouched in the backbone during the preparatory EcoRI/XmaI digestion, I assume that the EcoRI site was not recovered during the ligation of variant B.<\/p>\n\n<p>(The ligation was carried out overnight at 16 deg C, using Promega T4 DNA ligase and buffer and a molar ratio of 3:1 insert:vector at a total volume of 20uL.

The usual source of a blocking protein is defatted milk powder, i.e. casein, although some people use (or used to use) bovine serum albumin.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Secondary antibody<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In a typical blotting experiment you expose first with a <em>primary antibody<\/em> directed against the protein of interest, for example this might be an IgG raised in a rabbit. Then in a second step you add a <em>secondary antibody<\/em> which will bind to the first one - in this case this might be goat ant-rabbit IgG (i.e. anti-rabbit IgG raised in a goat). Why is this done? The secondary antibody is in the form of an antibody-enzyme conjugate, typically with horseradish peoxidase, and the final development of the blot detects the presence of the conjugated enzyme.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why use a secondary antibody? Two reasons: - firstly, there will sometimes be a degree of amplification if more than one secondary antibody molecule binds each primary antibody molecule; but more important is that it means that it is not necessary to produce an enzyme conjugated form of every primary antibody, which is time-consuming and quite tricky. So in your work you may be studying several different proteins using Westerns, but you will be able to use the same secondary antibody to detect all of them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pore size<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>That should be 0.45 - 0.5 &micro;m.

This wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolutionary approaches to depression<\/a> might be of interest as well. One sentence says: \"Feelings of regret associated with depression also cause individuals to reflect and analyze past events in order to determine why they happened and how they could have been prevented\". It basically says the same thing than you said in your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>What other advantages might \"regrets\" have? Before trying to answer it, I'd like to ask : is it necessary that it has advantages? A behavior or a feeling might as well be a by-product of selection for big brains. It might therefore not be selected for but it exists only because there is not much selection against this by-product trait.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our brain are often considered to have evolved for social purposes. I would hypothesize that if someone express \"regrets\", he might benefit from other's care and pity. And the best way to express \"regrets\" is to feel the \"regrets\". Robert Trivers would maybe say that in order to fool someone else (make someone else think we regret) the best thing to do is to fool ourself (make ourself feel \"regrets\").
