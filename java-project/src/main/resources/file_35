At the broadest scale, there are two mechanisms by which this can occur, direct benefits, and indirect benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Direct benefits<\/strong>\nThese are material things that (surprise) directly benefit the female. This might be the provision of food by the preferred male, access to a good territory or shelter that is under the control of the preferred male, protection by the preferred male, that sort of thing. Females will accordingly favour male traits that advertise potential direct benefits. These might include male size/condition/colouration, or even built structures like those of the <a href=\"http://cdn2.arkive.org/media/BA/BAB5B8BC-85EE-46AF-B8FB-EDF58DE63597/Presentation.Large/Decorated-bower-of-Vogelkop-bowerbird.jpg\">bowerbirds<\/a>. Basically, these traits show that the male knows how to look after himself, and by extension, he knows how to look after her (as males in good condition generally inhabit the best habitats and will offer the best protection and parenting).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Indirect benefits<\/strong>\nThese don't do much for the female, but they increase the genetic quality (and thus potential fitness) of her offspring. This is a much more complicated area of mate choice, and can be split into a bunch of (non-exclusive) hypotheses (below). And of course, attractive males may well offer both direct and indirect benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sensory bias:<\/em> Males may, by chance, possess a trait that holds intrinsic appeal for a female. The best explanation might be that it mimics the colour or shape of a food source (e.g. fruit) that the animal eats, and thus the animal has pre-evolved preference for that colour or shape (e.g. red patches). From that point, males with more of that trait, whatever it is, will tend to be more attractive, for no rational reason. This hypothesis is sound, but is currently lacking good empirical evidence.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Fisherian sexy sons:<\/em> This can in fact lead on from an initial sensory bias. Females may choose males that they find 'sexy', because their offspring will also be sexy, and thus be successfull in reproduction. This can lead to 'runaway' selection for sexier and sexier sons, at considerable survival cost for males. In this case, natural selection and sexual selection work in opposing directions.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Indicator mechanisms:<\/em> This is the handicap principle or 'good genes' principle. If a structure is costly to produce or maintain, or increases the risk of predation, and yet the male possessing it is still alive, he must have good genes to have withstood such a handicap. It may also advertise that the male is not infested with parasites. The extravagant plumes of birds may be largely explained by this one, but also sexy sons and sensory bias.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Genetic compatibility:<\/em> Individuals seek partners that are genetically compatible. A certain proportion of the fitness of the offspring depends on the specific combination of genes (i.e. it's not additive), and individuals that can signal or detect signals in such a way that they can choose compatible partners will have an evolutionary advantage. The best example is scent (e.g. preference for dissimilar MHC immune genes - see the human t-shirt experiment).<\/p>\n\n<p>These mechanisms are well known in theory, but not always well-supported by evidence (yet). <a href=\"http://www.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2010_syllabus/2010_readings/Anderson-Simmons_2006.pdf\">This is probably the best reference<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9451,"question_id":7568,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1374850293}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7568/why-does-sexual-selection-evolve-beautiful-features","last_activity_date":1443886574,"creation_date":1363664616,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why does sexual selection evolve beautiful features?","body":"<p>I have a very raw understanding of sexual selection:<\/p>\n\n<p>Say a group of females of a certain species \"likes\" some feature of a certain groups of males; by \"like\" I mean some behaviour that makes this group of females tend to mate with males having this feature, then the females are selecting their genes which make them feel appealed to males with the feature, and then this process becomes exponent since the group of females becomes bigger and forces the population of males to have this feauture, until an equilibrium is reached.

In essence, a cell which a virus is meant to successfully infect must not only possess a receptor to that virus for adhesion, but also the ability to replicate the virus (so it needs the machinery!). So these cells must be susceptible <em>and<\/em> permissive!<\/p>\n\n<p>After adhesion you end up with an entry phase, this differs by virus, but you can essentially break it down into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#Entry_via_Genetic_Injection\" rel=\"nofollow\">endocytosis, membrane fusion, or injection<\/a>. You can get an idea of injection from something like lambda phage, outlined <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage#Infection\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. Enveloped viruses can fuse with the host membranes because these envelopes are often derived from ER, golgi network, or another plasma membrane. (Remember, viruses are essentially coding 3 basic sets of genes: for structure, replication and binding. It can't just code for everything it needs, either, so viruses hijack the host cell machinery to replicate.) Naked viruses, those that are just a protein coat and nucleic acid in essence, enter the cell through endocytosis and end up uncoating in a vesicle. And to stress it again, if the cell didn't have a receptor for the virus, it probably didn't get it. Portal of entry does make a difference, but I'm trying to keep it simple for our purposes!<\/p>\n\n<p>Being said, when we're considering most viruses, membrane fusion and endocytosis aren't really using any energy but the host cell's, right? And then when the virus gets in there, they continue to use the host's resources becauase they really didn't bring a lot of baggage, either!<\/p>\n\n<p>On the matter of \"knowing\" what they're doing, viral particles really don't do anything themselves. What I'd argue is that they've evolved methods of becoming particularly good at being viruses, many of which make it seem like they're making conscious choices, but suppose the following: Most of the time, viruses are probably just reproducing in such great numbers that it's just <em>faster<\/em> to get lucky and produce a strain with a better overall fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mind you, this whole time your body is attempting to fight off the virus, as in HIV, for example, eukaryotic cells have methods at each stage of attempting to protect themselves,<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/u2Knk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/u2Knk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863583/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cellular Self-Defense: How Cell-Autonomous Immunity Protects Against Pathogens<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You also have NK cells and macrophages responding to IFN produced by cells distressed by viruses, and eventually the presentation of viral antigens which result in effector T cells and antibodies unique to the virus in question. Another article <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331687/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> shows some methods by which some inhibitors of HIV infection can be evaded by the virus, as well, and just as likely, you also see that HIV has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology_of_HIV/AIDS\" rel=\"nofollow\">mechanisms of evading innate/active immunity<\/a> as well! For example, if your antibodies recognize a viral capsid protein, what do they have to bind to if there's a lipid membrane in the way, as in HIV? What if the receptor composition changes?<\/p>\n\n<p>In closing, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. They need you to survive, but their objective is to replicate, so sometimes they do end up killing their host, but they aren't really communicating with each other in a fashion like: \"I wonder how those other viruses are doing?\" They really don't have a means of responding like that, so the end goal? Just keep moving from host to host and keep replicating, in the most basic sense.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39222,"question_id":39220,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39220/viruses-alive-or-not","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/health/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"medical specialists, students, dietitians, and anyone with health-related questions","favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/health/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/health/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"health","open_beta_date":1429747200,"site_state":"open_beta","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.health.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.health","name":"Health Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=health.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1427760000,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://health.stackexchange.com","name":"Health"},"on_date":1443819951,"question_id":3309},"last_activity_date":1443830327,"creation_date":1443817174,"answer_count":1,"title":"Viruses.

Something is considered alive when it has a metabolism, takes in nutrients and expels waist.  It has to have some kind of respiratory system and it's own reproductive mechanism. Although locomotion is optional, most forms of life have some form of getting around.  Some plants are able to move somehow...<\/p>\n\n<p>Viruses have no sensing organs and no method of locomotion.  They cannot smell or see or move on their own.  This means they have to be carried inside a cell or if free floating in a host's fluids, rely on random motions to get about.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to invade, as far as I understand this; they must essentially wait until they come into physical contact with a compatible target.  At this point, their protrusions (I call them \"keys\") attach to a host cells \"door\" and they then inject their DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most (or all?) cells use Mitochondria for \"power\" so they can do things - like metabolize and reproduce.  I've never seen a diagram of a virus that shows where it get's it's energy to power the 'injection' part of it's 'life cycle'.<\/p>\n\n<p>How is this done?<\/p>\n\n<p>In the mouse video, the HIV virus looks like it has a \"plan\" and that it knows how to select which initial cells to invade and then how to pick a good method of remaining hidden.  How can this be when they have no sense organs?  How can they \"know\" of other virus particles are being successfully attacked by the host? <\/p>\n\n<p>This is incredible and incredibly complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not a medical professional.

They would need to do more homework than these papers.  <em>The discussion of vestigial centromere sequences and telomere motifs being inverted is interesting, though contrary views have been <a href=\"http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">written up<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/c.fus.les.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">elsewhere<\/a>.<\/em>  I'm not going to review that evidence as I think its not primary to the question at hand...<\/p>\n\n<p>I would point out that the centromere and telomere sequences are highly repetitive - they are so repetitive that they are often associated with unreliable sequencing in a typical genome build.  While its possible some will be found in future builds of the human genome, such sequences are just as likely to have been excised during mitosis or by mutation.  There would be strong selection pressure for them to be excised quickly; having two centromeres on one chromosome would probably be a fatal trait and the same is probably true for telomerase susceptible sequences in the middle of a chromosomal arm is too.  A lot has happened at the point of fusion and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee_genome_project#Genes_of_the_Chromosome_2_fusion_site\" rel=\"nofollow\">150 kB of DNA seems to have included itself which is not from the original Chr 2A or 2B<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think there is some confusion here: The fusion models examined do not predict the fusion from the local configuration of bases.  <em>The main evidence for fusion has always been the fact that the two pieces of human chromosome 2 are nearly identical to chromosomes 2A and 2B of apes - typically 96-98% identical.<\/em>  The genes are almost entirely in the same order, the inter-genic regions are very similar All along the 2A/2B length - millions of bases.  The site of fusion ad models for its occurrence is merely confirming what we already - <a href=\"http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">there are two chromosomes somehow stuck together<\/a>.  Since both papers focus on the site of combination and do not adequately address this primary piece of information, they seem to be missing this point. <\/p>\n\n<p>The chances are infinitesimal that human chr 2 were to resemble those of other primates at random.   This is what you say in science when you mean 'impossible'.  One simply doesn't see a segment of DNA the size of Chr 2A and 2B being so similar for such a length when we look at rats, dogs, worms or any more distantly related living thing.  But for every primate the relationship corresponds to humans the same way.  In addition studies show that these <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/11/1651.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">highly similar blocks of DNA sit right next to the site of fusion<\/a> and show a crossover where the fusion probably occurred.  Some recent hominids - Neanderthals and <a href=\"http://biologos.org/blog/denisovans-humans-and-the-chromosome-2-fusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Denisovans<\/a> had the chr 2 fusion as well.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I have to say is that there's always a chance that chromosome 2 fusion did not happen though in my view <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA\" rel=\"nofollow\">there's a tremendous amount of evidence that it did<\/a>.  The second most likely explanation is that all the other apes had their chromosome 2 break into 2 pieces at some susceptible site. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>I don't quite agree that chromosome 2 fusion is an indispensable or even leading piece of evidence that means that humans and the other primates are interrelated.<\/em>  That question is a different kettle of fish and the relationship between Human chromosome 2 and the chromosomes of other primates is just one contributing point.  All the other chromosome sequences in primates are the same, and nearly every gene in human beings is closer to primates than to other animals.  If they had not found chromosome 2 fusion in the genome sequences few if anybody would have worried about it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As to your last question - I don't know if its <em>necessary<\/em> that chromosomal fusion must occur in every living thing, but it appears that it has.  In fact what we see as we look at all the diverse chromosomes being sequenced, is that <em>most chromosomes have been merged or rearranged over and over again.<\/em>  Over long periods of evolutionary time, a typical chromosome looks like a patchwork quilt stitched up from pieces of other chromosomes.  These relationships are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny\" rel=\"nofollow\">synteny<\/a>, which reaffirm the thesis that all living things came from a single point of origin, if you go back far enough.  Really, the fusion point of Chr2 is interesting because its a relatively new event; by picking through the pieces we might find some understanding of something that appears to be a common phenomenon in genome dynamics.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X9xRl.jpg\" alt=\"Human Mouse synteny, Human Chr 7\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The above image comes from a <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/1/1.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">review of methods to identify syntenic regions<\/a>.

Hu chr 7 is 158 million bases long, so even a small band (> 1/1000th of the full length) on this chart means 100,000s of bases. <\/p>\n\n<p>If all these syntenic relationships are considered together they can <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/1/37.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">construct chromosomal rearrangement events that compare with the phylogenetic tree<\/a> and typically verify speciation events that separate the two organisms being compared.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Whoops - just found this.  Take a look at this <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1051/can-two-humans-with-44-chromosomes-produce-viable-offspring\">Biology.SE<\/a> question: it refers to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsonian_translocation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robertsonian translocation<\/a> where the long arms of several of the chromosomes chr 14, 15, 16, 21 and 22 are known to sometimes fuse, resulting in viability.  The answer there is useful - these variants don't tend to produce offspring, but it only takes one time.  Its only happened once in the past 5 million years or so.  So another point of view there. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>That should't discourage the authors from trying again.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>All this being said, as a scientific question I'd rather have a discussion like this, based on evidence and facts that anyone can evaluate.

To quote popular science blogger, <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/07/23/and-finally-the-hounding-duck-can-rest/#.U6fwp_ldW1c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carl Zimmer<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ends of chromosomes are very vulnerable places. If they simply dangle loosely, DNA-cutting enzymes can nibble away at them, destroying the genes they encounter. The dangling end of one chromosome can also get attached to the dangling end of another, fusing chromosomes together. We are mostly protected from such changes thanks to special proteins called telomerases. They tack on little repeating bits of DNA, which form a loop\u2013a telomere\u2013so that chromosomes end as a hairpin curve, rather than dangling ends.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is this loop that prevents chromosomes from undergoing the type of fusion that we see in the second chromosome. Now telomeres naturally shorten and become mutated with age. If we encountered two fused chromosomes (with the telomeres joined end to end) we should expect that this could only happen where the telomeres are short enough and mutated enough to allow this to happen. Only when they can no longer form that protective loop, can they become fused.<\/p>\n\n<p>Experiments like <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9335332\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> have shown that defective telomeres with few repeats are vulnerable to chromosome fusion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is what the fusion site <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/CJRRUGo.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">actually looks like<\/a> - the highlighted repeating elements (TTAGGG and CCCTAA) are those that are still perfectly formed. If I relax my criteria a little and also highlight those repeating elements that have just one single mutation, this is what the fusion <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/r7d0Woa.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">site looks like<\/a>. To raise doubts that what we are looking at here are a series of repeats of \"TTAGGG\" joined to a series of repeats of \"CCCTAA\" is either asinine or dishonest.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Telomere motifs, both forward and reverse (TTAGGG and CCTAAA), populate both sides of the purported fusion site. Forward motifs should only be found on the left side of the fusion site and reverse motifs on the right side <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>(Note: it is CCCTAA not CCTAAA)<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>This is just pure nonsense, I am tempted even to call it a lie but I can't be sure. I have looked into this claim by searching through the 20,000 bases that surround the fusion site. \nIn those 20,000 bases there is exactly 1 instance of TTAGGG that occurs before the fusion site and 1 instance of CCCTAA that occurs before the fusion site (No more than we should expect to occur by chance alone in any sequence this long).<\/p>\n\n<p>After the fusion site (and away from it), there is 1 more instance of CCCTAA and 3 more instances of TTAGGG (No more than we should expect to occur by chance alone in any sequence this long).<\/p>\n\n<p>Don't take my word for it. <a href=\"https://db.tt/aKV6jN50\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here are 20,023 bases<\/a> that surround the fusion site.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The 798-base core fusion-site sequence is not unique to the purported fusion site, but found throughout the genome with 80% or greater identity internally on nearly every chromosome; indicating that it is some type of ubiquitous higher-order repeat.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like more rubbish (even a lie perhaps). Using BLAT to search for the <a href=\"https://db.tt/gqxBG3h8\" rel=\"nofollow\">actual sequence<\/a>, there is no location in the human genome except for this place on chromosome 2 where we see a sequence of repeating TTAGGG joined to a sequence of repeating CCCTAA.

Once again, the only hit that includes both the TTAGGG and the CCCTAA is in this exact location on chromosome 2.<\/p>\n\n<p>We do unsurprisingly find sequences of repeating TTAGGG but what makes this fusion site unique is that those repeats are followed by repeating CCCTAA - that isn't found anywhere else in our genome of over 3 billion base pairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Think about that for a moment.

The 798 bases he talks about are just the telomeric repeats. If they are telomeric repeats then they will be found on the telomeres of chromosomes 2A and 2B. Perhaps he made a mistake here and was talking about the wider region surrounding this fusion site? <\/p>\n\n<p>It is true that there is a lack of synteny in the wider region surrounding this.<\/p>\n\n<p>This became well understood with the sequencing of the gorilla genome.

Where does he get this nonsense from? I have downloaded the alphoid sequences from the defunct centromere on human chromosome 2 and used BLAT (against Chimpanzee Feb 2011) to find their homologs in the chimpanzee. Unsurprisingly they are exactly where we expect to find them on chimpanzee chromosome 2B - <em>where there is a functional centromere<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Think about that for a moment.

I can tell you that these alphoid sequences occur frequently at centromeres all over the human genome from X to 22. More importantly they are appear almost exclusively at centromeres. For example, alphoid 2 appears at centromeres on the following chromosomes: 21, 9 (twice), 11 (twice), 20 (twice), 7 (3x), 22 (5x), 16, 14, 15, 5.<\/p>\n\n<p>It appears once at an unexpected location on chromosome 9 where there isn't a centromere, but that exact location is rich in other alphoid sequences suggesting that it too is a defunct centromere (or was perhaps duplicated from another centromere).<\/p>\n\n<p>This will also be covered in that detailed write-up I mentioned.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>edit (2 Oct 2015):<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>I promised to follow up on this post with a detailed write-up on the fossil centromere on chromosome 2.

Its just a matter of how much genome space you want to dedicate to mating and there can be 2 mating types of 10,000 mating types - the only rule is that you can't mate with your own mating type.

While mammals possess several adaptations to a terrestrial life cycle, including internal fertilization and gestation, which require substantial anatomic specialization between males and females, these are all secondary features that evolved long after our aquatic ancestors had acquired two distinct sexes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, if we look at animals like fish, which reproduce via external fertilization, it's not at all obvious why they might not have more than two sexes.  After all, for many aquatic animals, mating involves little more than the female and the male releasing their respective gametes into the water, where they meet and fuse to a form new zygote, which can then divide and grow into a new adult.  Seen that way, there seems to be no reason why there could not be more than two \"mating types\", as in many fungi, such that gametes of any two distinct types could fuse into zygote.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in the fact that the male and female gametes aren't actually that similar: the female gametes, or eggs, are typically large cells that contain all the nutrients necessary for the new zygote to develop into a viable individual, whereas the male gametes, or sperm, are tiny and produced in huge numbers.  This asymmetry is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisogamy\">anisogamy<\/a>, and modeling its origin has been an important topic in the theoretical study of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Without going into details on the evolution of anisogamy, once it exists, it clearly forces the mating types to also split into two groups: there's no advantage in two microgametes (sperm) fusing, since the resulting zygote would lack the nutrients it needs to be viable, whereas the fusion of two macrogametes (eggs) would simply be inefficient &mdash; eggs, being large, are comparatively rare and expensive, and wasting two of them to produce only one offspring would be suboptimal even if the resulting zygote was viable.  Nor is there really room in such a scheme for gametes of intermediate size: they'd be too small to fuse into a viable zygote with sperm, but too large to be produced in sufficient amounts to be effective in fertilizing eggs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, there's nothing that would stop a single adult from producing both micro- and macrogametes, but such an adult would not really be a third sex &mdash; it would just be male and female at the same time, a mating strategy known as (simultaneous) hermaphroditism, which indeed occurs relatively often in nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, if pretty much all animals are anisogamous, why do fungi remain isogamous (and often have multiple mating types), then?  Well, one explanation is that the main drivers for the evolution of anisogamy &mdash; sperm competition and transportation risk &mdash; don't really apply to fungi, which mate when two sessile haploid mycelia grow and come into contact with each other.  Since the gametes are not motile, there's no advantage for either/any sex to produce more of them (at the cost of smaller size) in order to increase the chance of successful mating.  Thus, isogamous mating works fine for the lifestyle of fungi, and having multiple mating types is then a useful adaptation to make successful mating between neighboring mycelia more likely.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2796,"question_id":2738,"up_vote_count":18},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f137c8bccd23ae845550c5e95c1e31b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4821,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4821/rodrigo","reputation":478,"display_name":"Rodrigo"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1443566997,"creation_date":1443566997,"body":"<p>Richard Dawkins describes an elegant solution to the puzzle in his memorable Selfish Gene: in the beginning, all gametes were similar, and many sexes could coexist (like in fungus).

In particular in both skin and mucosa (both referred to as \"epithelial\" tissues), when there is a break, platelets and clotting factors clot off any bleeding vessels, white blood cells (neutrophils and macrophages in particular) collect and destroy any bacteria, dead cells and muck, and then the process of regeneration occurs (with ongoing inflammation), where stem cells in the surrounding tissue regrow cells, new blood vessels may be formed and scar tissue is laid down to give extra strength. Eventually after these stages of healing, there is \"remodelling\" where the structure basically gets better.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kr34a.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As to why oral wounds heal quickly and don't get infected that much? There are a bunch of reasons. One is that the head and neck has an excellent blood supply- just think of scalp wounds where you bleed like crazy but then they heal very well. Another is that mucous membranes have immune functions that stop invading microbes. Generally speaking we divide this into \"innate\" immunity which is a general response, and \"adaptive\" immunity which is tailored towards specific bugs. The mucosa has both. There are neutrophils and macrophages (innate) which live in that area, there are lymphoid patches (like lymph nodes, and adaptive), there are immunoglobulins specific to mucosa (IgA) which is adaptive in nature, and the epithelial lining cells themselves will signal to the rest of the immune system if there is damage or an infection. Plus, saliva itself has chemicals and enzymes which break down oral bugs.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vU03f.jpg\" alt=\"Oral immunity\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the oral bacteria themselves are not particularly invasive. Just think, every time you brush your teeth, you cause multiple abrasions in your mouth.

Some proteins act as hub proteins, highly connected to others, whereas some others have few interactions. The dysfunction of some interactions causes many diseases, including cancer. Proteins interact through their interfaces. Therefore, studying the interface properties of cancer-related proteins will help explain their role in the interaction networks. Similar or overlapping binding sites should be used repeatedly in single interface hub proteins, making them promiscuous. Alternatively, multi-interface hub proteins make use of several distinct binding sites to bind to different partners. We propose a methodology to integrate protein interfaces into cancer interaction networks (ciSPIN, cancer structural protein interface network). The interactions in the human protein interaction network are replaced by interfaces, coming from either known or predicted complexes. We provide a detailed analysis of cancer related human protein-protein interfaces and the topological properties of the cancer network. The results reveal that cancer-related proteins have smaller, more planar, more charged and less hydrophobic binding sites than non-cancer proteins, which may indicate low affinity and high specificity of the cancer-related interactions. We also classified the genes in ciSPIN according to phenotypes. Within phenotypes, for breast cancer, colorectal cancer and leukemia, interface properties were found to be discriminating from non-cancer interfaces with an accuracy of 71%, 67%, 61%, respectively. In addition, cancer-related proteins tend to interact with their partners through distinct interfaces, corresponding mostly to multi-interface hubs, which comprise 56% of cancer-related proteins, and constituting the nodes with higher essentiality in the network (76%). We illustrate the interface related affinity properties of two cancer-related hub proteins: Erbb3, a multi interface, and Raf1, a single interface hub. The results reveal that affinity of interactions of the multi-interface hub tends to be higher than that of the single-interface hub. These findings might be important in obtaining new targets in cancer as well as finding the details of specific binding regions of putative cancer drug candidates.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-012-0755-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tools for protein-protein interaction network analysis in cancer research<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>From the abstract:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As cancer is a complex disease, the representation of a malignant cell as a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and its subsequent analysis can provide insight into the behaviour of cancer cells and lead to the discovery of new biomarkers. The aim of this review is to help life-science researchers without previous computer programming skills to extract meaningful biological information from such networks, taking advantage of easyto-use, public bioinformatics tools. It is structured in four parts: the first section describes the pipeline of consecutive steps from network construction to biological hypothesis generation. The second part provides a repository of public, user-friendly tools for network construction, visualisation and analysis. Two different and complementary approaches of network analysis are presented: the topological approach studies the network as a whole by means of structural graph theory, whereas the global approach divides the PPIN into sub-graphs, or modules. In section three, some concepts and tools regarding heterogeneous molecular data integration through a PPIN are described. Finally, the fourth part is an example of how to extract meaningful biological information from a colorectal cancer PPIN using some of the described tools.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":39142,"question_id":39120,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1443517532}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39120/how-to-find-a-cancer-ppi-network-data","last_activity_date":1443693738,"creation_date":1443448360,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to find a Cancer PPI network data","body":"<p>I need a Protein Protein Interactions network of Cancer (any type - just I want a PPI of any type cancer), I search and see DIP PPI and ....<\/p>\n\n<p>How to specify that is  Cancer PPI and how to get a PPI of Cancer ?<\/p>\n","question_id":39120,"tags":["bioinformatics","cancer","protein-interaction"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":39142,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"unclear what you're asking","is_answered":true,"view_count":83,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1443693738},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19a3374fef34dc09ea6e80a5b05c2d8f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3141,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3141/laggingreflex","reputation":446,"display_name":"laggingreflex","accept_rate":93},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":23264,"edited":false,"creation_date":1413630889,"comment_id":36371,"body":"What do you mean by &quot;plastic&quot;?

There are no proven or accepted view on this. There are a few theories as to how this happens. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am quoting it:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are several beliefs for what causes frequent urination from anxiety, and the likelihood is that all of these factors play a role:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Muscle Tension \u2013 This is one of the most likely causes of frequent urination. When you have anxiety, your muscles get very tense. This tension puts pressure on your bladder, which in turn makes you feel like you need to urinate more than you would otherwise.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Evolutionary Adaptation \u2013 Another theory is that there is an evolutionary reason that frequent urination would be advantageous. Remember, anxiety is the misfiring of your healthy fight/flight system. In times of fear, urination may keep the body lighter by losing extra weight, making it easier to flee.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Light Overload \u2013 It's also possible that, because anxiety is a misfiring of the fight/flight system, your body may simply be lightly overloaded. The fear is not intense enough to cause immediate urination, but it may make it harder for you to feel like you can hold it back.\n  Also, those with anxiety are more prone to focusing on different sensations unintentionally. There are often times when you may feel the need to urinate slightly but your body has no problem ignoring the feeling and holding it back. With anxiety, it's possible that your brain is focused on the sensation, potentially causing you to feel like you need to urinate more than you do.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, anxiety can also change your body chemistry, altering your digestion and changing the way you process nutrients. That may cause more water to pass through your body.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Source:<a href=\"http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/signs/urination-problems\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/signs/urination-problems<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":29869,"question_id":28578,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1424791565},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/214ff1ea0cbbe0819244fdb421495363?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8540/eftekhari","reputation":385,"display_name":"Eftekhari"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uonSZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15272,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15272/lightweaver","reputation":740,"display_name":"lightweaver","accept_rate":43},"score":0,"post_id":29995,"edited":false,"creation_date":1443534690,"comment_id":65445,"body":"Your last two links both state that an increase in adrenaline causes renal flow rate to decrease.

Cellulose effectively serves only one purpose in organisms that digest it: energy production. Eventually, it is broken down into H<sub>2<\/sub>O and CO<sub>2<\/sub>, both of which are excreted.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throughout the millennia, getting calories was not that difficult, but getting enough essential micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and amino acids) as humans moved into different environments has been where there was selective pressure. Selective pressure for other calorie sources, such as cellulose, has never really happened. Beyond this, there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_density\" rel=\"nofollow\">a ratio of optimal caloric intake to optimal nutrition intake<\/a> a human should get from his diet for that human and humanity in general. A mutation or sudden symbiosis with gut bacteria  that allowed for cellulose digestion would make it even more difficult to keep that ratio, but it is non-optimal situations where selective pressure occurs. The issue here, in my opinion, is that that would be too great a selective pressure on decreasing the micronutritional requirements. The human would far too easily get calories and need to eat many times more in calories what he needed to get the necessary nutrition. So actually, there is selective pressure against cellulose digestion. Further, because of the way humans are built and the other great primates, this sudden mutation or symbiosis seems very unlikely. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, cellulose already serves a vital purpose in the gut. It is commonly called fiber, and allows the feces in the colon to remain moist enough to be passed. Some mammals have adapted colons that can pass very dry feces (the Camel's feces is so dry that you can start a fire with it), but they are typically arid climate species, where water is by far the most precious resource. So the selective pressure was on water intake, not calorie intake.<\/p>\n\n<p>So there has been no selective pressures on humans to digest cellulose, nor will there ever be, so long as there is such a high need for vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids. Such selective pressure would take the form of there first being super nutrient rich foods (relative to humans), then that same food becoming calorie poor. Basically, humans would have to start replacing a meal or two per day with only vitamin supplements. Even with that, the only mammals I know of that digest cellulose are actually utilizing symbiotic gut bacteria to do so. I can't imagine the clever way humans might get that bacteria into their own guts. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Actually, I can.<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":14425,"question_id":10265,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1389541579},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":14441,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389599739,"comment_id":19090,"body":"You make a good point.

This is true for yeasts as well for example for human cells. The only thing that happens over time is that the telomeres at the end of the chromosomes get shorter (unless the cell has an active telomerase which most cells doesn't) and it reaches the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit\">Hayflick limit<\/a> where every further division will lead to a shortage of coding chromosmal regions and thus cause problems. If cells do not acquire any other chromosomal damage and have enough ressources, this would be the limit for their lifetime.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course there are DNA damages occuring over time. Most of them are either repaired by the highly efficient DNA damage repair system of eukaryotic cells, which consists of different checkpoints during the cell cycle. These checkpoints are located at transition between the different  phases of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle\">cell cycle<\/a>. If a DNA damage is identified, the cell cycle is stopped to enable a DNA damage repair by special proteins and to prevent that damaged cells undergo mitosis (here the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2-M_DNA_damage_checkpoint\">G2-M checkpoint<\/a> is important). This works schematically like in this figure (from the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair\">DNA repair<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9MwBD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>If the DNA damage cannot be resolved, cells will either go into senescence (basically go into a permanent dormant state) or undergo apoptosis. If there are damages which are (for whatever reasons) are either not spotted or occur during the repair of DNA double strand breaks by non-homologous end joining, these are then replicated and inherited by further generations. Unless these errors occur during the replication process mother and daughter cells are genetically identical.<\/p>\n\n<p>So eukaryotic cells acquire DNA damage over time (one of the reasons why late pregnancies pose a greater risk than early), but we are different from yeast in one point: Yeast has an active telomerase, which is not active in most of our cells (mainly except in stem cells). If the cells collect too much chromosmal damages than they will die.<\/p>\n\n<p>The references listed below go deeper into the topic and are interesting to read.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/6/1487.full\">Negative regulation of yeast telomerase activity through an\ninteraction with an upstream region of the DNA primer<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3879/6827pimy_pdf.htm\">Cell cycle control in the kidney.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3873/yxu4u4se_pdf.htm\">The evolution of diverse biological responses to DNA damage:\ninsights from yeast and p53<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3873/8dbvh7hd_pdf.htm\">DNA damage and decisions: CtIP coordinates DNA repair and cell cycle\ncheckpoints<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3873/oli52vv2_pdf.htm\">Cellular Responses to DNA Damage: One Signal, Multiple Choices<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":27871,"question_id":27790,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1422266964},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f437d9a11deebd214089822c26197f35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3553,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3553/james","reputation":4533,"display_name":"James","accept_rate":83},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDE10.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10104,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10104/vgranin","reputation":724,"display_name":"VGranin","accept_rate":65},"score":0,"post_id":28033,"edited":false,"creation_date":1422262280,"comment_id":45643,"body":"So you telling that one of three major theories of aging is boolshit?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDE10.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10104,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10104/vgranin","reputation":724,"display_name":"VGranin","accept_rate":65},"score":0,"post_id":28033,"edited":false,"creation_date":1422264423,"comment_id":45645,"body":"Also you telling us that there is no cancer."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f437d9a11deebd214089822c26197f35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3553,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3553/james","reputation":4533,"display_name":"James","accept_rate":83},"score":0,"post_id":28033,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDE10.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10104,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10104/vgranin","reputation":724,"display_name":"VGranin","accept_rate":65},"edited":false,"creation_date":1422268532,"comment_id":45648,"body":"No &amp; No. The damage is rare, but it does occur so much that cancers may develop naturally in animals and may cause ageing over time.

He touches on the DNA damage theory. <\/p>\n\n<h1>DNA damage theory of ageing.<\/h1>\n\n<p>Note that when talking about DNA damage theory, we are specifically talking about damage to the process of cell renewal by DNA damage repair mechanisms in stem cells.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutation ageing is not the same as DNA damage causing ageing and cannot really cause ageing in yeast.<\/strong> The idea that cells <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_aging#Mutation_theories_of_aging\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquire damage over time due to mutated DNA<\/a> is fundamentally different to the DNA damage theory of ageing. The mechanisms that lead to DNA damage are covered very well in @Chris' answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The suggested systemic effect that DNA damage has in the human body causes an inability to renew cells due to a lack of viable stem cells. This contributes to the process of ageing in the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>In yeast, this stem cell depletion process does not happen (they are single cellular mostly). <em>In the comments it appears that you are actually talking about mutation based ageing in your original question.<\/em> Mutations are passed to daughter cells. But these daughter cells don't appear to age or to die quicker (If the parental cell is 5 days old, the daughter cell does not appear to be 5 days old). This is the fundamental reason why this form of ageing remains less studied - <strong>it doesn't really make sense that general mutations cause ageing.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<h1>Summary<\/h1>\n\n<p>To directly answer the question: <strong>\"How does DNA damage cause ageing in yeast?\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The question doesn't quite capture the whole picture and confuses DNA damage theory of animal ageing with general DNA damage at a cellular level. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many theories of ageing. Nobody knows which ones have more or less influence on ageing. Yeast is a good model for some kinds of age theory modelling, but perhaps not in the case of DNA damage based ageing. Although they experience DNA damage in the form of mutation, this doesn't cause ageing in the same way that DNA damage might cause ageing in humans because they are single celled organisms, and don't experience the same inter-tissue relationships that more complex organisms have.<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\n <br><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><br>\n<br><\/p>\n\n<h1>Edits<\/h1>\n\n<p><em>This answer has been changed extensively since its first draft based on additional questions and queries from the OP in the comments. I decided to keep some important points that were raised and dismissed.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why there is no DNA damage transfer at all, to daughter cell?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>DNA damage can occur and <strong><em>is<\/em><\/strong> transferred to the daughter cell. Damage is very rare though. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So how yeast survive? Human stem cells aging and die, or get cancer. But yeast no. Human start from one cell. And die. Yeast start from one cell and live forever (dividing again and again) <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Edit After Comments:<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Single cell<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In yeast there are no inter-tissue systems. Mutated damage is simply passed on if the cell is viable. Also the assumption that they live forever isn't entirely accurate. But the DNA is passed on in its mutated or damaged form.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi cell<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>DNA damage based ageing is a big problem for animals. (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12071/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dolle <em>et al<\/em> 2013<\/a>) Showed that DNA damage to a single repair pathway causes accelerated ageing, (but note that there was not an increase in mutation during this ageing).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>but you talking about cancer, it's not so good example, my mistake.  But in humans aging NOT like cancer - it occur in ALL the body and all the cells. So in all cells there are some DNA damage.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Another edit:<\/strong> You were right to talk about cancer in this context. The DNA damage theory of ageing is that small changes (damage) in our DNA accumulate over time and damage cell types by damaging various DNA repair pathways. <\/p>\n\n<p>Damage accumulates and over time less <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_aging#Long-lived_stem_cells\" rel=\"nofollow\">stem cells for renewal are viable and cellular repair of other damaged cells slows down<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also this same fundamental principle of mutation damage happening over time can lead to mutations that switch off cell control mechanisms and lead to cancer. Although these these mutations do not increase in rate with age (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15690342\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hill <em>et al.,<\/em> 2005<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>For example the naked mole rat lives 10 times that of comparable species (less ageing) and have not been observed to naturally acquire cancer (less cancer). The theory implies that the two things are quite linked because of the way DNA changes, but not that specifically mutation is a cause or result of ageing. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I talking more about aging. Because there is aging in yeast. And one of aging theories for human - accumulating DNA damage. So what <em>Chris<\/em> writing is that it's really rare. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>**Stem cells are damaged. ** I'm no longer entirely sure of what you mean by ageing in yeast. Yeast aren't reliant on a limited number of stem cells for cellular renewal, they don't age in the way you might be thinking. They simply proliferate the mutated cell type. There is no impact to a larger organism like in human ageing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DNA damage.<\/strong> Yeast is a very helpful organism for understanding the underlying biochemistry and genetics of ageing, not the overall ageing systems. These are two different fields of study.

Itch is a major somatic sensation, along with (and different from) pain, temperature, and touch. Itch can be an acute sensation, e.g. a mosquito bite, or a chronic condition (peripheral or internal disease). <\/p>\n\n<p>Research on itch signaling is still at its infancy, and basic mechanisms by which the itch sensation is transmitted and regulated have yet to be fully understood. It is meant to give us information about how we are interacting with our environment. Loss of such fine sensation, such as occurs with Hansen's Disease - aka leprosy, where patches of skin become painless and do not itch, so are ignored by the patient - leads to festering wounds and resultant problems. <\/p>\n\n<p>As @MattDMo stated in a comment, sensation allows us to respond appropriately to irritants which, if ignored, might lead to festering wounds: thorns and other foreign bodies, sucking or biting insects (parasites or other, which can act as disease vectors as well), etc. It allows us to learn how to avoid and treat such irritants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Various types of itch can be classified by the origin of the itch, which could be skin-related, neuropathic, systemic, or psychogenic. The most common cause of itching is dry skin; tiny cracks in the skin cause an inflammatory response, which (within reason) is not a problem in and of itself. The response to the itch, though, can be beneficial or damaging. One can treat dry skin, wash off irritants, treat infections, avoid causes, etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>Scratching can be benign if done sensibly, or it can injure the skin, allowing infection, etc. However, the benefit of having such sensation under normal circumstances certainly outweighs the inconvenience.<\/p>\n\n<p>That is not to say that pathological conditions that cause itching are not problematic. They are, and one might reasonably curse the sensation under those circumstances.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited to add<\/strong>: Itching, or pruritus, is defined as an unpleasant cutaneous sensation that serves as a physiological self-protective mechanism to prevent the body from being hurt by harmful external agents.

There is not such a thing as an itch receptor. Due to the neural circuitry involved, rubbing a painful bruise actually dulls the pain due to stimulation of the tactile sense (<a href=\"http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/55/4/282.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kakigi &amp; Shibasaki, 1992<\/a>). This may explain the familiar first action one does when injured - grabbing the injured spot and rub it (cats lick their wounds, likely dulling the pain and cleaning it up at the same time). Given the similarity with the neural processing of pain, it is not surprising that a very similar mechanism applies to scratching - scratching relieves the itchy sensation (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00724.x/abstract;jsessionid=721384A9AEBE306763A93B9693A550EE.f02t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nillson et al., 2003<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So while evolutionary explanations may be valid, they can never be proven.

And <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell\">Solar cells<\/a> are indeed pretty dark.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, as Rory <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/451/303\">indicated<\/a>, higher energy photons will only produce heat. This is because the chemical reactions powered by photosynthesis require only a certain amount of energy, and any excessive amount delivered by higher-energy photons cannot be simply used for another reaction<sup>1<\/sup> but will yield heat. I don't know how much trouble that actually causes, but there is another point:<\/p>\n\n<p>As explained, what determines the efficiency of solar energy conversion is not the energy per photon, but the amount of photons available. So you should take a look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight#Composition\">sunlight spectrum<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png\" alt=\"Solar Radiation Spectrum\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The Irradiance is an energy density, however we are interested in photon density, so you have to divide this curve by the energy per photon, which means multiply it by λ/(hc) (that is higher wavelengths need more photons to achieve the same Irradiance). If you compare that curve integrated over the high energy photons (say, λ &lt;&nbsp;580 nm) to the integration over the the low energy ones, you'll notice that despite the atmospheric losses (the red curve is what is left of the sunlight at sea level) there are a lot more \"red\" photons than \"green\" ones, so making leaves red would waste a lot of potentially converted energy<sup>2<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is still no explanation why leaves are not simply black&nbsp;\u2014 absorbing all light is surely even more effective, no? I don't know enough about organic chemistry, but my guess would be that there are no organic substances with such a broad absorption spectrum and adding another kind of pigment might not pay off.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p><sup>1)<\/sup> Theoretically that <em>is<\/em> possible, but it's a highly non-linear process and thus too unlikely to be of real use (in plant medium at least)<br>\n<sup>2)<\/sup> Since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water\">water absorbs red light stronger than green and blue light<\/a> deep sea plants are indeed better off being red, as Marta Cz-C <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/450/why-do-plants-have-green-leaves-and-not-red#comment-469\">mentioned<\/a>.<br>\n<sup>3<\/sup>  And other alternatives, like the semiconductors used in Solar cells, are rather unlikely to be encountered in plants...<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional reading, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/20188\">proposed<\/a> by <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11677/dave-jarvis\">Dave Jarvis<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/4/684.full\">http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/4/684.full<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691134/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691134/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.life.illinois.edu/govindjee/photosynBook/Chapter11.pdf\">http://www.life.illinois.edu/govindjee/photosynBook/Chapter11.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.heliospectra.com/sites/default/files/general/What%20light%20do%20plants%20need_5.pdf\">https://www.heliospectra.com/sites/default/files/general/What%20light%20do%20plants%20need_5.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":462,"question_id":450,"up_vote_count":65,"last_edit_date":1443422454},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cfeec7dfb47b3d98c5edf17295e959b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":81,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/81/poshpaws","reputation":4731,"display_name":"Poshpaws","accept_rate":71},"score":17,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79175a222a9933b9fc278cd94b228bf7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":303,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/303/tobias-kienzler","reputation":774,"display_name":"Tobias Kienzler"},"score":1,"post_id":560,"edited":false,"creation_date":1326268998,"comment_id":605,"body":"nice links, though I doubt black plants are likely to happen anywhere since that would most likely need too many different pigments"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cfeec7dfb47b3d98c5edf17295e959b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":81,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/81/poshpaws","reputation":4731,"display_name":"Poshpaws","accept_rate":71},"score":0,"post_id":560,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79175a222a9933b9fc278cd94b228bf7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":303,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/303/tobias-kienzler","reputation":774,"display_name":"Tobias Kienzler"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1326366539,"comment_id":622,"body":"OK, maybe not completely black but very dark.

Even if black leaves were better, evolution's limitations can prevent species from climbing to the absolute highest peak on the fitness landscape. Berman wrote that achieving pigments that work better than chlorophyll could be very difficult. In fact, all higher plants (embryophytes) are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of green alga \u2013 with the idea being that chlorophyll has evolved only once. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll#Why_green_and_not_black.3F\">reference<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are largely filled with pigment protein complexes that they produce to absorb sunlight. The part of the photosynthesis yield that they invest in this therefore has to be in proportion. The pigment in the lowest layer has to receive enough light to recoup its energy costs, which cannot happen if a black upper layer absorbs all the light. A black system can therefore only be optimal if it does not cost anything (<a href=\"http://www.news.leiden.edu/news/why-are-plants-not-black.html\">reference<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Red and yellow light is longer wavelength, lower energy light, while the blue light is higher energy. It seems strange that plants would harvest the lower energy red light instead of the higher energy green light, unless you consider that, like all life, plants first evolved in the ocean. Sea water quickly absorbs the high-energy blue and green light, so that only the lower energy, longer wavelength red light can penetrate into the ocean. Since early plants and still most plant-life today, lived in the ocean, optimizing their pigments to absorb the reds and yellows that were present in ocean water was most effective. While the ability to capture the highest energy blue light was retained, the inability to harvest green light appears to be a consequence of the need to be able to absorb the lower energy of red light (<a href=\"http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1668\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Some more speculations on the subject. (<a href=\"http://thesymbiont.blogspot.in/2010/09/why-arent-plants-black-true-evo.html\">reference<\/a>)<\/p>\n","answer_id":17836,"question_id":450,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90e27556eca531c724ad6891f7eda991?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16064,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16064/diogenes","reputation":81,"display_name":"diogenes"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433274040,"creation_date":1433274040,"body":"<p>There are several parts to my answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, evolution has selected the current system(s) over countless generations through natural selection.  Natural selection depends on differences (major or minor) in the efficiency of various solutions (fitness) in the light (ho ho!) of the current environment.  Here's where the solar energy spectrum is important as well as local environmental variables such as light absorption by water etc. as pointed out by another responder.  After all that, what you have is what you have and that turns out to be (in the case of typical green plants), chlorophylls A and B and the \"light\" and \"dark\" reactions.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, how does this lead to green plants that appear green?  Absorption of light is something that occurs at the atomic and molecular level and usually involves the energy state of particular electrons.  The electrons in certain molecules are capable of moving from one energy level to another without leaving the atom or molecule.  When energy of a certain level strikes the molecule, that energy is absorbed and one or more electrons move to a higher energy level in the molecule (conservation of energy).  Those electrons with higher energy usually return to the \"ground state\" by emitting or transferring that energy.  One way the energy can be emitted is as light in a process called fluorescence.  The second law of thermodynamics (which makes it impossible to have perpetual motion machines) leads to the emission of light of lower energy and longer wave length.  (n.b. wavelength (lambda) is inversely proportional to energy; long wavelength red light has less energy per photon than does short wavelength violet (ROYGBIV as seen in your ordinary rain bow)).<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, chlorophylls A and B are complex organic molecules (C, H, O, N with a splash of Mg++) with a ring structure.  You will find that a lot of organic molecules that absorb light (and fluoresce as well) have a ring structure in which electrons \"resonate\" by moving around the ring with ease.  It is the resonance of the electrons that determine the absorption spectrum of a given molecule (among other things).  Consult wikipedia article on chlorophyll for the absorption spectrum of the two chlorphylls.  You will note that they absorb best at short wavelengths (blue,indigo,violet) as well as at the long wavelengths (red,orange,yellow) but not in the green.  Since they don't absorb the green wavelengths, this is what is left over and this is what your eye perceives as the color of the leaf.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, what happens to the energy from the solar spectrum that has been temporarily absorbed by the electrons of chlorophyll?  Since its not part of the original question, I'll keep this short (apologies to plant physiologists out there).  In the \"light dependent reaction\", the energetic electrons get transferred through a number of intermediate molecules to eventually \"split\" water into Oxygen and Hydrogen and generate energy-rich molecules of ATP and NADPH. The ATP and NADPH then are used to power the \"light independent reaction\" which takes CO2 and combines it with other molecules to create glucose.  Note that this is how you get glucose (at least eventually in some form, vegan or not) to eat and oxygen to breath.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take a look at what happens when you artificially uncouple the chlorophylls from the transfer system that leads to glucose synthesis.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_fluorescence\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_fluorescence<\/a>  Notice the color of the fluorescence under UV light!<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatives?

The important thing to know about Hill Functions is that they vary either from 0->1 (for activators) or from 1->0 (for inhibitors) as the concentration of the relevant species varies from 0->infinity, with a smooth transition region in between.<br>\nThe min and max operators are meant to stand in for the Boolean operators AND and OR, respectively. In other words, if two of the Hill Functions are related by a min operator, they both have to be in an ON state in order for the overall term to be in an ON state. If the two Hill Functions were instead related by a max operator, only one of them would need to be in the ON state for the term to be in the ON state overall.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second term is a degradation term. It represents how the given species is decreasing with time. The particular form of the degradation term (directly proportional to species concentration) derives from the fact that the main sink for generic biomolecules is dilution via cellular growth and division.<\/p>\n\n<p>The third term (the thing with ∇² in it) is a diffusion term. This describes how the species moves around the in the worm, assuming that it is free to do so (not all proteins/species can exit the cell). Not all of the species have this diffusion term.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Search of Modelspace<\/h2>\n\n<p>Their modelspace search isn't novel either, although some very specific aspects of it may be.<\/p>\n\n<h3>the basics of modelspace search<\/h3>\n\n<p>The basic problem of modelspace search works like this: imagine a generalized form of your model in which every species interacts with every other species in every possible way. Each of the equations will have a (large) set of free parameters associated with it. You then take a set of experimental observations and-using any one of a number of methods-find a set of parameter values such that your model will reproduce those observations. This is called parameter fitting. In order to find the unique set of parameters that describes the \"real\" system that you're trying to model, in general you need at least as many independent experimental observations as you have independent parameters in your model. If you have more parameters than you have data, then you will be able to find infinitely many different parameter sets that reproduce your experimental data.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's where things start to get complicated, and a bit fuzzy. What separates modelspace search from standard parameter fitting is that you usually employ some version of the Principle of Parsimony in modelspace search. The Principle of Parsimony can be thought of as equivalent to Occam's Razor: the simplest model is usually best. In practice, what this means is that when you don't have enough experimental data to uniquely parameterize your model, you should favor versions of your model with as few species-species interactions as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Principle of Parsimony is one specific example of a broad category of modelspace constraints known as \"prior knowledge\". This refers to everything you know in advance about what your final model \"should\" look like. Prior knowledge tends to be specific to the particular modelsearch at hand, and it can be incorporated into the search algorithms in many different ways.<\/p>\n\n<p>With enough prior knowledge the modelsearch can be constrained to an extent such that, in theory, it should become possible to identify the one true parameter set, even when you only have a relatively small set of experimental observations. Good luck constructing a formal proof for that, though. In fact, for a complex system it's usually impossible to quantify the extent to which a given piece of prior knowledge reduces the number of experimental observations required to uniquely fit the parameter set.<\/p>\n\n<h3>the modelspace search in Lobo<\/h3>\n\n<p>For the type of model used in Lobo, a rough calculation says there's going to be<\/p>\n\n<p>$3n^2 + 4n$<\/p>\n\n<p>independent parameters (where n is the number of species). Further, there's going to be a set of parameters that describes whether each species-species interaction is activating or inhibiting, and another set of parameters that describes the Boolean logic of those interactions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"comprehensive\" model in Lobo has 14 species, so there are at least<\/p>\n\n<p>$3\\cdot14^2 + 4\\cdot14 = 644$<\/p>\n\n<p>644 free parameters to fit during the modelspace search. Against those 644 parameters they have exactly 16 independent experimental observations.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34975,"question_id":34973,"up_vote_count":18,"last_edit_date":1443389840},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":20,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433680667,"creation_date":1433669628,"body":"<p>The paper by Lobo and Levin is an attempt to learn a model that represents the inner workings of a biological system by fitting parameters to data. This is a common topic in \"systems biology\", a model-based approach to studying biology that is popular in some fields. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even for small systems, this is a phenomenally hard problem. Unlike most machine learning problems, achieving good accuracy (on independent test sets) is not enough; the model structure itself must be correct, meaning that it should reflect the actual mechanisms operating in the cell or organism. It's like trying to identify the actual structure of an integrated circuit by only observing inputs and outputs --- not only identifying the logical rule that the system exhibits, but the actual wiring diagram that implements that rule. It is of course quite possible that alternative models exist that perfectly captures the behavior, and yet is completely different \"on the inside\". In other words, the system may not be identifiable from the data --- two different models may produce exactly the same behavior. So there's no way to know beforehand if these problems are even theoretically solvable (let alone practically feasible).<\/p>\n\n<p>Lobo and Lewin claim to have accomplished this task for a small system of gene products. As far as I can tell, the central piece of evidence is that the model they come up with does capture some mechanisms previously known to exist. Whether this is just plain luck, overfitting, or a special case where (parts of) the system is actually identifiable from data is hard to tell. But it's notable that Lobo and Levin fall back on demonstrating predictive accuracy in the end, which is not enough to support their thesis. The critical test is to take a <em>new<\/em> prediction from their model and actually test it experimentally, to prove their (strong!) claim that their method can actually infer new mechanisms. Doing so is expensive and time-consuming, and much more difficult to get right than tweaking models to fit mechanisms you already knew beforehand --- which is exactly why I want to see that evidence. If the authors really believe that their method is a breaktrough, those experiments should have been done.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, these type of algorithms are applied to models containing only a handful of components, and typically to systems that have been studied for decades and are very well-characterized to begin with. In most of biology, the problems are orders of magnitude more complex, and often we don't even know what the components are. So I thik there are a limited number of cases where this approach is feasible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34982,"question_id":34973,"up_vote_count":20,"last_edit_date":1433680667},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dc088d12dee08b35a0d323113cd24c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16123,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16123/bob","reputation":246,"display_name":"Bob"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433760916,"creation_date":1433759443,"body":"<p>Christian, great idea to ask this question here before taking important decisions.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Are those media articles a hype?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Yes. Over the last 10 years I constantly see those hype stories in media about \"revolutionary\" large-scale-study/big data projects with mind-blowing numbers (gigabases, teraflops, terabytes, thousands of papers and hundreds of genes).<\/p>\n\n<p>Journalists are competing for readers with pompous titles as well as scientists need to promote their results. I recall that ~7 years ago Russian national TV came up with nothing less than <em>\"Scientists unravel the mystery of Russian soul\"<\/em>, when one of our scientific institutions, close to government, finally managed to actually launch (not buy and put on hold as usual) a next-generation sequencing machine and sequence a full genome. Curiously \"Russian soul\" belongs to half-jewish, half-armenian guy. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Though it's nice that in media papers journalists and scientists managed to explicitly articulate the problem we can't solve: how to predict morphology using molecular biology data. This work is not even close to doing that. It essentially predicts a binary trait, \"heads or tails\".<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is this a new breakthrough approach in science, connecting areas that noone could imagine to connect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>No. This approach is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">Systems Biology<\/a>. It's been getting popular, I'd say, since late 90s-2000s. This paper is not like \"look, I've invented a DNA computer/quantum computer\" etc. It's an ordinary systems biology study, its quality is a matter of discussion.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is this a good systems biology paper?<\/h2>\n\n<p>I don't claim that it's bad. But some things sound strange to me:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I don't think that <em>de-novo<\/em> <strong>predicting<\/strong> the network of interactions should be done by systems biology, when some facts are known from literature and could be enriched by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Omics<\/a>. If you're modelling a molbiol/biochem network, too much freedom might render your network totally different from reality.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Robustness test is unconvincing to me. Ok, \"We dropped 3 crucial papers\" and still network holds. Ok, network predicted some results from papers, not taken into account upon its construction. But this is not a systematic test. Split the data into two parts, optimize the network on one part and test it on another one.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Small number of genes involved in the described process and binary trait in consideration make the authors do overambitious claims, IMHO.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h2>Can a smart and diligent person as yourself make a better career, doing systems biology than something else? Will your higher IQ and/or mathematical background give you an edge?<\/h2>\n\n<p>I think, no. I think, this area downplays the difference in intellect between people, while you might prefer a more discriminating area, even if you allow the assumption that you're not the single brightest person to ever live on Earth. :) <\/p>\n\n<p>You should have worked out (or have from birth) some mental habits (e.g. habit to consider simple examples with small numbers of elements; use modular thinking; not to get stuck with a single approach - switch tricks; etc. etc.) that less smart people lack. Systems biology often works with too complex objects to imagine, thus your edge might be lost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Complexity:<\/p>\n\n<p>In reality cascades of biological pathways include huge numbers of players involved. Moreover often a single protein has several seemingly unrelated functions. I was a bit shocked at first, when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconitase\" rel=\"nofollow\">aconitase<\/a>, a Crebbs-cycle protein turned out to be at the same time an iron-responsive element and regulator of mRNA turnover. What a mad engineer could've created this?! Later I heard that many Crebbs-cycle proteins have seemingly unrelated \"part-time jobs\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Stability of solution:<\/p>\n\n<p>Look at any pathway in <a href=\"http://www.genome.jp/kegg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">KEGG<\/a>. Or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one: a famous cascade of cell signal transfer<\/a>: . Although, it's not that complex, when you know all those proteins by heart, it might be hard to work with it quantitatively. Solutions might be unstable. Lack of experimental data may lead your simulation in a wrong direction. For instance, famous p53 protein (in this cascade it has 3 arrows or so) in reality has more than a hundred counter-agents, loss of interaction with one of them might lead your simulation to a state, critically different from reality.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Publish-ability:<\/p>\n\n<p>Another problem for  systems biology papers is lack of comprehensible results. People are usually interested in a paper, when they can build something on top of it or at least when it's an interesting special case to know about. To be honest, I can't make myself read them.\nWhat's the scientific takeaway of this paper for instance? It doesn't exist. I can't use it as a scientist.<\/p>\n\n<p>Systems biology guys often speak of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism\" rel=\"nofollow\">holism<\/a> approach as opposed to reductionism. To me it's an empty word - the only comprehensible (and thus publishable) way to approach complex entities for human being is modular thinking - you just replace a complex cascade with a black box with a set of inputs/outputs and rates and treat it as a single object, reducing the complexity that way.<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel that systems biology approach is better suited for commercial use in industry than for small-lab science. You need tools to mine data, to visualize results etc. Companies can afford building them for themselves.\nAs for the results, in industry you don't need them to be publishable. In agricultural industry you can optimize producing organism's metabolism with systems biology means to make it output more product of interest e.g. in cows or chemicals-producing organisms (though same goal can often be attained with pure genetic engineering easier). May be pharmacology can be interested in this to optimize their drugs to find best way to modify particular coefficients in particular reactions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Practical achievements based on fundamental biological science still make use of reductionist works. They stem from little facts that cervical carcinoma is caused by a specific virus and vaccination against it seems (silver bullet warning) to prevent it. Or the fact that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5\" rel=\"nofollow\">CCR5<\/a> mutants are seemingly immune to AIDS or similar results for causative agents for stomach cancer or hepatitis. Or useful discoveries of tools, such as siRNAs, Crispr/CAS9 or Tal effectors.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you still decide to give biology a try, it won't take you too long to grasp the molecular biology. You can mostly work with it without knowledge of biology or chemistry. In a month you'll grasp the basic concepts such as replication-transcription-translation, in a year will be familiar with most key processes, in ~3 years will be a good specialist in some area.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35021,"question_id":34973,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1433760916}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34973/120-year-old-gene-regulation-problem-independently-solved-by-a-computer-how","last_activity_date":1443389840,"creation_date":1433626712,"answer_count":3,"title":"120-year-old gene regulation problem independently solved by a computer.

And I would definitely recommend you learn all of these things well before you attempt to understand molecular inheritance, but let me see if I can at least begin to clarify some of your misconceptions.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are having a hard time understanding the concepts as written, try looking up the articles on <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simple English Wikipedia<\/a> first. The try to make their articles easier for novices to understand.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no such concept as Dominant Nucleotide Bases. The two strands of the DNA double helix are complementary and antiparallel. Genes can reside on either strand.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are also getting really mixed about recombination via crossing over in meiosis. The chromosomes that are being recombined in the mother are from her parents, so technically the chromosomes that are being recombined are the grandparents chromosomes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same is happening when the father produces gametes. The chromosomes from his parents are swapping pieces of DNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of meiosis, each gamete has a random assortment of 23 chromosomes, either from the father or the mother of the adult male or the father or the mother of the adult female. <\/p>\n\n<p>The 23 can be recombined meaning that the chromosome is part grandma and part grandpa, or it is a grandmother's chromosome that has not recombined or a grandfather's chromosome that has not recombined. Just looking at the possible ways that 23 chromosomes can randomly assort without taking into account recombination to produce a gamete, there are about 8 million combinations. Add recombination and it gives you a huge amount of genetic diversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>So those are the haploid gametes. When fertilization occurs the sperm from the father donates its random assortment of 23 chromosomes and the ovum from the mother has 23 randomly assorted chromosomes of its own. This gives you at total of 46; 23 from the father, made up of a random assortment of chromosomes from his father and mother (or chromosomes recombined by crossing over to be part his mom and part his dad), and 23 from the mother with the same pattern of random assortment and recombination.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, the double helix doesn't dissociate (come apart) during crossing over [NOTE: for those who know, please do not jump on me for not explaining strand invasion here and the need for homologous sequences for crossing over]. One part of a grandparent's chromosome is exchanged for the exact same part of a chromosome from the other grandparent's chromosome, assuming normal cross over events. The alleles (versions) of the genes in that segment may vary, which is why you have a chromosome is part grandmother and part grandfather.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for dominant autosomal genetic traits versus recessive genetic traits. A dominant trait means that a heterozygous child will express the phenotype even though they only have one copy of the dominant allele. If it is a disease, then we say the person is affected. If it is a recessive trait, then the heterozygous child will not express the phenotype, so they are not affected by the disease, but they carry the allele and can pass it on to their children. This person is said to be a carrier. If a person is homozygous for a recessive trait, then they will be affected by the disease and show the phenotype. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for inheritance, you have to draw the punnet squares. This will show you the different patterns and probabilities of inheritance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think that you are getting confused by the idea that you inherit one set of 23 chromosomes from your mother and one set of 23 chromosomes from you father. While this is true, meiosis happens in their reproductive organs before fertilization (for the most part, but the important part happens there and then).<\/p>\n\n<p>The example of the father is easier. He has two sets of chromosomes, one set that he inherited from his mother and one set he inherited from his father. At the beginning of meiosis all 46 chromosomes replicate. They make an exact copy of themselves and are joined at the centromeres. You have 2 sister chromatids on each of those chromosomes. Now the the homologous chromosomes will pair up, so one of the chromatids on the paternal chromosome (say chromosome 4 from Grandfather's set) will join with a non sister chromatid from the maternal chromosome (Grandmother's chromosome 4). So you have four chromatids from chromosome 4 lined up at the metaphase plate. The two non sister chromatids that are joined will recombine when the kinetochores move along the microtubules towards the poles of the spindle. At the end of all of this you have two cells that contain 23 chromosomes, each with a sister chromatid, however the sister chromatids are no longer identical because one of them recombined with the the non sister chromatid of its homologous chromosome. The thing you must remember is that each chromosome assorted independently of the other. For Chromosome 1 the maternal chromosome may have gone to the left cell while the paternal chromosome went to the right. Then for chromosome 2 you might have the maternal chromosome go right and the paternal chromosome go left. And so on and so forth. The number of possible combinations of how you can arrange two sets of 23 chromosomes is 2^23 or about 8 million different combinations.<\/p>\n\n<p>During meiosis II the 23 chromosomes again line up at the metaphase plate and they are attached to the spindle by both sides of their centromere / kinetochore complex. When the migrate the two sister chromatids migrate towards opposite poles. Again it is completely random as to whether the recombined chromatid or the chromatid that did not undergo recombination will migrate to the right or the left. Again, there are 2^23 possible combinations for EACH cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>So you end up with an incredible amount of genetic diversity on how chromosomes are assorted within the gametes. You will still only have four possible outcomes  in the copies of any single gene that you get. You will inherit either your paternal grandfather's copy or your paternal grandmother's copy and you will inherit either your maternal grandmother's copy or your maternal grandfather's copy. That is why if a genetic disease is caused by one gene, it depends on which copies you inherit.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39086,"question_id":39085,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1443309328},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f78498014ce35ba1706c34618bfa425?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19038,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19038/valentin-tihomirov","reputation":1,"display_name":"Valentin Tihomirov"},"score":0,"post_id":39087,"edited":false,"creation_date":1443352492,"comment_id":65339,"body":"You exaggerate the number of questions I have asked.

There is a lot to say, so I am just making a very short overview of different subjects. Get some coffee first, read slowly and don't hesitate to click on the wikipedia links to further your knowledge.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pairs of chromosomes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We all have 46 chromosomes. The chromosomes can be arranged in 23 pairs. By definition the 3rd pair of chromosomes is the 3rd longest pair of chromosomes as you can see on this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">karyotype<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm47g.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm47g.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You'll note that the 23rd pair is the pair of sexual chromosomes but I won't talk about them. Note by the way that species that have chromosomes present in pairs are called diploid. Some species are haploids (not pairs), some are tetraploids (4 chromosomes of the same type together), etc... While the terms \"diploids species\" is often used to refer to mammals for example, it is actually more correct to talk <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">diplontic<\/a> species. Diplontic species, are those species who are diploid most of the time and haploid only for a short period. Our ovules and spermatozoids are indeed haploids.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pairs of chromatids<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Chromosome are more-or-less X-shaped. Each \"vertical line\" of the <code>X<\/code> is a double stranded (double helix) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid\" rel=\"nofollow\">chromatids<\/a>. Two chromatids of the same chromosome are called sister chromatids. Two chromosomes of the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. Note that chromosomes don't always look as they are represented here, it depends on the phase during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">life cycle of the cell<\/a> but this is a story for another time. As you said, one chromatid is made of two strands that are \"anti-parallel\". The point of the junction in the center (although it is note always in the center as you can see) of the X-shape is called the centromere.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inheritence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In a pair of chromosomes, one chromosome is inherited by the father, the other one by the mother. Therefore we receive exactly the same amount of genetic information from each parent (but see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24269/does-one-parent-transmit-more-dna-to-the-offspring-than-the-other-one\">this post<\/a>). The egg actually receive 2 single chromatids (one from the ovule and one from the spermatozoid). At some stage of the life cycle each chromatid duplicate to make those X-shaped chromosomes. Therefore, two sister chromatids are exactly (except exceptions!) identical. However, because one chromosome come from the father and the other one from the mother, two homologous chromosomes are not exactly identical. Note that mutations occur during replication of DNA (especially during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">meiosis<\/a>). Note also that at the moment of producing our gametes (=spermatozoids and ovules), chromatids from different chromosomes (within the same pair) can exchange DNA. This process is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover\" rel=\"nofollow\">crossing-over<\/a>. Here is a schema of this process<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WEVz.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WEVz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crossover<\/a> is the process by which two chromatids from different homologous chromosomes exchange their DNA. Chromatids do not merge into one (as suggested in your below comment). Look at the above picture. Top left are the two homologous chromosomes. Top right are the two homologous chromosomes after crossover (a little pink piece is now attached to a blue chromatid and vice-versa). In the bottom are the four resulting gametes (the 4 independent chromatids) after meiosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>While crossover refers to the mechanism, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination\" rel=\"nofollow\">recombination<\/a> refers to the statistical association between two loci. On the above picture there are two loci represented and both are heterozygotes (see below for definition) as at one locus are the alleles <code>aA<\/code> and at the other locus are the alleles <code>bB<\/code>. Of course, on the sister chromatids both alleles are the same given that the two chromatids are just copy of one another where one comes from one parent. Therefore, <code>a<\/code> is always with <code>b<\/code> and <code>A<\/code> is always with <code>B<\/code> on the same chromatids. In the absence of crossover, we say that they segregate non-independently. If the offspring get <code>A<\/code>, (s)he will necessarily get <code>B<\/code> as well. However, if crossover can occur in between the two loci, then some gametes can carry <code>a<\/code> and <code>B<\/code> and some others can carry <code>A<\/code> and <code>b<\/code>. The statistical association between two locus is referred to as recombination. the recombination rate between two loci indicates the rate with which a crossover will occur between these two loci.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>DNA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>When talking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">DNA<\/a>, we usually refer to one double helix (one chromatid). DNA, is made of different chemical compounds including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide\" rel=\"nofollow\">nucleotides<\/a>. There are 4 types of nucleotides that we are reffering to by the first letter of their names, A, T, C and G. Every time there's a T on one strand there is a A, in the other strand (and vice-versa). Every time there's a G on one strand there is a C, in the other strand (and vice-versa). In consequence one strand is some kind of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)\" rel=\"nofollow\">negative (photography)<\/a> of the other strand.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IGivB.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IGivB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>From gene to protein<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can refer to a position on a chromosome as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">locus<\/a>. At different loci are different types of sequences. Without going into the details, a gene is a type of sequence that is used to make a protein. In order to make a protein from a gene, the double helix has to open up over a short region, some proteins come, read the DNA and make up an RNA out of it. The RNA is some kind of negative of the DNA strand that has been read (except that the Ts are replaced by Us). From the RNA some other mechanism (ribosomes; ribosomes are actually made of other RNAs but this is also a story for another time) make a protein our of the RNA. Here is an extremely simplified schema of this process.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mqkS5.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mqkS5.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Effects of the genotype on the phenotype<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As I said above, there are some differences between homologous chromosomes. Consider for example that in a population, at a given locus (let's assume this locus correspond to a gene for simplicity) different chromosomes carry different variants. These variants are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele\" rel=\"nofollow\">alleles<\/a>. The words recessivity, additivity or dominance refer to the relationship between two different alleles at the same locus in terms of how the two alleles affect the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotype<\/a>. Referring from wikipedia <code>A phenotype [..] is the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior [..]<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Recessivity, additivity and dominance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Let's call one allele <code>A<\/code>and the other allele <code>a<\/code>. Given that one individual has two chromosomes, this individual at the locus under consideration can be either <code>aa<\/code>, <code>aA<\/code>, <code>Aa<\/code> or <code>AA<\/code>. The difference between <code>aA<\/code> and <code>Aa<\/code> is that in one case the <code>A<\/code> allele comes from the mother while in the other case it comes from the father. It essentially makes no difference, so let's just call these two types <code>aA<\/code>. <code>a<\/code> and <code>A<\/code> are said additive if the phenotype <code>aA<\/code> is the average phenotypes between the phenotype of <code>aa<\/code> and <code>AA<\/code>. If the phenotype <code>aA<\/code> is closer to the phenotype <code>AA<\/code> than tow the phenotype <code>aa<\/code>, then <code>A<\/code> is said to be partially dominant and <code>a<\/code> is partially recessive (or vice-verse for the opposite scenario). In the extreme case where the phenotype of <code>aA<\/code> is exactly like the phenotype of <code>AA<\/code>, then <code>A<\/code> is said to be dominant and <code>a<\/code> is recessive (or vice-verse for the opposite scenario). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdominance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Overdominance<\/a> is a third type of relationship where the phenotype of <code>aA<\/code> lies outside the range of phenotypes of <code>aa<\/code> and <code>AA<\/code>. Such as for example individuals having both <code>aa<\/code> and <code>AA<\/code> genotypes are small while individuals being <code>aA<\/code> are big. Btw, <code>AA<\/code> and <code>aa<\/code> individuals are said to be homozygous while <code>aA<\/code> are said to be heterozygous regardless of the functional relationship between the two alleles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider for example a disease that is expressed only in the <code>aa<\/code> genotypes. In such case <code>a<\/code> is recessive. If two <code>AA<\/code> individuals mate together there is no risque for the child to carry the disease. If one <code>aA<\/code> individuals mate with a <code>AA<\/code> individual the child is either <code>aA<\/code> (with probability 0.5) or <code>AA<\/code> (with probability 0.5). If two <code>aA<\/code> individuals <code>aA<\/code> mate together, than a child is <code>aA<\/code> (with probability 0.5), <code>AA<\/code> (with probability 0.25) or <code>aa<\/code> (with probability 0.25). In other words, if two heterozygotes individuals mate together, they have a probability 0.25 that a given child will carry the disease if the disease is recessive. This probability reaches 0.75 if the disease is dominant (but the two heterozygote parents would both express the disease as well).<\/p>\n","answer_id":39087,"question_id":39085,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1443376734}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39085/how-do-two-parents-recessive-and-dominant-genes-and-two-complimentary-nucleotid","last_activity_date":1443376734,"creation_date":1443289391,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do two parents, recessive and dominant genes and two complimentary nucleotides end up in one DNA?","body":"<p>In the basic school, I was taught that half of genome is received from father and another half comes from mother in the form of double-helix DNA, whose first helix consists of dominant nucleotide bases and second helix is a kinda inverted copy of the first helix.

This in turn keeps endothelial cells healthy so that they maintain a tight cell layer in order to protect the underlying tissue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>As part of the mechanical defenses against pathogens, endothelial cells are ciliated and they rhythmically sweep mucus from the sinuses and nasal cavity mainly into your esophagus and digestive system, but can also move mucus into your nose. Most of the time we aren't even aware this clearance of mucus is happening and it travels down our esophagus into our stomach's and intestines where it can be excreted from the body. This is the case when you do not have an infection and your mucus is not viscous.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you have an infection the inflammatory response is triggered by cytokines from macrophages. Those cytokines induce cells in the area to do many things. One is to increase mucus production. This may cause endothelial cells in your nostrils and nasal cavity and sinuses to secrete more mucus as well, and this will be swept away through your nose, where you will notice it as a runny nose. <\/p>\n\n<p>Usually your nose is runnier with rhinovirus infections or with allergens than it is when you have a bacterial infection where mucous tends to be thicker and more viscous. The ciliated endothelial cells have an easier time moving the thinner mucous of a viral infection or allergy than the thicker mucus of a bacterial infection, so you notice a runny nose more when you have a cold or hay fever.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in short, the biological purpose of a runny nose is that it is part of the immune response to clear pathogens away and protect your uninfected endothelial cells from being infected. It also clears out much of the debris and inflammatory proteins that are found at the site of the infection so that they do not remain in the area to further inflame tissue that is trying to heal. When you have allergies your immune system reacts inappropriately to a benign substance, and if the allergen finds its way into your nasal cavity, it will generate rhinitis and cause your nose to run.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39091,"question_id":39090,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1443326800}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39090/what-is-the-point-of-a-runny-nose-during-a-cold","last_activity_date":1443326800,"creation_date":1443309978,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the point of a runny nose during a cold?","body":"<p>What is the biological purpose of having a runny nose during a cold?<\/p>\n\n<p>Note, this is a different question than \"<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1573/what-causes-a-stuffy-or-runny-nose-when-you-have-a-cold\">What causes a runny nose<\/a>\" and other similar questions.

Most of the DNA is nuclear DNA. As it's name indicates, nuclear DNA is found in the nucleus. The cytoplasmic DNA is found in the cytoplasm, that is, outside of the nucleus. More specifically, in all eukaryotes, cytoplasmic DNA can be found in the mitochondrion. In plants (which are eukaryotes), you can find cytoplasmic DNA in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion\" rel=\"nofollow\">mitochondrion<\/a> and in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastid\" rel=\"nofollow\">plastids<\/a> (including the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast\" rel=\"nofollow\">chloroplasts<\/a> (plastids active in photosynthesis)).

It also assumes that we are talking about autosomes (non-sexual chromosomes, see below for sexual chromosomes). These assumptions hold for humans for example. Note that the diploid phase is much longer in human than the haploid phase (spermatozoid, ovule). We say that humans are diplontic. Some species are haplontic (longer haploid phase) and some are haplo-diplontic. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">life-cycle<\/a> for more info.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short: Inheritance of nuclear genes is bi-parental, each offspring necessarily carry one copy of a given gene from his/her father and the other copy from his/her mother.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: there are some exceptions to this perfect bi-parental transmission (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict#Segregation_distortion\" rel=\"nofollow\">segregation distorter and intra-genomic conflict<\/a>). Also, have a look to the short section on sexual chromosomes below.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inheritance of Cytoplasmic Genes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are many exceptions to what I am about to write...<\/p>\n\n<p>Globally speaking, offspring inherit cytoplasmic DNA for their mothers only. That means that your mitochondrion are those of your mother only. Therefore, mothers transmit slightly more genes than fathers because of the concern of cytoplasmic genes.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To complete the picture...<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inheritance of Sexual Chromosomes (Nuclear DNA)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Not all sexual species have sexual chromosomes but some do. In these species, it is not rare that one of the two sexual chromosomes is shorter than the other (In mammals, the $Y$ chromosome is shorter than the $X$ chromosome). In such case, the male transmit slightly less DNA to their male offspring than to their female offsrping. Also, in such case, fathers transmit less DNA to their male offspring than do mothers but males transmit as much DNA to their female offspring than do mothers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The evolution of sexual chromosomes is a very interesting subject as well and you will find tons of information on this website or on different sites.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Non-genetic inheritance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Nutrient in eggs<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Not only genes are transmitted. Parents also transmit proteins and nutrients in the egg. Females transmit more nutrients to their offspring than males.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Epigenetic<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Not only genes are transmitted. Parents also transmit modification on the DNA that are not modifications in the DNA sequence per se. These modifications are called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">epigenetic<\/a> modifications\". Not all species can produce epigenetic modifications. In species who can transmit epigenetic modifications, both males and females can produce them. It is possible that in some species mother have a higher variance in the modifications that they transmit than males (or vice-versa) but I am not aware of such things.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Environment and Cultural transmission<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Not only genes are transmitted. Parents also offer an environment in which the offspring grow. Some species typically feed or protect their offsprings. Depending on the species males or females may have more influence on the environment experienced by the offsprings. Finally, in some species (human, chimps and orca for example) a set of traditions (culture) are transmitted to the offsprings from the parents. And depending on the species the father or the mother may have more influence in the culture transmitted to the offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Length of chromosomes may differ between two randomly sampled individuals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Not all variants between two chromosomes in a population is caused by substitutions of one nucleotide by another. Some variation is due to deletions of nucleotides or insertions of nucelotides. You can even very long piece of DNA who get inserted, duplicated or deleted. Therefore between two given individuals, the exact amount of DNA that is transmitted may also differ only because they happen to have different variants. However, this is not a systematic difference in the quantity of DNA that is transmitted by one sex or another unlike the other cases presented above.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24271,"question_id":24269,"up_vote_count":17,"last_edit_date":1443293751},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nd2B5.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17417,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17417/john-perkins","reputation":100,"display_name":"John Perkins"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1440965701,"creation_date":1440963357,"body":"<p>Certainly in the case of flowering plants a triploid can be created by crossing a diploid by a tetraploid.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case the teraploid parent will contribute twice as much DNA to the offspring than the diploid parent.

Hence, each electrode stimulates a separate frequency band (Fig. 1). By using a microphone and sending the acoustic signal through a filter bank, a number of auditory frequency bands can be obtained equal to the number of electrodes in the implant. After this <a href=\"http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/2006-108websites/group10cochlearimplant/pages/speechprocessor.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">speech processing<\/a> step, the acoustic frequency bands are converted into trains of biphasic pulses.

Also, interactions of nAChRs with other signalling systems, such as those based on stress hormones, GABA, and dopamine, can lead to cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nicotine also has important effects in the brain. Chronic exposure to nicotine induces a homeostatic mechanism that upregulates nAChR expression in the brain to maintain responsiveness to endogenous acetylcholine. This effect partially underlies nicotine addiction (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.01.001\">Penton and Lester, 2009<\/a>). As @Armatus notes, nicotine appears to have some neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/pr.110.003269\">Quik, M., Wonnacott, S., 2011<\/a>) and Alzheimer's (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2741/367\">Mehta et al, 2012<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrc2590\">Schuller, H.M., 2009.<\/a> Is cancer triggered by altered signalling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors?

Secondary health effects are possible, but here is a toxicological profiles. <\/p>\n\n<p>Nicotine is a toxin in large enough quantities and nicotine has an LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of individuals) of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_poisoning#Toxicology\">0.5-1 mg Nicotine / kg of body weight<\/a>.  So even a small spill on your skin of the chemical can be life threatening, but for smokers the nicotine itself is not dangerous. <\/p>\n\n<p>Individuals who smoke intake about 1 mg per cigarette smoked.  So a small adult (110 lbs) can smoke 25 cigarettes in a short period of time (or all at once!) and just barely get to the bottom end of that limit.  Nicotine is water soluble and clears out through the urine at a fast rate though - half of the nicotine from a cigarette is cleared from  your system within 2 hours, which means that 4-5 pack a day smokers are not really killing themselves (from nicotine).  <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, children are about 5-10 times more sensitive than adults, so even 5-6 cigarettes in an hour can be toxic.  That's quite a bit of smoking though. <\/p>\n\n<p>Not all animals have the same relationship to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as humans do.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide#Neonicotinoids\">Nicotine is toxic to insects and will kill an insect in a matter of minutes or hours<\/a>. Rats are about 50x less sensitive than people.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think its comparable to the question of whether caffeine is harmful to people.  In the amount we consume it, sometimes up to grams a day, there is no obvious common side effect, but you figure that decades later it will show up as a problem - a difficult connection to prove.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5368,"question_id":5361,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1354382888},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10100702004030494/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":19026,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19026/morgan-maiolie","reputation":11,"display_name":"Morgan Maiolie"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1443201179,"creation_date":1443201179,"body":"<p>When exploring whether nicotine is toxic to humans, the discussion isn't complete without the inclusion of non-adult humans / humans-in-development.

It takes a number of milliseconds for the electrical impulse to travel from the sinoatrial (SA) node to the atrioventricular (AV) node, down the His bundle, and finally to the Purkinje fibers in the ventricles. It takes this long because the movement of charge is caused by ions in the cells physically moving. That change in charge is conducted (via normal electrical conduction, such as you see in a wire) through the tissue and muscle to the electrodes on the wrists--this conduction is effectively instantaneous (in this case, it's electrons \"pushing\" each other, not ions moving within cells as in the case of the heart's electrical system). <a href=\"http://en.ecgpedia.org/wiki/Basics\" rel=\"nofollow\">ECGpedia<\/a> has some good background on this.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/ConductionsystemoftheheartwithouttheHeart-en.svg/400px-ConductionsystemoftheheartwithouttheHeart-en.svg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/ConductionsystemoftheheartwithouttheHeart-en.svg/400px-ConductionsystemoftheheartwithouttheHeart-en.svg.png\" alt=\"Conduction system of the heart\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The ECG system takes the voltage from your right wrist (call this V<sub>RA<\/sub>), and subtracts it from the voltage at your left wrist (call this V<sub>LA<\/sub>), so that V<sub>lead I<\/sub> = V<sub>LA<\/sub> - V<sub>RA<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/22gST.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/22gST.png\" alt=\"ECG Limb Lead Diagram\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, the signal you're seeing is produced by the heart's conduction system, not the muscles in your wrists.

These are filled in by Klenow DNA polymerase, adding biotin-dCTP to both ends of each fragment. Then the fragments are ligated under conditions (ie low DNA concentration) such that ligation between non-crosslinked DNA is less likely. This reduced ligation efficiency (which is already lessened by the use of blunt end fragments) means that all crosslinked fragments may not be ligated, which I imagine is what they are showing in Image 2.

Thus, any free DNA ends which have not been ligated will be trimmed, removing the biotin.

I say mostly because some of these so-called dangling ends will still retain biotin, but these can be distinguished during mapping (see image below). <\/p>\n\n<p>As for self circles: because they have been ligated, they will contain biotin and be pulled down with the crosslinked DNA.

For instance:<\/p>\n\n<p>Fixation rates for neutral alleles are affected by changes in population size, given a constant mutation rate. In general, fixation rates are lower in growing populations (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374318/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waxman 2012<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>This makes instinctive sense if you consider the single-generation fixation probability of a neutral allele which only exists at all but one copy in the population, i.e., the common allele (A) exists at 2N(t)-1 copies, whereas the less common allele (a) exists at 1 copy. To simplify, let's assume complete random mating. Under negative population growth (say N(t+1) = 0.9N(t)), there will be 0.9*(2N) places that the rare allele could possibly exist at t+1, and it has a 1/(2*N(t)) chance of filling each of them. Under positive population growth (say, N(t+1) = 1.1*N(t)), the rare allele could potentially occupy 1.1*(2N) places at t+1, but still has 1/(2*N(t)) chance of filling each of them. It is clear in this case that A has a reduced generation-wise likelihood of fixation under positive population growth than under negative population growth, simply because the rare allele has an increased chance of doggedly persisting. The finding applies to any allele near fixation.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I have understood <a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/155/3/1415.full#T2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kim and Stephan (2000)<\/a> correctly, then overall fixation rates are also reduced by background selection. The main mechanism for this is that background selection purges linked neutral alleles, decreasing overall heterozygosity and thereby reducing the chance that a new, rare allele will become established.

This is just my interpretation of <a href=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~gelkoura/noback/scapaper03.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> paper, which says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The human hand has 27 degrees of freedom: 4 in each finger, 3 for extension and flexion and one for abduction and adduction; the thumb is more complicated and has 5 DOF, leaving 6 DOF for the rotation and translation of the wrist. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>To accurately model the hand, a complete model of the muscles, tendons, bones and a neurological control structure is necessary. The dynamics of such a complex model are still poorly understood, forcing the use of simplified models. Current models are too simplified for our purpose so we turn to recent work from the medical community to motivate assumptions used in a new model that we propose here. We use a 27 DOF model of the hand with the following sim- plifying assumptions:\n  1. The thumb is independent of the other fingers.\n  2. Adduction/abductionofthefingerjointsareindependent.\n  3. Motion frequency does not affect joint interdependence.\n  4. Both hands have the same interdependence model.\n  5. The posture of the wrist and the rest of the arm do not\n  affect the underlying interdependence structure.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this implies to me that there are different models of the hand with different assumptions that use a different number of degrees of freedom. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, take a look at this hand:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJxsI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>[<a href=\"http://visual.merriam-webster.com/human-being/anatomy/skeleton/hand.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a>]<\/p>\n\n<p>And now, follow along with your own hand!<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>finger (4 DOF)<\/strong>: each finger has 2 interphalangeal joints between the distal, middle and proximal phalanges that allow for flexion/extension (2 DOF); each finger also has a metacarpophalangeal joint between the proximal phalanx and the metacarpal that allows for flexion/extension as well as abduction/adduction (2 DOF)<\/li>\n<li><strong>thumb (5 DOF)<\/strong>: an interphalangeal joint between the distal and proximal phalanges allowing flexion/extension (1 DOF); a metacarpophalangeal joint between the proximal phalanx and metacarpal allowing flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (2 DOF); a carpometacarpal joint between the metacarpal and trapezium allowing flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (2 DOF)<\/li>\n<li><strong>wrist (6 DOF)<\/strong>: between the carpals and radius allowing flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and supination/pronation (3 DOF); I think when the authors refer to translation of the wrist, they are simply saying that hand can be moved in all planes of 3D space (ie up/down, side to side, forward/backward - 3 DOF)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Since we have 4 fingers, they give 16 DOF. Adding the 5 DOF of the thumb and 6 of the wrist, we get 27. Please nobody question my reasoning.
