So in this case you can see that itching, like many irritations are linked to the immune system which is highly variable from one individual to another, as such it is still a bit of a black box.<br>\nThe histamine pathway is well studied and histamine stimulates an ion channel protein in nerve cells called TRPV1, which is also known as the capsaicin receptor, which means it is also related to sensing heat.  This explains why itching can be relieved (temporarily) by exposing the skin to water that is as hot as the patient can stand without burning them.  This is one of the ways pain and itching are highly intertwined. <\/p>\n\n<p>Still, not all itching is stimulated by histamine release; that isn't the whole story.  Antihistamine allergy pills don't help itching.  Other nerve channel proteins can be activated to stimulate itching.  One example found in an itchy mutant strain of mice is TRPA1, and maybe the G protein coupled receptor, Gastrin Releasing Protein Receptor (GRPR). Its hard to imagine that there will not be more mechanisms discovered later.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Mediated both by immune systems and nerve cells, which literally have a mind of their own and whose signal processing is highly individualized and sensitive to local conditions in the body make itching a fairly mysterious phenomenon.

In fact, protein-coding genes only constitute a tiny part \u2013 less than 2% \u2013 of the whole DNA. There are of course many other genes which aren\u2019t protein coding: there are genes for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA\">ribosomal RNA<\/a> and we find more and more genes which code for small RNAs, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRNA\">tRNA<\/a>. But even if we count all those genes we won\u2019t come above maybe 10% of the total DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the DNA is instead devoted to the regulation of gene expression, most importantly via the binding of transcription factors (but the picture is much more complex than that). With the conclusion of the <a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/\">ENCODE project<\/a>, a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/encode/\">whole slew of papers<\/a> were published which show that in fact most of the DNA is actively implicated in the binding of various factors (although it\u2019s not known how much of that actually contributed to the cell\u2019s fitness).<\/p>\n\n<p>But I\u2019ve hijacked your question a bit here. So let\u2019s come back to what you\u2019re actually interested in:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about higher levels, such as organelles, cells, tissue, organs?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no known mechanism (beyond the already mentioned regulation) which would encode such information in the DNA. Excluding its existence categorically may be hard but given that we haven\u2019t found <em>any<\/em> machinery which would be necessary to read such information, we can be pretty confident that it doesn\u2019t exist.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If not, what guides those levels of structure?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The higher levels of organisation are to all appearances emergent. That is, they are a <em>consequence<\/em> of the lower level organisation. For instance, take the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton\">cytoskeleton<\/a> which carries much of the cell\u2019s physical structure. It is composed of different protein complexes which form spontaneously through assembly of globular proteins (such as actin). The are several ways in which the process can be guided but strikingly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin#Formation_of_thin_filament\">it\u2019s largely stochastic<\/a> \u2013 i.e. mostly unguided, and it still succeeds in building a stable skeleton, simply by virtue of molecular properties encoded in the proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think this is a common theme of cell organisation: the elementary building blocks are encoded by the DNA, and their abundance is tightly regulated. Everything else, i.e. higher-level organisation \u2013 follows from that: abundance and localisation of the right proteins.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As for differentation into different types of cells, and organization into tissue and organs: the information and control systems for that are currently unknown.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, much <em>is<\/em> known here, and it goes back to regulation on the level of DNA: we know that genes are differentially expressed depending on the cell type and stage of development (and the stage in the cell cycle). This regulation is highly complex and decoding it is a slow process. Nevertheless, the factors involved here are decoded one by one.

But this is also a result of our lifestyle, depending on huge cattle herds, as cattle can be cross-infected with human TB. In the west we have succeded to cut human infections by controlling cattle infection with human TB. Still, cattle can get bovine TB, and this may be economically disastrous. One of the pools of the infection is the badger population which can get bovine TB too and spread bacteria with their urine. It is unclear if protozoa may be an even more important pool. It is likewise unclear if culling of badgers would be successful for cattle TB control; the government bases its decision on a long-term study of regions where culling has happened. Alternative approaches include vaccination (which only affects uninfected animals), different cattle grazing regimes, habitat manipulations and badger latrine management. Physical exclusion of badgers from farm buildings is suggested as the simplest, and potentially most effective, method of reducing contact and opportunities for disease transmission between badgers and cattle. The government expert opinion clearly concluded that without such additional measures, culling won't be successful in reducing cattle TB.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3620,"question_id":3618,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1348137094}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3618/does-culling-badgers-restrict-the-spread-of-bovine-tuberculosis","last_activity_date":1348137094,"creation_date":1348123882,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does culling badgers restrict the spread of bovine tuberculosis?","body":"<p>The British government has announced that it plans a large-scale badger cull which they argue are implicated in the spread of <em>Mycobacterium bovis<\/em> - so-called bovine tuberculosis.

This happens continuously with the creation of new memories and experiences (neurons are even created just to mark time passing - even if no memories are stored alongside - so that a perception of 10mins and 10secs is possible, even if nothing memorable happens). As new clusters of neurons are generated, they gradually differentiate and mature to become fully functional, and in this way time and memory are interlinked, and experiences are clustered together [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1707\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>].<\/p>\n\n<p>In a human study where individuals were asked to recall whether news events occurred within 1 week of each other (some related, some not), same-week and separation judgements were more far more accurate for related events. Unrelated events were essentially guesses, whereas deductions could be made about related events. [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/MC.38.8.1122\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>].

Melatonin participates in various functions of the body, among which its immunomodulatory role has assumed considerable significance in recent years. Melatonin has been shown to be involved in the regulation of both cellular and humoral immunity. Melatonin not only stimulates the production of natural killer cells, monocytes and leukocytes, but also alters the balance of T helper (Th)-1 and Th-2 cells mainly towards Th-1 responses and increas- es the production of relevant cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12 and interferon-&gamma;. The regulatory function of melatonin on immune mechanisms is seasonally dependent. This fact may in part account for the cyclic pattern of symptom expression shown by certain infectious diseases, which become more pronounced at particular times of the year. Moreover, melatonin-induced seasonal changes in immune function have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorder and rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical significance of the seasonally changing immunomodulatory role of melatonin is discussed in this review.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":3608,"question_id":3602,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3602/are-there-yearly-variations-in-hiomt-hydroxyindole-o-methyltransferase-availab","last_activity_date":1348078579,"creation_date":1348061856,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there yearly variations in HIOMT (HydroxyIndole-O-MethylTransferase) availability?","body":"<p>I'm reading a booklet on melatonin published in 1996, titled \"Melatonin and the Biological Clock\".

The bats were tracked throughout the night with a point taken at approximately 10 minute intervals. The bats were tracked over consecutive nights until an asymptote in their space use was reached. So now I have point patterns for each bat that pretty much covers the entirety of their space use at that period. <\/p>\n\n<p>When the data is displayed visually there is a clear pattern of the bats that were tracked during the flowering period moving into the aggregations of the plant however they also spend a lot of time foraging around their roost sites. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have simulated the point pattern of each bat 999 times by randomly shifting and rotating the points within the study window (the internal structure of the observed pattern was maintained in the simulations to account for autocorrelation). I then did randomisation tests to see if the average distance to the nearest plant aggregation for the observed data is within the lower 5% of the distribution of the averages for the simulated point patterns. However because the majority of the points collected are highly associated with the roosts the average distance is primarily effected by the position of the roost in relation to any of the plant aggregations.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been thinking of ways to disentangle the association with roosts and the association with the plant. <\/p>\n\n<p>First I was thought about putting a buffer around the roosts and removing the points falling within these buffers from the analysis. The problem is deciding on a buffer. In the other areas I have been using a buffer equal to the circular error probable of the radio tracking error but placing this around the roost will only incorporate the points where the bat was actually inside the roost not foraging around it. All the bats have different foraging patterns around their roosts and I can't see how to assign a buffer distance that is not completely arbitrary.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second method we have been looking into is taking out the points that are more closely associated (closer in distance) with the roost than the nearest plant aggregation and then running the randomisation to look at the association of the remaining points to the plant. I want to get an idea of whether or not removing the association with the roosts in this way will potentially bias the analysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or further suggestions?!<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!    <\/p>\n","question_id":3594,"tags":["zoology","ecology","experimental-design"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"off topic","is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0f914780b79358ef988a7ba6208746b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":224,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/224/hippietrail","reputation":212,"display_name":"hippietrail"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0f914780b79358ef988a7ba6208746b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":224,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/224/hippietrail","reputation":212,"display_name":"hippietrail"},"score":0,"post_id":3460,"edited":false,"creation_date":1347014559,"comment_id":5224,"body":"Would anyone like to add <code>junk-dna<\/code> and/or <code>noncoding-dna<\/code> (or should that be <code>non-coding-dna<\/code> tags?

However not all stretches of DNA are actually transcribed into mRNA for translation into proteins. For this to happen the stretch of DNA requires (DNA-encoded) elements to promote and regulate the transcription and translation processes, and this, very broadly, is what defines a gene: a segment of DNA which has the required components to direct the synthesis of a protein (or in some cases an RNA that will not be translated into a protein). The segments of DNA that correspond to mRNA for proteins and to other RNA molecules are referred to as coding sequences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, I've omitted lots of details here: some genes encode RNA molecules, such as ribosomal RNAs, which are not translated into proteins; eukaryotic genes include stretches of sequence (called introns) that are spliced out of the transcript before the mRNA>protein step.

Fortunately we are also have a reasonable intrinsic resistance to cold and flu and I think most infections do not result in symptoms.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Viruses often only infect some parts of the body.  Venerial diseases are a classic example of this where only contact of genitalia might cause transmission. Its probable that Hantavirus is not excreted through the sweat glands or in saliva.  If it did it would certainly be a more devastating disease.   It may also only be serious when the virus is introduced into the lungs, which may make transmission difficult. <\/p>\n\n<p>For Hantavirus human to human transmission looks possible as observed by <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297989765\" rel=\"nofollow\">these folks<\/a>. Even so, transmission is still so rare that there is no accounting for it in public health policy.  (they might also have been mistaken!).   Its possible that the virus requires transmission from a mouse to be virulent in humans. Its possible that the human transmission mechanism is so improbable (ingestion of faeces of infected human for instance) that you just dont' see it happening with the few cases of Hantavirus infection we have on the books. <\/p>\n","answer_id":3577,"question_id":3420,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3420/why-are-some-viruses-not-communicable-person-to-person","last_activity_date":1347839548,"creation_date":1346553498,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why are some viruses not communicable person-to-person?","body":"<p>Below are two quotes from the CDC about Hantavirus:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Researchers believe that people may be able to get the virus if they\n  touch something that has been contaminated with rodent urine,\n  droppings, or saliva, and then touch their nose or mouth.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You cannot get the virus from touching or kissing a person who has HPS.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is hard to believe.

As the guy who brought up LTP/LTD in the question you referenced, I thought I would weigh in.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is the traditional definition of LTP/LTD as an increased/decreased synaptic efficacy at a single synapse or in a single cell. As you've noted, this is unlikely to be the only phenomena underlying memory and sometimes it's hard to see how some of these mechanisms can result in memory on behavioral timescales.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me propose, therefore, that the term <strong>long-term plasticity<\/strong> is more relevant these days, as it can refer to a variety of mechanisms that relate to the ability of the nervous system to change in stable ways over time. Physiological mechanisms involving changes in protein expression include <em>traditional LTP/LTD at single synapses<\/em>, but also <em>homeostatic plasticity<\/em> and <em>long-term changes in intrinsic excitability<\/em> where the tendency of the cell to fire changes independent of changes in synaptic weighting. Some structural mechanisms include the growth of new synapses, new spines, and new neurons--<em>synaptogenesis<\/em>, <em>spinogenesis<\/em>, and <em>neurogenesis<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the end, it is all of these mechanisms (and probably more) at play. Note, for instance, that the plasticity may move through structural changes in the system. This means that the lifetime of LTP in one cell or at one synapse does not necessarily have to be the same as the lifetime of the memory itself. All that said, I think all plasticity mechanisms ultimately reduce down to a change in the ability of an input to elicit an action potential somewhere in the brain (known as <em>EPSP-spike coupling<\/em>).

But obviously, one cannot\n  model millions of years of evolution in a few weeks or months.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>So how\n  might such studies be conducted? One option might be to look back in\n  time.

Proof of\n  principle for this approach has already been demonstrated on several\n  NF proteins[69\u201375]. Similar studies could recreate plausible ancestors\n  for various flagellar components (for example, the common ancestor of\n  flagellins and HAP3 proteins).

They start meiosis during prenatal development, are arrested in diplotene stage of the first meiotic division, and then a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), just before ovulation, makes them resume. But they are arrested again in the last phase, and only after conception do they finish meiosis.

However, both the article quoted and the one in the link are relevant to the question.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Alzheimer's Disease<\/em> : In a nutshell, AD is the most common form of dementia. Although the exact cause is still under investigation, several genes have been implicated in the development of AD. One of the things you see in the brain with disease progression is <em>beta amyloid<\/em> plaque deposition which <a href=\"http://marjanlovsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Red-light-and-green-tea-a-strange-brew-that-may-have-the-answer-to-Alzheimers-22.gif\">disrupts brain activity<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Brain Activity<\/em> : While the brain consumes around 20% of our body's energy at a baseline, an increase in brain activity only increases this consumption by around 5%. Hans Berger, the first to record an EEG stated that \"<em>mental work, as I explained elsewhere, adds only a small increment to the cortical work which is going on continuously and not only in the waking state<\/em>\".(2)<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are a few 'intrinsic' networks or regions that perform functions such as \"information processing for interpreting, responding to and predicting environmental demands\". One of the areas active in this state of the brain is referred to as the 'default mode network' (DMN). It's thought that DMN is the main target of the amyloid plaques responsible for Alzheimer's Disease.(2)<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are other <em>multimodal regions<\/em> of the brain that perform processing of various types of information. It's now suggested that <em>\"regions vulnerable to Ab deposition do not simply involve the DMN, but rather comprise multimodal brain regions that are highly interconnected, plastic, and capable of rapid ATP generation\"<\/em>(1).<\/p>\n\n<p>So it's a variation of activity in these particular areas - not all - that are implicated with Alzheimer's Disease. When you are performing a task, activity in these areas diminish.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Why keep the brain intentionally active<\/em> : The reason for the hypothesis that actively engaging in challenging activity may reduce the risk of AD is that individuals with a high <em>cognitive reserve<\/em> have been shown to cope with the pathological changes such as beta amyloid deposition better. Cognitive reserve has been linked to a bunch of factors including \"<em>education, occupation, socioeconomic status, social networks and lifelong participation in cognitive and physical activity<\/em>\" and reflects \"<em>lifelong patterns of behaviors, endogenous factors (including genetics) and exposure to environmental factors<\/em>\"(1). <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, it's suggested that perhaps higher cognitive reserve increases <em>neuronal efficiency<\/em> which has been shown to reduce plaque deposition.(1).<\/p>\n\n<p>So InquilineKea's question and jp89's answer aren't really contradictory.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>August, et al. <em>Lifespan brain activity, β-amyloid, and Alzheimer's disease<\/em>.\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences. 2011. 15(11):520-526.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Raiche. <em>Two views of the brain<\/em>.\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences. 2010. 14(4):180-190.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hafkemeijer, et al. <em>Imaging the default mode network in aging and dementia<\/em>.\nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease. 2012. 1822(3):431-441.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 16th Ed.

It can come back with sequences that are so divergent that they are probably not really related (personal experience).  <\/p>\n\n<p>A classic example of this is hexokinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates sugars - which shows up in single cell eukaryotes and all animals.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexokinase#Variation\">When the structure of actin was solved, it proved to have the same core fold as hexokinase.<\/a>  Actin is one of the most venerable proteins known in eurkaryotes, so this is now called the actin fold.  None of the software mentioned above would detect this relationship. (I just verified this with psiblast). <\/p>\n\n<p>Its probably not true all the time, but it probably happens a lot that sequences with the same protein fold are so different that they cannot be detected by any of these means.

When they create crosses of the sir2.1 OE strain with wildtype, you can see the Outcross, which is verified to have a high level of sir2 expressed no longer has an extraordinary lifespan.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This can be seen in Figure 1.  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7365/fig_tab/nature10296_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7365/fig_tab/nature10296_F1.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So this paper is now asking, if sir2 levels do not convey the information that creates an extended lifespan, then what does?  It must be some modulation of some protein that sir2 affects.

Although the dSir(EP2300) / + construct (drosophila sir2) with a wild type gene promoter did not live quite as long as dSir2(EP2300) with a fancy promoter (dSir2(EP2300) / tub-GAL4), the promoter construct (tub-GAL4/+) alone also had just as long a lifespan.

That role mostly consists of taking used neurotransmitters and recycling them such as in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate-glutamine_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">glutamate-glutamine cycle<\/a>.  As Preece suggested, glial cells are a heterogenous group, and with a general marker like GFAP you could very well be observing two different types of glial cell, one with a uniform presentation and one specifically in the central retina.<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, the most familiar type of glial cell in the retina is the Muller glial cell.

You could come up with reasons either of those might be important in the central retina, but for my money the arguments are all pretty hypothetical: \"the central retina is more active and therefore has a higher requirement for removing neurotransmitter\" or \"the central retina needs to be protected from potential damage more than the peripheral\".<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing I think we have a good basis to rule out is that it's the optic nerve.  From a retinal point of view, you refer to the point where the optic nerve passes through the rest of the retina as the optic nerve head or optic disc.  Axons from ganglion cells all across the retina stretch out from their soma toward this single point.  By the time they reach the optic nerve, the vast majority of axons are far from their axon hillock.  That means that they're being propagated from one node of Ranvier to the next.

This robot would have to examine each individual cell and destroy it based on what you could sense about the surface properties.  Identifying cancer cells on the basis of the proteins and glycosyl (carbohydrate) molecules on the cell surface is not embodied in a reliable way in a touch sensor.

Cancer cells don't have an obvious sign they are <em>always<\/em> holding out saying 'im cancer'...<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is the structure of tumors.

But let's start from the beginning.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, the reason for color deficiency can be not only lack (rare) or impairment (more often) of certain types of color-perceiving cells (cones) in retina, but also <a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/2C.html\">brain injures<\/a>: the central color blindness can develop after head trauma or as a result of some neurodegenerative deceases, like Parkinson's decease. In case of brain origin of the color blindness it is usually the complete color blindness (no color is percieved), whereas congenical primary color blindness (receptor-based) is usually just the unability to distinguish one or two colors, whereas the rest can be more or less separated.<\/p>\n\n<p>I searched Pubmed for the literature on the topic and found <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19276119\">a recent PNAS paper<\/a> about the simulation of primary and secondary visual cortex on humans using intracranial electrodes. As they describe their results (bold font by me):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When percepts were elicited from late areas, subjects reported that\n  they were simple shapes and <strong>colors<\/strong>....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But the paper investigated only healthy humans, no color impaired subjects were used for the tests, so cannot conclude from here whether we can elicit the perception of the color the person is incapable to see with the eyes using these stimulations.<\/p>\n\n<p>I took this paper as the starting point and did some reference research, looking for the paper referenced there and for newer publications referencing this one: PNAS is one of the top journals in this area with very high impact factor and if there were a publication about brain stimulation and color blindness I would have definitely identified it.<\/p>\n\n<p>During my investigations I came accross a series of interesting articles devoted to \"cortical visual neuroprosthesis for the blind\" (read <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16317227\">this paper<\/a><sup>&lt;1><\/sup> from 2005 for review on this topic), but this is the treatment of conventional blindness, not the color blindness. There was no intersection in keywords or titles for color blindness and brain stimulation, both in the referenced articles and in the complete article database.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, I would suggest that you address some talented experimentalist with your question and maybe one day, who knows, we will read your name under the Nature article dedicated to the novel way to cure color blindness.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>&lt;1><\/sup> -- unfortunately not available publicly for free, I am sorry.<\/p>\n","answer_id":652,"question_id":642,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/827fb1dcc1982c1e26322c9b48f241dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1367,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1367/salain","reputation":459,"display_name":"Salain"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1347042348,"creation_date":1346975708,"body":"<p>Yes!  And no.  But first, some background.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your central nervous system has (or is believed to have, as do other primates) a number of different organizational structures.  Cells within a column (the cortex is composed of about 7 layers, and a column would be a vertical group of neurons from these layers) respond to stimuli with similar features.  There are also higher order structures of collections of columns, such as <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7105/fig_tab/nature05019_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">orientation pinwheels<\/a><sup>(1)<\/sup> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xsVku.jpg\" alt=\"orientation pinwheel\"> <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that in the above picture, color is used to indicate orientation and not what color the column responds to.  Color sensitivity itself is (as far as I'm up to date on things) simply known to occur in color opponency columns, see this <a href=\"http://neurosciences.us/courses/vision2/Color/tso88.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper by T'So<\/a><sup>(2)<\/sup> where for instance red and green color opponent columns would be found together more often than not.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key point to take away from that is that your cortex <strong>has<\/strong> to develop these columns.  Without them you wouldn't have normal color vision, even if you circumvented the retina and LGN entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p>That brings us to the \"Yes!\" part of my answer.  If you've got a person that lost their color vision late in life, they should have relatively developed color columns in their visual cortex and assuming that we could wire to those areas in a meaningful way, in sufficient resolution, and could manipulate their voltages in a directed manner (we can't) then they certainly should be able to see in color with direct cortical stimulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>However if someone was born without color vision, I do not believe this would be possible.  Not without more work than simply sending a signal in, since there is <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/290332a0\" rel=\"nofollow\">strong evidence<\/a><sup>(3)<\/sup> that development of the columnar organization of V1 requires visual input during later stages of development.  I have read some cases where they took people with very simple retinal diseases (photoreceptor loss) and attempted to restore their vision.

The two major cases are neurons that are truly isolated from each other, and collections of neurons that connect together.  Since your question refers to firing and synchronized bursts, I'll restrict my discussion to the generation of spontaneous action potentials - but keep in mind that not all synaptic communication requires an action potential (the vast majority of internal connections within the retina, for example)<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of ensembles neurons in vitro, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_neuronal_network#Spontaneous_Network_Activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">spontaneous activity is fairly typical<\/a>.  One simple way to get this activity is for a subset of cells in the network to be inherently spontaneously active.  In the case of single, isolated neurons, this kind of individual cell spontaneous activity could also result in a single neuron firing spikes in a periodic fashion.  So for example purposes, let's explore how a single cell could produce this kind of activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since action potentials are triggered by a sufficiently strong depolarization, we need to identify potential membrane polarizing sources.  When dealing with single cells, the major controllers of cell membrane voltage potential are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel\" rel=\"nofollow\">voltage gated ion channels<\/a>.  When open these channels can cause, depending on their type and cellular/extracellular conditions, either a depolarization or hyperpolarization in the cell.  And, most interestingly, whether they are open or not <strong>depends on the cell membrane's polarization state<\/strong>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That makes voltage gated channels excellent at feedback: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a depolarizing channel that is depolarization gated will further activate itself once activated, leading to yet more activation.  This is a positive feedback cycle.<\/li>\n<li>a hyperpolarizing channel that is depolarization gated will, upon depolarization of the cell open and serve to hyperpolarize the cell until the initial depolarization has been removed.  In this way it would serve as a negative feedback source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Physiologists have thoroughly characterized many of these cells, and they have many more states beyond an \"open\" and \"closed\", such as different levels of \"inactivated\".  But we don't need to know about those to answer your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>The last piece we do need is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion\" rel=\"nofollow\">brownian motion<\/a> which is the movement of particles due to their bombardment by other particles.  This motion can with some frequency <a href=\"http://nerve.bsd.uchicago.edu/FB/PhysiolRev.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">cause voltage gated channels to spontaneously open or close<\/a>, which introduces noise into the system.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, if you have a positive feedback channel that is gated spontaneously, it will make it briefly more likely for other depolarization gated channels to be activated.  Positive feedback can quickly lead to a rapid depolarization of the cell, which could be observed as a burst of spikes.

Due to this lack of convergence they can be somewhat smaller than normal cells (particularly in the size of their dendritic arbors) earning them the moniker \"midget\" ganglion and bipolar cells (also P cells).  By reducing the magnitude of photoreceptor convergence onto ganglion cells, the retina sacrifices luminal sensitivity for spatial acuity.  Or put another way, a downstream neuron in the LGN/V1 can be more \"certain\" about which photoreceptor is sending information when light is bright, but less certain that any information is being sent when light is dim.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other side of the question you bring up is how the retinal ganglion cells themselves alter the image formed onto the photoreceptor layer.  For those that don't already know, photoreceptors are located at the very back of the retina.  Since they're the major light sensitive part of the retina, that means light has to go through the ganglion cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and all of their associated processes before reaching the actual photosensitive part of the eye.  So, why not put photoreceptors at the front of the eye?  One major reason is metabolic, photoreceptors are tightly coupled with the retinal pigment epithelium which helps to re-process used photopigment as part of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal#Visual_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">the retina's vitamin A cycle<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>How can those two factors, a one to one correspondence and a decrease in thickness be present at the same time?  For reference, let's locate a cross section of a primate macula<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FUeS8.jpg\" alt=\"monkey retina h&amp;e\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Dark areas are cell nuclei.  The innermost layer of cells (bottom of the image) are ganglion cells, the next layer of cells up is bipolar cells (the inner nuclear layer) and the next layer up is photoreceptor cell bodies.  you can make out the cilial stalks of the photoreceptors pointing upwards toward the RPE.<\/p>\n\n<p>From this image we can see a few transformations happening in the macula:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The photoreceptor layer is thicker, up to 7 or 8 cell bodies deep.  This means higher photoreceptor density.<\/li>\n<li>The outer plexiform layer (photoreceptors to bipolar cell connections) is considerably thicker.  A single cone should connect to fewer bipolar cells in the retina, so how does this make sense?  We'll find the answer in #3.<\/li>\n<li>The outer nuclear layer is only one cell thick.  This is the first layer that is actually thinner in the foveal region.  The cell bodies for photoreceptors from tis region have been displaced laterally, and the outer plexiform layer from #2 had to be larger to accommodate this lateral shift<\/li>\n<li>The inner plexiform layer, connections between bipolar cells and ganglion cells, is nonexistent.  Also absent is the ganglion cell layer itself.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So how do these observations resolve your question?  Quite simply, the lateral movement of information from the foveal/macular photoreceptors happens predominantly in the <strong>outer<\/strong> plexiform layer.  That buys the inner plexiform layer considerably more space to further spread those signals laterally to ganglion cells, and avoids the problematic situation you suggested of having an extra-thick ring of ganglion cells immediately around the fovea.  The end result is that ganglion cells that respond to photoreceptors in the foveal region of space are even further out from the retina than the bipolar cells they connect to, which are themselves displaced.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as why a cherry red spot looks so large, that honestly depends on two factors: the disease or disorder in question and the zoom used.  Bear in mind that the red color comes from, as far as I know, the blood vessels in the choroid itself.  It would therefore not necessarily correspond exactly to the size of the macula, but instead to any area which is thinned in that vicinity.  I think you'll become more comfortable with that idea if you look back at the thickness of the total retina in the above figure and notice that even outside of the foveal region it is still growing thicker.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think your question shows good instincts, because I believe that if the eye evolved to have a larger \"true\" fovea then you would get exactly what you describe: a large area of super high density vision surrounded by a region with non-linearly worse vision designed to support the central region.  Instead it appears that the primate macula is just large enough that we have a moderate sized central acute region and a (relatively) linear drop in spatial acuity moving out from it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3452,"question_id":1851,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1851/foveal-ganglion-cell-density-tay-sachs-disease","last_activity_date":1346968721,"creation_date":1334666622,"answer_count":1,"title":"Foveal ganglion cell density (Tay-Sachs Disease)","body":"<p>I\u2019m currently reading on Tay-Sachs disease and have stumbled upon something regarding the typical \u201ccherry red\u201d macula symptom.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the one hand it is mentioned that the macula is almost devoid of ganglion cells (GCs) and this actually the reason for the high acuity in this region since there is not obstruction of light [Suvarna JC, Hajela SA.

However, as the wiki article states, Leptin and Insulin based activities are the primary functions of adipocytes, so a high-fat diet would conceivably deal with either or both of those molecules.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the quirks of Leptin is that fad dieting or starvation techniques have a very undesirable affect on Leptin levels (for <em>years<\/em> after a starvation diet, sometimes) that cause adipocytes to accumulate lipids that they normally would not have.<\/p>\n\n<p>Obesity can also cause Leptin resistance (which <em>might<\/em> be aggravated by Fructose intake: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11723062\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11723062<\/a> ), much the same way that a diet rich in simple sugars can cause Type II Diabetes: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8532024\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8532024<\/a>  The Leptin levels are at the expected concentrations in obese individuals, but the proper neuro-receptor activity isn't taking place.<\/p>\n\n<p>Come to think of it, this may be what you're after. High fat diets will result in more Leptin and thus quicker/more Leptin resistance. Once Leptin resistance occurs, the mechanisms for controlling hunger are no longer as effective as they once were, resulting in more food intake and more weight gain.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the actual satiatory signal of Leptin is still debated. Some researchers have proposed that it's more of a \"starvation\" signal than a \"satiation\" signal, and thus Leptin resistance might be a normal condition when energy-dense foods are widely available: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19644451\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19644451<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":3397,"question_id":3346,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3bb465ba7c2338b41ef15a2a05306a7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":444,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/444/gianpaolo-r","reputation":3120,"display_name":"Gianpaolo R","accept_rate":40},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user1323"},"score":0,"post_id":3398,"edited":false,"creation_date":1346350485,"comment_id":5100,"body":"That second article is pretty horrible.

Humans have been around eating and drinking stuff long before the scientific method was around to study this question rigorously, and before there were regulatory agencies charged with approving new products as \"safe.\" As one might imagine, knowledge of what is and is not edible was likely passed down by oral tradition and personal experience.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I'm not even sure designating a food (or a substance) as edible or inedible really makes much sense. Let's consider wild fruit, as mentioned in your question. If ingesting 5 or more berries of hypothetical fruit X causes your body to have a nasty reaction, then we could probably agree that fruit X is toxic and inedible (even if eating only 1 or 2 berries might not elicit the same reaction). On the other hand, ingesting berries of hypothetical fruit Y causes no reaction unless consumed in much larger quantities (maybe 100 or more berries). Although fruit Y does cause a reaction when ingested in excessive amounts, it would be a stretch to call it inedible. This principle applies to many foods that we typically consider edible but can be unhealthy or even dangerous when taken in excess.<\/p>\n\n<p>So where do we draw the line? How much of a substance do you have to ingest without an adverse reaction to deem it edible? I don't think there is an objective answer to this question.

How did they evolve is still unclear, but several experiments have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_%28mimicry%29\">Wikipedia page about eyespots<\/a> gives a good basic introduction and some interesting references.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, first of all, how does an eyespot form?<\/p>\n\n<p>During the development of wings, eyespots arise at specific locations called <em>foci<\/em> (singular <em>focus<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you take cells from a focus in a developing wing, and transplant them into another region of the wing, an eyespot will develop at the transplanted site.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3eI9D.jpg\" alt=\"Transplanted focus\">\nAdapted from: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7004953\">Pattern Formation on Lepidopteran Wings: Determination of an Eyespot<\/a> - Nijhout, <em>Dev. Biol<\/em>, <strong>1980<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The photo on the left is a normal wing from an adult Buckeye butterfly, <em>Precis coenia<\/em>. In the middle and right photos, some cells of the big eyespots have been transplanted in a new position during development. As you can see, a third eyespot develops. Note that the middle photo is from an autograph, that is, the cells were transplanted on the same wing. This results in a shrinkage of the normal eyespot. In the right picture, instead, cells were transplanted in another individual, and this does not result in shrinkage of the eyespot.<\/p>\n\n<p>The authors conclude that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is evident from these experiments that the development of the large eyespot on the forewing of <em>Precis coenia<\/em> depends on the presence of a small group of cells that lie at or near its center. This group of cells corresponds to a \"focus\": a small region, occurring in each wing cell, that is postulated\n  to be responsible for the induction of most color pattern elements in butterflies and moths (Nijhout, 1978). Cautery experiments establish an upper limit for the size of this focus in the neighborhood of 300 epidermal cells, though it is probable that the actual size of the focus is much smaller.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They further speculate that a specific <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogen\">morphogen<\/a> may be involved:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The response of the eyespot pattern to cautery or transplantation of the focus is most readily interpreted if we assume that the focus is the source of a morphogen that is somehow able to induce synthesis of specific pigments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea that a morphogen was involved has been confirmed in later years.<\/p>\n\n<p>From: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12809139\">Development, plasticity and evolution of butterfly eyespot patterns<\/a> - Brakefield et al., <em>Nature<\/em>, <strong>1996<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The focus is proposed to be a signalling source for a morphogen, the levels of which determine the pigmentation of surrounding cells. Recent investigations have indicated that regulatory genes, such as the <em>Distalless<\/em> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox\">homeobox gene<\/a>, are specifically espressed in the eyespot focus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XxM86.jpg\" alt=\"Wing development\"><\/p>\n\n<p>During the development of the wing the expression of the <em>Distalless (Dll)<\/em> protein (shown in green in the picture) corresponds to the location of the future eyespots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Several mutations exist that will provoke changes in the eyespots patterns. Some of this with the evoking names of <em>Cyclops<\/em>, <em>Spotty<\/em> and <em>Bigeye<\/em> were analysed in the paper.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, without going much into insects genetics (which is far from being my domain of interest), you can clearly see that, although the number, position and size of the foci are affected by the mutations, their position always correspond with an increased expression of <em>Dll<\/em> during development.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/G9WPr.jpg\" alt=\"wing pattern mutants\"><br>\nLeft column: ventral hindwing patterns of a wild type (top), <em>Cyclops<\/em> (middle) and <em>Bigeye<\/em> mutants. Right column: forewing pattern in a wild type (top) and <em>Cyclops<\/em> mutant (bottom).<\/p>\n\n<p>From the conclusion of the paper (bold mine):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The selection experiments on <em>B. anynana<\/em> rapidly produced dramatic differences in eyespot size which were due to genes of small phenotypic effect.<\/strong> The mutants described here show that genes also exist with large phenotypic effect on eyespot development (including size) that have no perceptible effect on other wing or body patterns. It is likely that the evolution of eyespot patterns in nature involves both genes with large and small effects on eyespots development. [...]<br>\n  These observations suggest that the regulation of the eyespot developmental pathway is such that <strong>eyespot patterns can evolve rapidly and independently of other wing-pattern elements and body structures<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, another interesting read is:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243218\">Wings, Horns, and Butterfly Eyespots: How Do Complex Traits Evolve?<\/a> - Monteiro and Podlaha - <em>PLoS Biol.<\/em>, <strong>2009<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>where the authors propose that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Complex traits require co-ordinated expression of many transcription factors and signaling pathways to guide their development. Creating a developmental program de novo would involve linking many genes one-by-one, requiring each mutation to drift into fixation, or to confer some selective advantage at every intermediate step in order to spread in the population. While this lengthy process is not completely unlikely, it could be circumvented with fewer steps by recruiting a top regulator of an already existing gene network, i.e., by means of gene network co-option. Subsequent modifications of the co-opted network could further optimize its role in the new developmental context.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":3357,"question_id":3299,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1346112641}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3299/how-did-butterflies-evolve-to-have-eyes-on-their-wings","last_activity_date":1346112641,"creation_date":1345724446,"answer_count":3,"title":"How did butterflies evolve to have eyes on their wings?","body":"<p>Some butterflies, such as the UK native Peacock butterfly (<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=butterfly&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=5&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=0B02UP7HLYWa0QXLpoCgCQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775&amp;sei=0h02UJPQB6KI0AXNwYA4#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=peacock%20butterfly&amp;oq=peacock%20butterfly&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l9j0i5.7042.10989.0.11060.24.19.3.2.2.1.277.2983.1j10j6.17.0...0.0...1c.yTA7IQEyKSw&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=2434384cfc018328&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775\">Google Image Search<\/a>) have markings on their wings that look just like eyes, complete with a white fleck to imitate a convex, transparency effect, as though the \"eye\" is reflecting sunlight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Presumably, this pattern is designed to deter prospective predators, because the predator will see a creature with massive eyes looking at them and think twice before attacking.<\/p>\n\n<p>But how did the pattern evolve?
