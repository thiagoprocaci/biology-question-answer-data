DNA is much more stable than RNA as it has a stronger backbone and it is typically double stranded. But HIV mutates at a rate far higher than just being a RNA virus. That's because it uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT) to build it's RNA genome from RNA bases.<\/p>\n\n<p>RT is meant to copy the old HIV and make a new one but it does a rubbish job. Most the time it copies it well but every now and then (3 x 10<sup>âˆ’5<\/sup> per nucleotide base) it puts in a random base. That might seem like a small rate but that's HUGE if that was coding our genome we would die (if we ever even lived).

There's ones which are greatly infectious, partly infectious, slightly infectious and basically junk. The body doesn't really know which ones are which and that's the beauty of it all. The body tries to fight all of them and has no clue which one to get. If it happens to target the greatly infectious one, the numbers of this go down but then the partly infectious one will become the most infectious one and the cycle continues.

If so, there are several compounds your cat could be reacting to. Chlorine is an obvious candidate, which is released as sodium hypochlorite decomposes in solution. Additionally, bleach can react with various organic materials to release a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which your cat might be able to smell. In addition to also releasing chlorine gas, the same suite of VOCs are released when the chlorine in chlorinated tap water reacts with organic contaminants (Odabasi, 2008). The VOCs include chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, cats are known to exhibit modified behaviour in response to a variety of compounds. Some are suspected pheromone components of cat urine, such as felinine (Hendriks et al, 1995) and its breakdown products, such as MMB (Miyazaki et. al, 2006). <\/p>\n\n<p>Some cats also react to externally-produced compounds with a particular response called the 'catnip response', which involves rubbing the face on the ground or other objects, shaking the head, rolling, etc. (Tucker &amp; Tucker, 1988). Not all cats exhibit the response, around 50-50% do, and susceptibility is genetic and heritable. Some sources eliciting the catnip response include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>nepetalactone released from catnip (<em>Nepeta cataria<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>actinidine released from valerian (<em>Valeriana officinalis<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>essential oil of <em>Actinidia macrosperma<\/em> (Zhao et al., 2006)<\/li>\n<li>the compounds epinepetalactone, dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone, neonepetalactone, iridomyrmecin, boschnialactone, onikulactone, boschniakine, actinidiolide and dihydroactinidiolide (Tucker &amp; Tucker, 1988)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In general all the catnip response elicitors share a two-ring structure, which is not to my knowledge shared by any of the volatiles given off by bleach.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A possible experiment<\/strong><br>\nSo, two obvious possibilities (regarding what type of behavioural response is being elicited) are that either:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>your cat is interpreting the volatile as a pheremone and therefore as some sort of sexual or territorial signal, or<\/li>\n<li>it is showing the catnip response<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>As a first experiment, you could check whether your cat (and any others you can get hold of - in an ethical way) respond to bleach and/or to catnip. If the cats do not exhibit the catnip response to catnip, they aren't exhibiting it in response to bleach, and thus some other explanation is more likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a second experiment, you could make a detailed observation of the precise behaviour shown in response to bleach. Compare it to that exhibited when the cats encounter catnip (depending on the outcome of the first experiment) and when they are oestrous (if female) or encounter an oestrous female (if male). You could also compare to the response to the urine of other (male and female, familiar and unfamiliar) cats.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>An experiment you shouldn't do<\/strong><br>\nIf you wanted to find out which chemical your cat is responding to, you could allow your cat to sniff pure chlorine which hasn't encountered organic contaminants, as well as chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. However, <strong>all three of those compounds are extremely dangerous<\/strong> and could easily kill you or your cat, so please don't. <\/p>\n\n<p>I general, I would caution against exposing your cat to bleach, because it can induce serious health effects depending on dose and mode of exposure, ranging from asthma to third-degree burns to carcinogenesis. If they are attracted to it, that is a good reason to keep it away from them to prevent them ingesting it, which is more harmful than inhaling the fumes.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can't comment on whether the behaviour is acquired as result of domestication, but that too could be tested by comparing the reaction of a large sample of wild cats (!).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049195001301\">Hendriks, Wouter H., Paul J.

Contrary to what it seems to suggest there, absolute fitness is computed <em>across<\/em> a single generation, not <em>within<\/em> a single generation. For simplicity, let's look at an example using asexual haploids with discrete non-overlapping generations. If individuals with the A genotype produce an average of 3 offspring, each of which survive with probability 0.5, the A genotype has an absolute fitness of 1.5. The key is that we've multiplied fecundity (3) by viability (0.5) and this allows us to obtain a value greater than 1. <\/p>\n\n<p>Things get more complicated if we look at diploid sexuals. The absolute fitness of the Aa genotype is <strong>not<\/strong> the ratio of the number of individuals with the Aa genotype at time t+1 to the number of Aa at time t. An easy way to see this: in a population of AA and aa parents only, e.g. as produced by a cross, the ratio of Aa at t+1 to Aa at t is infinite, which would imply infinite fitness if we went this with definition. Rather, the absolute fitness of the Aa genotype is one-half the number of surviving offspring at time t+1 produced by Aa parents at time t. The one-half comes from the fact that a parent individual contributes only one-half of the genetic material of each surviving offspring. For some traits, e.g. those involved in sex ratio determination or parental care, it will not be sufficient to count surviving offspring; in these cases we apply comparable logic to counting grand-offspring. <\/p>\n\n<p>The wikipedia seems to suggest we are to look only at viability because we are comparing before-selection numbers to after-selection numbers, within a single generation and thus without an opportunity for fecundity to come into play. That is not consistent with the common usage of the term. To be fair, I have on rare occasion seen \"absolute fitness\" used as a synonym for \"viability\"--though I cannot think of any good justification for this usage. <\/p>\n","answer_id":29838,"question_id":29832,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1424664310},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1424796260,"creation_date":1424663913,"body":"<p>Welcome to Biology.SE!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition of Absolute Fitness<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Let's forget about the wikipedia definition for a little while.

In such case, when talking about one generation, we think of a population of adults that gets entirely replaced by a new population of offspring. Thinking about semelparous species has the advantage (among other advantages) to avoid confusion about lifetime reproductive success versus rate at which offsprings are produced. So, yes in one generation there is reproductive events. Even if selection on survival hasn't yet occurred on the offsrpings of the parents in a given generation, the fitness of these parents during this generation is calculated in function of the number of offspring that will survive later. Hope that makes sense. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Relating the above definition to your question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let's relate the above to the wikipedia definition. Absolute fitness is NOT \"the ratio between the number of individuals with that genotype after selection to those before selection\". It is only the number of offsrpings produced by an individual for a given period (often the whole life of the individual. It can eventually be the number of offsprings that survive to a given age (selection on survival). Wikipedia seems to be wrong unless it has been misquoted. You should indicate where you read that so that one can correct wiki if there is indeed an error.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Relative Fitness<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, relative fitness of a genotype/haplotype/individual for a given period of time (eventually the whole life of the individuals of interest) is just the absolute fitness of the individuals of interest divided by a standard absolute fitness. This standard absolute fitness is either the maximal absolute fitness observed in the population (or metapopulation) of interest or the maximum theoretical fitness based on some assumptions. For example we may calculate the relative fitness of an individual by dividing the absolute fitness of this individual by the fitness of a theoretical individual that would carry only the best possible mutations even though this individual doesn't exist in the population.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29839,"question_id":29832,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1424796260},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1424852156,"creation_date":1424686325,"body":"<p>That definition is problematic and incomplete. <em>Absolute fitness<\/em> can be used in different ways, and can be calculated at different levels of organisation (individuals, genes etc).

I notice that the center of the mass curves upward over time, and after a few more days of growth this colony will probably tear itself apart, leaving a gaping hole in the middle (based observation of similar contaminants on other plates, not pictured).<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect this is a very common lab contaminant. It grew to this size in less than 2 weeks, and was at 4C the entire time.

Since identifying species is not really my strong suit, I'd appreciate if you link to a protocol when suggesting methods.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> I have found 4 more plates, all LB-Ampicillin, with what I suspect to be the same contaminant.

As others have alluded to, the body generally recognises self and non-self. However, as with any biology it's not that simple. Even leaving aside autoimmune disorders, the body doesn't always attack non-self and doesn't always leave self alone. Think of a pregnancy - the foetus is non-self, and yet the body doesn't reject it. The same can be said for a whole host of molecules that enter the body, such as food or things breathed in (e.g. pollen).  For this reason, Charles Janeway put forward the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1739426\" rel=\"nofollow\">infectious non-self theory<\/a>. This postulated that the body had a degree of leniency towards non-self, and would only attack if the macrophages became activated. This is done through recognition of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen-associated_molecular_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow\">PAMPs<\/a>, binding to Pattern Recognition Receptors, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">PRR<\/a>s. These PRRs are receptors present on immune cell surfaces, though most relevantly on macrophage surfaces, and when they bind to PAMPs it sends a message to the cell that it's likely in contact with a pathogen (or at least there is likely a pathogen in the area somewhere). This causes activation, and starts an immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, it's also too simplistic to suggest that the immune system always leaves self alone, and in fact one of the key jobs of macrophages is to clean up self cells that are damaged, and undergoing apoptosis - programmed cell death. (You can read more on macrophages <a href=\"http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/macrophages-definition-function-types.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and more on apoptosis/other methods of cell death <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27980/why-do-some-cells-in-the-body-prefer-necrosis-to-apoptosis-as-a-means-of-cell-de/28004#28004\">here<\/a>). Therefore Polly Matzinger put forward what is known as the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danger Model<\/a>\". This basically speculates that in order for an immune response to occur, the body has to recognise certian molecules that are evolutionarily associated with danger. PAMPs would indeed count, but there could also be endogenous molecules such as HSPs - proteins produced when a cell is under duress through heat, pH, cold, irradiation, viral infection etc. This tells the immune cell that detects it that the body is in danger, and allows activation and mobilisation of an immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the question here is, would the body respond to a miniature version of yourself? That would depend on a number of factors:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Where in the body would you go?<\/strong> If you were to stay in the digestive tract, so get swallowed and 'passed through' the body, I would say it's very unlikely you would be attacked. The body has a high tolerance for places such as the gut, because it's constantly exposed to external and non-self molecules. If it were in the blood stream, it's more likely because you're more likely to come across immune cells.\n<br><strong>How is this 'shrinkage' achieved?<\/strong> Growth comes in two ways, through increase in cell size and increase in cell number. Which of these are you reducing? Are the cells the same size, but there are many fewer of them (unlikely, especially given that the opening question specifies to bacterium size, which are many times smaller than human cells already) or do you have the same number of cells but each cell is shrunk to a much smaller size (given that the entire body is the size of a bacterium, each cell would have to be many times smaller than a bacterium). If the cells were the same size, or even a bacterium-sized each, then an immune response is much more likely. If the whole organism is the size of a bacterium, the cells are going to be far too small to elicit an immune response.\n<br><strong>Are you causing danger signals<\/strong>? As mentioned above, if no danger signals are present then it's unlikely an immune response will be launched regardless of anything else. Provided you're not killing or injuring cells, the body will pretty much ignore you.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would say you wouldn't be attacked if you shrunk down as far as you've suggested. Everything would be too small for the body to recognise. However, if you didn't shrink down nearly as far, so your cells remained a size the body could recognise, and then started blundering about causing all manner of danger signals around you, the body may pick up some of your antigen and launch a response against you. On the other hand, the body is likely to have become tolerant to your antigens so even if this was the case, a full immune response is unlikely.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29884,"question_id":29809,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DNPz8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11841,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11841/one-face","reputation":2241,"display_name":"One Face","accept_rate":73},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1424796362,"creation_date":1424796362,"body":"<p>The immune system recognizes patterns - incase of innate immunity and shapes - incase of active immunity.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am making a few assumptions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Shrinking would result in a smaller version of \"the person\" - meaning he/she is a bacteria sized person capable of executing all actions that a human can do.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The shrunk person is placed inside the blood vessel or some place where the immune cells will have easy access.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now, the answer would basically depend on two factors:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The pattern recognition: It is higly unlikely that the innate immunity would recognize anything that is so small - As the person himself is the size of bacteria, the pattern recognition would be unable to find the patterns.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The Shape recognition  - This might be able to identify a specific structure.

The process in brief is for example: you see a wheat individual with short stems, an other with big grains. You want both. In classical selection you have to breed the two, select the descendants, breed again, select etc... until all descendants have both characters. Using GMO you can simply pick the gene you want and put it in the strain of your liking. It is much, much faster and the changes in the genome are much less than what you get by breeding two strains.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) GMO embedding genes from other species<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be more problematic as the gene you brought in could be from an organism nobody did ever eat, such as the Bt toxin in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MON_810\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"MON 810\">MON 810<\/a>, hence the questions about toxicity. It doesn't mean it's toxic and the controls are very stringent about that but I can understand better why such GMO should be carefully checked.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) The false problem of GMOs and environment<\/p>\n\n<p>A Last problem is the indirect effect of the GMO, for example, if it's designed to be herbicide tolerant it might allow more herbicide to be poured on the plants and hence cause more herbicide residuals to be in the food, or in the environment, people then not liking GMO for environmental related reasons. But that should be addressed by checks on herbicides in food or in the environment, not by banning GMOs!<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, GMOs have been around now for 20 years and people against GMO have a very hard time showing any kind of negative effects (see links posted previously), and some studies \"proving\" the toxicity have been shown to be statistically weak, not to say fraudulent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Conclusion <\/p>\n\n<p>There is no good reason to reject type 1) GMOs based on food safety and very little reasons to reject type 2) GMOs.

But holding a wet cotton swab with pressure to the inside of the nose might.<\/p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of bloody noses in healthy individuals arise from one specific area in the nose (on either side):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tDxYJ.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In the mucosa of the nasal septum (the cartilagenous structure separating the nose into two sides), there is an area where several arteries \"meet\", giving it an exceptionally rich vascular supply, called Kiesselbach's plexus. It is on the anterior surface, and exposed to dry air and trauma (even such as might be sustained by a bad cold). Bleeding typically occurs when the mucosa erodes for any reason, and the capillaries and venules (and sometimes arterioles) become exposed and subsequently break. The result is the familiar bloody dripping of a nosebleed.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most common treatment is <em>direct pressure<\/em> (squeezing the sides of the nose together) for 5-10 minutes. This works because putting direct pressure on any bleed stops the blood flow long enough for a clot to form and the arteriole to close down.\nIf needed, more aggressive control can be achieved by a professional.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you happen to apply pressure with the wet cotton swab to a large enough part of the plexus (or somewhere near the spot from which your nose is bleeding), your nosebleed will stop. But it really doesn't matter what you use to wet the cotton swab (plain water, oxygenated water, carbonated water (ouch!), or other. (<em>Noted: OP added that the liquid is hydrogen peroxide. This is not a good idea as it is an irritant and actually can cause mucosal damage.<\/em>) Sufficient pressure and clot formation (and subsequent tenderness with the nose) is all that is needed.*<\/p>\n\n<p>What doesn't work: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>icepacks to the neck<\/li>\n<li>leaning your head forward (increases blood flow) or back (may cause the blood to flow into your throat)<\/li>\n<li>lying down (increases blood flow)<\/li>\n<li>frequent 'peeking' to see if bleeding has stopped<\/li>\n<li>a dry object placed against the area of bleeding (it will break up the clot when pulled away from the septum)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Aftercare and prevention is another subject.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: The safest way to end a common nosebleed is by squeezing as much of the 'rubbery' portion of the nose together for up to 30 minutes if necessary.

It is extremely hypothetical and would be a better fit on <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com\">WorldBuilding.SE<\/a>. But here is my messy attempt to answer this question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So, I guess in your question, you assume that we know everything about how our genotype (â‰ˆthe genes of an individual) make up the phenotype (â‰ˆhow we look basically). So, I will try to give a short answer to this question by assuming that we were to know exactly what would happen if we were to add the sequence <code>ATTTAG<\/code> in the somewhere in the alpha-globulin gene or the sequence <code>CCTATA<\/code> somewhere in the regulatory sequence of the lactase gene. It is important to understand that today we are very far from having such knowledge. I also assume that we are able to recreate the environments we need to develop the new thing (human2.0 if you want) that we would have engineered. For example if we make up humans that need to grow in a different environment than the womb. By the end of the answer, I will pretty much assume that we know everything that can be known about organic chemistry and how chemicals process genetic information. Note that to the point we're doing the drastic modifications I will be talking about, it will be a philosophical issue to decide whether the new species we created is a human or not (it may even come to the discussion whether the new thing we created is a living thing or not).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Resistant to evolution as a species or only resistance as an individual?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Are talking about a species that would definitely be resistant to survive in these extreme environments or are you talking about a bunch of individuals surviving in this extreme environments. The difference is \"evolution\". Species evolve and not necessarily in the right way. High radiation may yield to high mutation rate and therefore to mutational meltdown (decrease in mean fecundity of the population through time yielding to extinction of the species).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>General Limitation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>With these very extreme assumptions, then we are only limited by physics. We could not add wings of the size of the wings of a warbler to a big animal like human and hope that it is going to fly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Resistance to radiation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I know little about this subject but will try to say some things that may eventually help you. We cannot really make our DNA insensitive to radiation (although we may eventually make our DNA slightly more stable) because radiation will alter matter. It is a physical process that cannot be altered. We may create a lot more of tumour suppressor genes to protect ourselves from developing cancer. Eventually we could create a species that would be able to synthesize (and carry) a concrete shield around its body to protect itself from radiation. But it might eventually be easier to code genetic information with something else than DNA! Eventually made up of quartz because quartz is relatively insensitive to radiation. We could indeed create a whole new form of life.<\/p>\n\n<p>High radiation yield to high mutation rate and high mutation rate may likely lead a species to extinction (mutational meltdown) but not necessary directly kill the first generations of this made-up species.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Extending lifespan<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This sounds \"easier\". We may \"just\" target the alleles (=variant of a gene) that are known to diminish the human lifespan, to slightly (but probably considerably) increase human lifespan. Again, I assume that we can know these alleles and can replace them with better variants. However, evolutionary processes will just recreate those genes, just because there always has an equilibrium between the rate at which new deleterious mutations appear and selection purging the genome from these mutations. Moreover, at an age where reproduction has already occurred selection is less important and it allows for deleterious allele that are expressed late in the age of the individual to eventually spread in the population. <\/p>\n","answer_id":29821,"question_id":29818,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1424631635}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29818/how-far-can-we-go-in-engineering-our-own-evolution","last_activity_date":1424631635,"creation_date":1424625147,"answer_count":1,"title":"How far can we go in engineering our own evolution?","body":"<p>After recently seeing Christopher Nolan's <em>Interstellar<\/em> and reading Kip Thorne's <em>The Science of Interstellar<\/em>, I've seriously been reflecting on the challenges mankind faces in becoming space pioneers, which in my belief will be a necessity to survive as a species.

Pain relief (both physical and emotional) is a significant part of medicine, yet we still have \"pain scales\" for self-reported pain, one of the more common ones being the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UEnH8.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, note well that even this scale must be interpreted for the patients.

For political and emotional reasons, humans are ill-disposed to do so (how could we then justify eating, exploiting, experimenting on animals, etc.). Even into the late '80's, veterinarians were taught that animals didn't perceive pain <em>per se<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How we know animals understand pain<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To determine whether animals can experience actual pain (not simply nociception), it is necessary to show that they<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>can discriminate painful from nonpainful states; make decisions based on this discrimination in a way that cannot arise from evolved nonconscious nociceptive responses; demonstrate motivations to avoid pain; and display affective states of fear or anxiety if threatened with noxious stimuli. In addition, animals experiencing pain might be expected to exhibit spontaneous behavioral changes including sustained signals of distress and impairments in normal behaviors such as sleep.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Animals show all these behaviors. Additionally, there is ample evidence that emotional pain in animals is real. The mere threat of foot shock (electric) induces signs of stress in rats and mice that can be alleviated with anxiolytics (drugs that reduce anxiety).<\/p>\n\n<p>Even <em>fish<\/em> show responses to a painful event: guarding behaviors, unresponsiveness to external stimuli and increased respiration, all of which improve with morphine. This is called analogous evidence: evidence that they are, mechanistically at least, directly analogous to pain responses in more complex animals. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Humans are animals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The nervous system of mammals is fairly identical to our own (we are animals). A chimpanzee who is afraid of a pin after being stuck with one 20 times in a row clearly <em>feels physical pain and fear<\/em>. That a chimp can mourn the death of a parent by not eating and not moving for days clearly indicates that they can experience <em>emotional pain.<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pain is subjective.

Scanning an entire chromosome (chr3, hg18) yields very high false positives (magnitudes higher than the true positives). Scanning the entire genome is much worse. <\/p>\n\n<p>From some literature and biostars posts, its recommended that I only scan sections of the genome to get an understanding of the accuracy of my PWM. Some posts talked about just scanning the promoter regions with my PWM (or say, a 1000bp neighbourhood around the promoter region). <\/p>\n\n<p>So, <em>is there a database or some sort of annotation that tells me where the promoter regions are?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling that this question may not be well formed because to get \"promoter\" regions, I need to be talking about genes. Since I am only working with the MEF2 family of transcription factors, is there a way to retrieve promoter regions in which these transcription factors bind?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>My idea:<\/strong> Since the TF binds upstream of the gene, usually in a promoter region, AND I know the true binding sites, would it be sufficient to just extract a 2000bp neighbourhood around the binding site? <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is what my data (only the first couple of lines) looks like:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;chr1:6585537-6585547(-)\n------ctatttatag-------\n&gt;chr1:228916512-228916522(+)\n------ctatttatag-------\n&gt;chr12:50731227-50731237(+)\n------ctatttatag-------\n&gt;chr13:49597702-49597712(+)\n------ctatttatag-------\n&gt;chr14:103058980-103058990(+)\n------ctatttatag-------\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>So again, is it sufficient to take <code>chr1:6585537-6585547(-)<\/code>, extract a 2000bp neighbourhood around it, and scan this neighbourhood with my PWM. Clearly, I know there is one true binding site and I'll compare it with the number of false postives it gives me.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>edit: Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have information (coordinates) for a total of 1875 binding sites. From these, only about 140 coordinates to binding sites on chromosome 3. These are my \"true binding sites\". If I scan chromosome 3 with my PWM, it gets around 85,000 hits.. ie, 85000 sequences that have scored very high that could be potential binding sites.

A growing number of prokaryotes have been discovered which have linear chromosomes, such as <em>Borrelia burgdorferi<\/em> ,which causes Lyme disease, members of the <em>Streptomyces<\/em> family and <em>Agrobacterium tumafaciens<\/em>, which has both a circular and a linear chromosome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, on to the question being asked: <\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, my feeling is that large circular chromosomes would have much greater supercoiling and related torsional problems, making it difficult to unwind them for transcription, replication or repair. This limitation on physical size limits the amount of genetic information that can be carried in a single chromosome, thereby limiting complexity of the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could increase the number of circular chromosomes to compensate for their lack of size, but again, you end up having a physical limitation (size of the nucleus or size of the cell for anuclear organisms) on how many chromosomes you can pack into the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>Linear chromosomes are just a more efficient shape when it comes to larger sizes.<\/p>\n\n<p>=====================<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are a few good references to dig further, if you're interested:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A new beginning with new ends: linearisation of circular chromosomes during bacterial evolution.

I'll restrain the following comment to GMO crops (as I strongly feel it is in that area that the hysteria whipped up by a public that is poorly educated in science harms society the most).<\/p>\n\n<p>The public perception often seems to be fall somewhere in between these two extremes: \"crazy scientists insert genes from jellyfish into [crop], making a jelly-[crop]-fish...which is just weird/wrong and must therefore be opposed\" or \"evil big corporation inserts bad genes into plants, which can then escape into the wild, transmit their bad genes into all other plants, and unleash...\"...err...zombie plants?<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I would suggest that a lot of people are blissfully unaware that MOST of our cash crops have been heavily genetically modified, through millenia of domestication, hybridisation and selection. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, durum wheat (commonly used in making semolina and pasta) is an artificial wheat crop, created sometime around 9000 years ago by farmers who crossed two different species of grass crops and selected for a hybrid polyploid plant that had favourable characteristics.<\/p>\n\n<p>The modern maize plant is another artificial organism created many millenia ago by mesoamericans through hybridization and artifical selection, two of the traditional genetic modification tools available to early farmers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The apple is a hybrid plant created through crossing of two different species of plants....again done at the dawn of civilization.<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect most people who are vehemently opposed to GMO technology are ignorant of the history of farming, let alone the science behind GMO.<\/p>\n\n<p>===============================<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, to answer your question, the \"concepts\" behind gene manipulation are very basic molecular biology techniques, applied in this context at improving the biochemistry of the organism.

A recent study in the Netherlands <em>did<\/em> find a relationship between the use of antibiotics and breakthrough pregnancy in a population-based <em>prescription<\/em> database; also, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Because of earlier studies, anecdotal reports, and the above (it's not possible to identify whose levels will drop with antibiotic use), a cautious approach is advised. Physicians and pharmacists (80-90% of both) still lean towards believing that broad-spectrum antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of COCs, and continue to advise the use of back-up contraception. <\/p>\n\n<p>The tide is shifting, however, as new studies come out. Here are a few excerpts of recent studies:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Available scientific and pharmacokinetic data do not support the hypothesis that antibiotics (with the exception of rifampin) lower the contraceptive efficacy of oral contraceptives. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2002;46:917-23.) <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Since dermatologists treat acne with antibiotics, and a significant percentage of these patients are young women of child-bearing age, they certainly have a vested interest in knowing if this is true.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rifampicin and griseofulvin induce hepatic enzymes and do appear to have a genuine interaction with the COCP, leading to reduced efficacy. The situation with the broad-spectrum antibiotics is less clear. There are relatively few prospective studies of the pharmacokinetics of concurrent COCP and antibiotic use and few, if any, demonstrate a convincing basis for any reduced contraceptive efficacy.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We did not find an association between concomitant antibiotic use and the risk of breakthrough pregnancy among COC users. However, due to limited power and potential carryover effects, findings from this study cannot rule out an elevated risk of COC failure among antibiotic users. (2011)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the answer is (except with your noted exceptions) the penicillin-class antibiotics <em>probably do not interfere with effectiveness of COCs.<\/em> However, one unwanted pregnancy is one pregnancy too many, and the use of a back-up method is not a huge deal (just ~14 days).<\/p>\n\n<p>Until more and larger studies demonstrate a lack of interaction between most antibiotics and COCs, this will likely be the advice people continue to receive.

If a 50 kg person walks up a mountain at 3 km/h, and a 100 kg person walks up the same mountain at the same speed, the 100 kg person will expend more energy, because they did more work. And then there are slight differences in how we do our movement - some people's gait is more efficient than others', and uses less energy. But this is not really interesting for the explanation of having it easy/hard to lose weight. <\/p>\n\n<p>The point is that the amount of food we intake is determined by our hunger, and our hunger is determined by hormones. Then, the amount of fat we store is also determined by hormones. If your body \"thinks\" you should be putting on weight, and you go on a calorie-reduced diet, it won't just start complementing the missing energy from the fat stored in your adipose tissue. Rather, it will continue diverting some of your food intake to make more fat storage, all the while rationing the energy available for other activities: making you feel tired so you don't move much, shutting down some luxurious, energy-hungry processes in the brain, mostly the ones associated with higher mental functioning, and making you feel hungry and cold so you will be more motivated to seek out food and eat. The hormones which regulate these processes are many, most of them are poorly understood, some are probably not yet discovered (orexin, one of the main hunger regulating compounds, was only discovered sometime in the last 5 years I think), and we really don't have a complete picture of everything that is involved. It is a complex mesh of finely balanced homeostatic systems which interact with each other and the environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>The people who say that it is as simple as \"calories in, calories out\" are right. They are right in the sense that, if you just observe a human being and measure their energy household, you will be able to document the amounts of energy consumed, expended and stored, and the energy consumed will equal the energy consumed plus the energy stored. <\/p>\n\n<p>But to derive from this that we are talking about a passive overflow system and, if we reduce intake, storage is also reduced, is a big leap of faith and has been proven wrong again and again. Living systems are actively reacting to any influences from outside, by mechanisms much more intricate than simple mechanic rules. Mechanics tells us that if I push you, you will fall over; experience tells us that if I push you, you will brace yourself so you don't fall over, and then try to stop me from pushing you by using words, force, or whatever else you have at your disposal. Our physiological systems are the same way. They like the situation they have chosen to be in as much as you like standing upright. If somebody comes from outside and tries to forcibly change their status quo, they do whatever they can to 1) resist and retain the status quo, and 2) stop the outside force if possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for the difference in metabolism: the hormone systems of different people are differently \"tuned\". For example, eating pure glucose causes insulin production to spike, and excess insulin causes glucose to be removed from the bloodstream, plus a handful of other effects. But the size of the insulin spike is different in different people. Also, the extent to which cells react to elevated insulin is different. When the reaction becomes dangerously weak at even high insulin levels, we say that it's a pathological variation, and call it \"metabolic syndrome\". If goes really towards zero, it's called diabetes type two. And this is an example about just one of the hormones connected to metabolism and the distribution and use of energy in the body. <\/p>\n\n<p>On a simpler level, there is no difference in metabolism where physical energy calculation is concerned. Expending one molecule of ATP will let the same number of Na+ ions to move the same distance along a nerve dendrite, across humans. But this level is not really interesting when it comes to gaining or losing weight. <\/p>\n","answer_id":21596,"question_id":21594,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ec774be1cba4651da76170214e1d5d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":14538,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14538/user3082","reputation":87,"display_name":"user3082"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":29737,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424438221,"comment_id":48526,"body":"The warming of the seat is anecdotal speculation.

This means they can discern characters of only 4,43 mm height from 6m.<\/p>\n\n<p>The normal car signs in the EU (and I think it is not very different in size in other countries) is 75 mm. So a very good observer can discern number plates from a distance of\n(75 mm / 4.46 mm) * 6 m = 100 meter or 109 yards, a normal observer from half the distance (50 m or 54 yards).<\/p>\n\n<p>People are mostly not aware how their sight is deteriorating.

Your son has no problem with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry, I don't think your son is superhuman.<\/p>\n\n<p>FOR THE CURIOUS: A rule of thumb is that normal sight has an acuity of 1 arcminute ('), the 60th part of a degree angle. This is a ratio of 0.000291 or 3 cm per 100 m (1 inch per 1 yard).\nA character to read consists of parts, let's look for example at E. E has five vertical\nsections and if you think about it, all other characters can be displayed if you have five\nsections available. So Snellen set the height of the characters to 5 arcminutes and the stroke width to one arcminute. The patient looks from 20 ft (= 6.096 m) away. So the height\nof the characters must be (5*0.000291)*6.096 = 8.866 mm<\/p>\n","answer_id":29681,"question_id":29662,"up_vote_count":19,"last_edit_date":1424470343},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/013706454f86fcb7b9977ccb3bb1fbbe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":14513,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14513/timmay","reputation":21,"display_name":"timmay"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da825085fd17516075d5bdb4289e32e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14507,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14507/claire","reputation":76,"display_name":"Claire"},"score":0,"post_id":29683,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424293074,"comment_id":48405,"body":"Thank you for your reply!

Adjusted Light and Dark Cycles Can Optimize Photosynthetic Efficiency in Algae Growing in Photobioreactors. *Plos One*\">Sforza et al. (2012)<\/a> have studied the effects of light conditions on algae (used for biofuel production), and their results indicate several problems with continuous light. In continuous light conditions they find lower chlorophyll contents and higher carotenoid concentrations in cells, which leads to lower photosynthetic efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/df7Dy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nThis figure shows chlorophyll contents (black) and chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio (red) under different conditions, with the two treatments to the left representing continuous light. (<em>graph from Plos One<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Results show that Nannochloropsis can efficiently exploit even very intense light, provided that dark cycles occur to allow for re-oxidation of the electron transporters of the photosynthetic apparatus. If alternation of light and dark is not optimal, algae undergo radiation damage and photosynthetic productivity is greatly reduced.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, they also experiment with pulsed light, which in some cases lead to even lower rates of photosynthesis:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, similar experiments, at different frequencies, also showed that alternating dark and light may be detrimental, as demonstrated by the growth inhibition observed in the 1200-1 and âˆ’5 Hz curves. These cells showed a decrease in Fv/Fm values similar to that observed under constant strong light, indicating that the inhibition of growth was due to photoinhibition.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They also find that light pulses can be very short, and still allow for the photosystem to reset:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The optimal duration of light pulses was found to be around 10 ms, which is consistent with the suggested PSII turnover rate in whole cells [4], [46]. Accordingly, after photon absorption by the photosystem, 1\u201315 ms are needed to reset the system, before it is ready to receive another photon [22]. If the illumination is this short, most photons are exploited for photosynthesis and do not lead to the formation of ROS which then causes photoinhibition. These results indicate that even strong light does not cause damage if it only lasts a short time. Conversely, longer exposure allows the generation of ROS and damage and, in this case, the abrupt changes in illumination undergone by the cells are as harmful to the photosynthetic apparatus as constant high light.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Different species of plants can have mechanisms to handle light stress in different ways, so the effects on different species and types of plants are likely to differ.

Most of CD4+ T-lymphocytes are active and can induce \u201ccytokine waterfall\u201d as well as secrete proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-y), IL-12, and other cytokines, eventually leading to inflammation. Experiments showed that Tanshinone significantly inhibited production of Th1-derived IL-12 and IFN-y in a dose-dependent manner. T-lymphocytes play a role in the formation of AS, mainly because of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by T helper type (Th) 1 or Th2. Therefore, Tanshinone can inhibit the formation of AS and stabilize plaques via reducing the secretion of Th1 or Th2. Moreover, T-lymphocytes are activated to express CD40L, and the expression of tissue factor and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is then promoted by interaction between CD40L and CD40. \nTanIIA could improve the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), decrease the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduce both the expression of CD40 and the activity of MMP-2.<\/p>\n\n<p>So normally macrophages could excrete cholesterols but problem occurs when your diet contains high level of cholesterol and oxLDL goes high in your blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2014 (2014), Article ID 267976, 6 pages\n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/267976\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/267976<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":29718,"question_id":28517,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1424387374}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28517/why-oxldl-accumulate-to-form-foam-cells","last_activity_date":1424387374,"creation_date":1423693366,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why oxLDL accumulate to form foam cells?","body":"<p>In atherosclerosis, why macrophage store all the cholesterol from oxLDL inside, and turns to foam cell, and not just degrade it and going back to blood?

Naively, I would expect that when I take my glasses off, the image I see should look very much the same as as a photograph that's out of focus, or an image to which someone has applied a Gaussian blur filter. In bright conditions this is mostly true, but at night if I look at distant point sources of light, the blurry halos around them appear to have quite a complex structure, and a fairly well-defined edge. Why is this?<\/p>\n\n<p>To make it clearer what I mean, and at the same time to make a hypothesis about the answer, here is a public domain image of some lights, taken with a camera out of focus:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ERRiY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://pixabay.com/en/bokeh-circles-background-light-69638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">image source<\/a>.) Notice that the image cast by each light is not simply a uniform circle. They are each slightly hexagonal; they are slightly brighter around the edge than in the middle; and there are distinct nonuniformities in the brightness in the interior of each shape.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I see is actually fairly similar to this but much more extreme. The shape formed by a light is much further from a circle, being very irregular in shape and distinctly elongated in one direction. (This latter is perhaps not surprising given that I have a strong <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_%28eye%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">astigmatism<\/a>.) The bright edge to the shape, and the non-uniformities in its brightness, are much more pronounced than in the camera image.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, in the photograph I know that the hexagonal shape is due to the hexagonal aperture in the camera. This can be ruled out in my eyes because my pupils are definitely circular. (Unless some light also passes through parts of the iris?) I would guess that the bright edges are caused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction\" rel=\"nofollow\">diffraction<\/a>, and that the nonuniformities are caused by defects in the lens and/or dirt on its surface. I suppose that diffraction and lens aberrations must be the causes of what I see when looking at distant lights without my glasses.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in the end, my question is mostly just, am I right about this? Are the shapes I see the result of defects in my eye's optics, and which specific anatomical features of the eye are likely to be their main causes?<\/p>\n","question_id":7782,"tags":["human-biology","vision","perception"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":430,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1419429093},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/663b15dcd11f4b652d65bc6279cbce05?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14528,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14528/pulp-fiction","reputation":101,"display_name":"pulp_fiction"},"closed_date":1424365056,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":1,"post_id":29710,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424352612,"comment_id":48474,"body":"Welcome to Biology.SE!

Come back on Biology.SE if something seems unclear to you.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics of genetics and evolution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You are definitely interested in concept of segregation. This is a very fundamental concept in genetics. The basis of the laws governing segregation has been first discovered by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gregor Mendel<\/a> and we still name these basics laws after Mendel. We talk about Mendelian segregation. You may want to google that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then you are interested in the concept of heritability. I have been talking about heritability in different posts. In the third sentence of my answer <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16858/are-people-genetically-predisposed-to-being-interested-in-specific-fields-ideas/16862#16862\">here<\/a>, there is a short list of posts that define the concept of heritability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Eye color you said?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You talked about the genetics of eye color inheritance. <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/728/how-is-eye-color-in-humans-inherited\">Here<\/a> is a post that will interest you then.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Genetics of Development<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your question is not only about genetics but is about the genetic of development. You may want to have a look to the basics of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">developmental biology<\/a>. The most famous DNA sequence  involved in determining the body plan of many different living things are the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox\" rel=\"nofollow\">homeobox<\/a>. There is plenty of interested things about this homeobox. This <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13808/how-does-the-colinearity-of-the-hox-genes-determine-the-body-plan-of-an-organism\">post<\/a> may interest you btw.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rough details about the evolution of development along the tree of life<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How come that information [architectural information] is not changed in thousands of years or even millions of years?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It really depends on what you call <code>architectural information<\/code>. But in any case it does evolve. If you think of things such as like size of an animal. Then it may evolve fairly quickly. You may thing of more important change, such as evolving a new pair of legs or evolving wings or a head, then it tends to take more time. Below are just a bunch of examples of how animals differ in terms of body plan along the tree of life.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be interested to study a bit the development or early animals. Some have a radial symmetry while other (like us) have bilateral symmetry (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>). Some animals have a head, some don't. Some animals have two dermes while others have three dermes. The <em>Deuterostomata<\/em> (vertebrates, tunicates, echinodermes, ...) have a development where the blastopore of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">gastrula<\/a> becomes the anus while in the <em>protestomata<\/em> (now thought to not be monophyletic and divided into <em>ecdysozoa<\/em> and <em>lophotrocozoa<\/em> (see <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Bilateria/2459\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>)) the blastopore becomes the mouth. Among the <em>arthropoda<\/em> (insects, spiders, millipedes, ...) the story is very interesting as well. Some have a highly segmented body with a pair of legs at each segment (millipedes) while other groups have fused those segments. Spiders have only two big body parts, while insects have three big body parts. In insects, the thorax (one of the 3 body parts with the head and the abdomen) contain three segments and each segment hold a pair of legs. The first flying insects also had three pairs of wings, now degenerated into two and even into one in <em>Diptera<\/em>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29712,"question_id":29710,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1424366903}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29710/core-architecture-of-the-body-encoding","last_activity_date":1424366903,"creation_date":1424351684,"answer_count":1,"title":"Core architecture of the body encoding","body":"<p>First of all, I am not a biology guy; I am in Computer Science.

From the top of my head, I recall that each child has about 30 mutations. If that's in the total genome and if they were all point mutations and there's 4 options for the base pair, then we have $30$ mutations out of 12 billion options in each child. So that each possible point mutation has a probability of $30/12 \\text{ billion} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}$ or $1/(2.5 \\times 10^{-9})$ if you like. The book's number is 23 times larger but in the same ballpark range. Lets call this probability $p$. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now the probability of a mutation occuring in n children <em>at least once<\/em> is equal to one minus the probability of it never occuring in n children. In other words:\n$$1 - (1 - p)^n =$$\n$$1 - (1 - 2.5 \\times 10^{-9})^n =$$\n$$1 - (0.9999999975)^n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>If we want the mutation to occur with probability 95%, we have to solve:\n$1 - (0.9999999975)^n = 0.9$\nThis has the solution $n = 1 \\times 10^9$<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, with 1 billion children, each point mutation has a 95% probability of having occured at least once. Mathematically this is not the same as saying that every mutation will have occured. In fact, this implies that 5% of the mutations will not have occured. But perhaps surprisingly, we only need 4-5 billion to up the chance to 99.999%. That still leaves out thirty thousand point mutations, but is sufficiently close to \"everyone\". <\/p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the numbers you mentioned:\nn = 17 million gives each gene a 4% chance of occuring\nn = 80 million gives each gene an 18% chance of occurring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a mandatory rant. :-) \"The Perfect Health Diet\" is written by Paul and Shou-Ching Jaminet, an astrophysicist and molecular biologist respectively. This has the potential to marry the physicist's penchance for oversimplification with the biologist's lack of mathematical prowess. We see both in the passage you ask about. A shoddy calculation about an oversimplification of what mutations and evolution is about. \nBoth the book's dustcover use of a word like \"detoxifying\" and mention of how diseases spontaneously resolve if you eat right, are both strong crackpot indicators. It's the kind of thinking that killed Steve Jobs because he didn't seek medical help soon enough but tried to eat his way out of his illness.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29659,"question_id":29658,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1424308151}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29658/what-is-the-expected-number-of-children-that-need-to-be-born-for-every-possible","last_activity_date":1424308151,"creation_date":1424248867,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the expected number of children that need to be born for every possible point mutation to occur once?","body":"<p>I'm reading The Perfect Health Diet, and in it the author says that the probability of a point mutation is (175/3*10^9) per new child.
