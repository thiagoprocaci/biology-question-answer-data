It is important first of all, to note that empirical observations show that <em>beneficial alleles tend to be more dominant than detrimental alleles<\/em>. Among the two main hypotheses to explain the evolution of dominance, one has been formulated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ronald Fisher<\/a> and one by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sewall Wright<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fisher's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Fisher's hypothesis, between two equally beneficial alleles, if one is more dominant than the other than it's heterozygote carrier will have higher fitness. In consequence, beneficial alleles evolve to become more dominant while detrimental alleles evolve to be recessive (so that they can hide from selection in heterozygotes).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Wright's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Wright's hypothesis, beneficial alleles are more dominant because of the kinetic of biochemical reactions. The rate of a biochemical reaction is a function of the concentration in the substrates of interest. The function is called \"Michaelis-Menten function\" after the name of the authors. The Michaelis-Menten function looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFgql.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Think about a knock-out mutation. Such mutation will decrease by half the concentration of protein the gene in question produce in heterozygotes. Imagine, the concentration of proteins in the wildtype homozygote was 3 (see above graph). The rate of reaction of this homozygote is therefore about 3. The heterozygote would have a concentration of 1.5 and the rate of the reaction is therefore about 2.5-2.75. Assuming that the rate of this biochemical reaction is directly related to fitness, then a the locus of interest, benefical alleles are necessarily dominant and detrimental alleles are necessarily recessive. Selection for dominance is not involved in Wirght's model.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is Fisher's or Wright's hypothesis correct?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Current state of the art is to consider Wright's model to be correct and Fisher's model to be wrong. In reality, the truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes. Note also that some other alternative explanations may exist in the literature but Wright and Fisher original hypotheses are by far the most considered hypotheses for the evolution of dominance. During my undergrad, I remember a speaker (but I forgot his name, sorry!) who showed that some alleles actually have some domain that are directly responsible for decreasing the expression of the other allele on the sister chromosome suggesting that Fisher's hypothesis might sometime be a good explanation as well.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27583,"question_id":27569,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1420995616}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27569/why-is-an-allele-dominant-or-recessive","last_activity_date":1420995616,"creation_date":1420972772,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is an allele dominant or recessive?","body":"<p>Alleles refer to duplicate genes, where one allele can be dominant over the other.

One type, the fast response, occurs in normal atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the specialized conducting fibers (Purkinje fibers of the heart)and is divided into five phases. The rapid upstroke of the action potential is designated phase 0.The upstroke is followed by a brief period of partial, early repolarization (phase 1) and then by a plateau (phase 2) that persists for about 0.1 to 0.2 second. The membrane then repolarizes(phase 3) until the resting state of polarization (phase 4) is again attained (at point e). Final repolarization (phase 3) develops more slowly than depolarization (phase 0).<\/p>\n\n<p>Genesis of the Upstroke (Phase 0)<\/p>\n\n<p>The action potential amplitude (the potential change during phase 0) is dependent on [Na+ ]o.\nThe Na+ channels open very rapidly or activate (in about 0.1 msec), thereby resulting in an abrupt increase in gNa . However, once open, the Na+ channels inactivate (time course ˜1 to 2 msec), and gNa rapidly decreases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genesis of Early Repolarization (Phase 1)<\/p>\n\n<p>In many cardiac cells that have a prominent plateau, phase 1 is an early, brief period of limited repolarization. This brief repolarization results in the notch between the end of the upstroke and the beginning of the plateau . Repolarization is brief because of activation of a transient outward current (ito ) carried mainly by K+ . Activation of K+ channels during phase 1 causes a brief efflux of K+ from the cell because the cell interior is positively charged and [K+ ]i greatly exceeds [K+ ]o . The cell is briefly and partially repolarized as a result of this transient efflux of K+ .The size of the phase 1 notch varies among cardiac cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genesis of the Plateau (Phase 2)<\/p>\n\n<p>During the action potential plateau, Ca++ enters myocardial cells through calcium channels During the flat portion of phase 2 , this influx of Ca++ is counterbalanced by the efflux of K+ . K+ exits through channels that conduct mainly the ito , iK , and iK1 currents. The ito current is responsible for phase 1, as described previously, but it is not completely inactivated until after phase 2 has expired.\nDuring the plateau (phase 2) of the action potential, the concentration gradient for K+ across the cell membrane is virtually the same as it is during phase 4. However, Vm is now positive. Therefore, there is a large gradient that favors efflux of K+ from the cell. If gK were the same during the plateau as it is during phase 4, efflux of K+ during phase2 would greatly exceed the influx of Ca++ , and a sustained plateau could not be achieved. However, as Vm approaches and then attains positive values near the peak of the action potential upstroke, gK suddenly decreases . The diminished K+ current associated with the reduction in gK\nprevents excessive loss of K+ from the cell during the plateau. This reduction in gK at both positive and low negative values of Vm is called inward rectification. Inward rectification is a characteristic of several K+ currents, including the iK1 current For these channels, large K+ currents flow at negative values of Vm (i.e., gK is large). However, when Vm is near 0 mV, or positive, as occurs during the plateau (phase 2), little or no K+ current flows (i.e., gK is low). Thus, the substantial gK that prevails during phase 4 of the cardiac action potential is largely due to the iK1 channels, but current through these channels is greatly diminished during the plateau.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sv0GC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Other K+ channels play a role in phase 2 of the action potential. These are characterized as delayed rectifier (iK ) channels. These K+ channels are closed during phase 4 and are activated very slowly by the potentials that prevail toward the end of phase 0. Hence, activation of these channels tends to increase gK very gradually during phase 2. These channels play only a minor role during phase 2, but they contribute to the process of final repolarization (phase 3), as described later. Two types of iK channels exist, depending on their rates of activation. The more slowly activating channel is designated the iKs channel, whereas the more rapidly activating channel is designated the iKr channel . The duration of the action potential in myocytes in various regions of the ventricular myocardium is determined in part by the relative distributions of these iKr and iKs channels.\nGenesis of Final Repolarization (Phase 3)<\/p>\n\n<p>The process of final repolarization (phase 3) starts at the end of phase 2, when efflux of K+ from the cardiac cell begins to exceed influx of Ca++ . As noted, at least three outward K+ currents (ito , iK , and iK1 ) contribute to the final repolarization (phase 3) of the cardiac cell.<br>\nRestoration of Ionic Concentrations (Phase 4)<\/p>\n\n<p>The steady inward leak of Na+ that enters the cell rapidly during phase 0 and more slowly throughout the cardiac cycle would gradually depolarize the resting membrane voltage were it not for Na+ ,K+ -ATPase, which is located in the cell membrane. Similarly, most of the excess Ca++ ions that had entered the cell mainly during phase 2 are eliminated principally by a 3Na+ -1Ca++ antiporter, which exchanges 3 Na+ ions for 1 Ca++ ion. However, some of the Ca++ ions are eliminated by an ATP-driven Ca++ pump.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27577,"question_id":14902,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1420990545}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14902/voltage-gated-potassium-channels-in-the-action-potential-of-cardiomyocyte","last_activity_date":1420990545,"creation_date":1391767219,"answer_count":1,"title":"Voltage-gated Potassium channels in the action potential of cardiomyocyte?","body":"<p>There is one type of potassium voltage-gated channels open in Phase 1 too.\nSome call them early repolarization channels.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not convinced that the channels are different in different phases: 0, 2, 3 and 4.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think all these potassium channels are voltage-gated.\nHowever, they probably differ in some places.\nI am not sure if one type of channel can be open in all these five phases.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Which types of potassium channels are open during the action potential of cardiomyocyte?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":14902,"tags":["physiology","cardiology"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":199,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1391802371},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/504fc12cdb5fc58368804eace5dd2801?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12933,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12933/dami%c3%a1n-gil","reputation":48,"display_name":"Damián Gil"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":8,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1420983651,"creation_date":1420894404,"body":"<p>Flies rubbing their legs are <strong>cleaning themselves<\/strong>.

Including cases where one twin looks white and one twin looks black. This can happen when you have one white and one black parent, the children can end up being quite white or quite black and twins can look different.

The Swedish media reports the case of a seven year old girl recovering from hypothermia of 13°C (<a href=\"http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666\">3<\/a>) (though children are often more resilient than adults).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hyperthermia<\/strong> (when the body is too hot - known in its acute form as heatstroke) and is medically defined as a core body temperature from 37.5\u201338.3 °C <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia\">(4)<\/a>.  A body temperature of above 40°C is likely to be fatal due to the damage done to enzymes in critical biochemical pathways (e.g. respiratory enzymes).<\/p>\n\n<p>As you mentioned <strong>burns<\/strong>, I will go into these too. Burns are a result of contact with a hot object or through infra-red (heat) radiation. Contact with hot liquid is referred to as a scald rather than a burn. Tests on animals showed that burns from hot objects start to take effect when the object is at least 50°C and the heat applied for over a minute.

The tissue affected will eventually literally freeze, causing cell destruction. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite\">7<\/a>)  Similarly to hypothermia, frostbite is divided into four degrees (that can be viewed on Wikipedia).<\/p>\n\n<p>As to the matter of global warming cooking us to death, I would imagine that it would be more indirect changes that got us first.  If the average temperature had risen  to the necessary 40°C to cause heat-stroke, sea levels would have risen hugely due to the melting of the polar ice caps.  Crops and other food sources would likely be affected too, therefore I don't think that global warming is overly likely to <em>directly<\/em> kill humans.<\/p>\n","answer_id":548,"question_id":546,"up_vote_count":24,"last_edit_date":1354377888},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2jNxG.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":368,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/368/ultimate-gobblement","reputation":827,"display_name":"Ultimate Gobblement","accept_rate":86},"score":8,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db9ae27234bc59746a27fd63accabd12?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5988,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5988/muhd","reputation":101,"display_name":"Muhd"},"score":0,"post_id":701,"edited":false,"creation_date":1441996217,"comment_id":64450,"body":"45C = 113F, 100C = 212F"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1386693005,"creation_date":1326818402,"body":"<p>As Rory explained, internal body temperature needs to be highly regulated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sweating is the main built in mechanism for removing excess heat from the human body.

The atrium's function is to fill the ventricle with as much blood as it can and the ventricle then pump the blood away. Also there is a system of valves to control blood flow on each side. Basically this is how our heart works.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to make this system work we need to have a coordinated movement of atrium and ventricle, that is, first atrium is filled, then it pumps blood into ventricle, valve closes and then ventricle compresses. \nThe movement of heart muscle causes currents that can be measured (this is the ECG pronounced EKG). These currents are representative of the movements of atrium and ventricles are expressed respectively as p waves (for atria) and qrs (for ventricles). <\/p>\n\n<p>It is the case that atria are not very important and sometimes they can stop working properly. They now longer have coherent movement and stop helping to pump blood into the ventricles, but they still move. This event is called atrial fibrillation. <\/p>\n\n<p>From this explanation one can expect that no longer p waves will be identifiable in the ecg, but instead a random noise overlapping with \"normal\" qrs representing normal ventricular movement. The movement is actually not exactly normal, because the ventricular contraction due to atrial fibrillation now occurs at random times, that is qrs complexes occur with random spaces between them. The explanation for this is rather more complex: there are bundles of specialized cardiomyocites with different frequencies of depolarization. The fastest ones are on SAN and basically guide the whole heart rhythm through specialized bundles. When you have atrial fibrillation, the depolarization signals no longer come from these preferential bundles, but from any part of the atria at random. This causes the ventricles to initiate motion at irregularly spaced intervals.\nI've included a photo of a normal rhythm and a atrial fibrillation side by side, but I hope you can use this explanation to find better ones by yourself in the web.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: don't confuse atrial fibrillation with atrial flutter. Flutter is a faster paced regular (therefore organized) atrial movement. It will appear as a saw-tooth shaped wave with regularly spaced qrs complexes.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cUhHR.jpg\" alt=\"a-fib\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Causes of atrial fibrillation are numerous, bur mainly high blood pressure, vascular disease, heart and lung disease among others.

Therefore, ventricular fibrillation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mechanism of atrial fibrillation, except that the process occurs only in atrial muscle mass instead of the ventricular mass. A frequent cause of atrial fibrillation is atrial enlargement resulting from heart valve lesions that prevent the atria from emptying adequately into the ventricles, or from ventricular failure with excess damming of blood in the atria. the dilated atrial walls provide ideal conditions of along conductive pathway as well as slow conduction, both of which predispose to atrial fibrillation.\nFor the same reasons that the ventricle will not pump blood during ventricle fibrillation. Neither do the atria pump blood in atrial fibrillation. therefore, the atria become useless as primer pumps for the ventricles. Even so, blood flow passively through the atria into the ventricles, and the efficiency of ventricular pumping is decreased only 20-30 percent. Therefore, in contrast to the lethality of ventricular fibrillation, a person can live for months or even years with atrial fibrillation, although at reduced efficiency of overall heart pumping.<\/p>\n\n<p>numerous small depolarization waves spread in all directions through the atria during atrial fibrillation. Because the waves are weak and many of them are opposite polarity at any given time, they usually almost completely electrically neutralize one another. Therefore, in the electrocardiography, one can see either no P waves from the atria or only a fine, high-frequently, very low voltage wavy record. conversely, the QRS-T complexes are normal unless there is some pathology of the ventricles, but their timing is irregular.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/seiZX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9nxVD.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":27565,"question_id":17498,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17498/what-is-atrial-fibrillation","last_activity_date":1420962621,"creation_date":1400423702,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is atrial fibrillation?","body":"<p>I am wondering exactly what a-fib is (causes and symptoms).\n<p>\nI would really appreciate having a sample of an EKG with it (because in my limited research, I have found it nearly impossible to find just a sample piece of an EKG that has a-fib on it) with your answer, so I can actually get an idea of what it looks like.

Essentially, what you are doing is uniformly distributing the regulator among the available mRNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that even when using Hill functions to model transcription, the ratio of transcription factor (TF) concentration to the number of TF binding sites must be large - otherwise, you would have to consider binding ratios even at the level of transcription modeling, similarly to what you are doing now for translation. E.g. consider a hypothetical situation where 10 TF molecules compete for binding to 5 different promoter regions, each having 10 binding site repeats - you need to somehow distribute the available 10 TF molecules among 50 target binding sites. Clearly, this is not something accounted for by the standard Hill equation, which would in such case wrongly assume that 10 TF molecules are regulating each construct.<\/p>\n\n<p>In your specific case, introducing the ratio of the regulator per each mRNA may not even be necessary if this ratio is large, effectively leading to saturation levels anyway. Note that the maximum level that $m_x$ can reach (at steady state) is equal to $max(m_X) = \\frac{\\alpha_{mX}}{\\beta_{mX}}$. If you can ensure this value to be much smaller than your translational regulator concentration, you will get similar results even if you use simply $\\frac{K}{K+R}$ for translation modeling.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the latter assumption cannot be made, then your reasoning makes sense. For each individual mRNA molecule:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\text{X produced per mRNA} = \\alpha_{X} .\\frac{K}{K+R'}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $R'$ is the amount of mRNA bound to this molecule. If $R$ is the total available regulator concentration and uniform binding affinity is assumed, this means that $R'=\\frac{R}{m_X}$. Summing this over a total of $m_X$ mRNA and considering degradation yields exactly your final ODE.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that another important assumption you are making is that regulator binding/unbinding to/from mRNA is fast compared to translation, and that no cooperative interactions are present.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to verify things further, you could establish system reactions, then derive Hill-free ODE equations according to the law of mass action.

A nerve is a collection of axons (with each axon a part of an individual neuron) in the peripheral nervous system. Thus, when you mention \u201csingle long axon such as the sciatic nerve\u201d, this is technically an incorrect phrase as the sciatic nerve is a collection of many long axons. If one of these axons is nonfunctional, this would not severely affect the function of the entire sciatic nerve. However, you are right that if the entire sciatic nerve is severed, then there would be serious consequences downstream. <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, the primary advantage of conduction velocity is less dependent on length and more dependent on presence and degree of myelination (directly proportional to fiber diameter) and presence of nodes of Ranvier. <\/p>\n\n<p>With regards to the content of your question, the advantage of length is exactly what one might think--- greater distance. The sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in the body in order for our nervous system to innervate as far as the tip of our toes. Having hundreds of side-by-side series of neurons compared to hundreds of side-by-side axons seems like a far less efficient system in a couple of ways in exactly the two ways you mention: energy and time. <\/p>\n\n<p>Energy: Having serial neurons would require an increase the number of neurons needed to transmit a message. Having more neurons requires more Na+, K+ and Na/K pumps and individual channels, requiring more energy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Time: Having serial neurons would also require an increase in the number of synapses between neurons\u2014 either electrical or chemical. If the synapses are chemical, then time is increased many-many fold. If the synapses are electrical, then time is slightly increased by 10-fold per synapse compared to chemical synapses, but this would still take more time compared to having a single axon with myelination and nodes of Ranvier which by about 100-fold faster than a single electrical synapse. <\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, having longer nerves made up of axons rather than serial neurons is beneficial by improving energy and time efficiency, which allows our bodies to effectively innervate structures farther away.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ref: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Regarding delay of conduction: Chemical v.

I haven't been able to find studies which compare ATPase concentration in the soma compared to nodes of Ranvier within axons. <\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding energy use in soma vs axon, mitochondria are not only made in the soma but are concentrated in pre- and post-synaptic membranes (and growth cones). The more of these structures there are (as in serial neurons), the more presumed mitochondria.

For discussions and speculations please comment in the chat.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The basic question is what is the advantage of having a single long axon such as that of sciatic nerve (~1m) compared to a series of neurons? <\/p>\n\n<p>The primary advantage is surely the conduction speed which will get affected because of chemical synapses. However, gap junction synapses can reduce that delay. The larger volume of the soma of the post synaptic neuron may also reduce the conduction speed, but signal strengthening can also happen. Cell architecture can be adjusted to minimize the loss of speed.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The obvious disadvantage of having a single large cell is that there would be tremendous burden on the nucleus for the cellular maintenance. There would be delays in transfer of non-electrical signals such as biomolecules from axon termini to soma and vice versa. Long axons also means continuous transport along them which in turn demands large number of molecular motors and therefore ATP. Moreover, a small injury can disable the entire conduction channel. It can be imagined that this trait (long axons) can also be selected against; injury leading to inability to move and thereby causing perishment. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong> (<em>Based on comments to Anne's answer<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Time is of course a valid advantage for having a single axon as an information conduction channel. However, the energy or the maintenance cost is the factor that I am actually interested in. Maintenance cost would increase with cell volume (in fact surface area) and having serial neurons would demand more energy (cumulative) than a single axon (including costs of maintaining a nucleus). However a long cell would need much higher number of molecular motors to maintain the traffic flow rate. All responses that require transcriptional control would be slow (such as response to injury). Moreover a single soma also imposes a limit on the number of mitochondria. There should be a limit on how long an axon can be. I am especially interested in case of big animals (with long hindlimbs) that also have a good reflex (perhaps camels, even horses). <\/p>\n\n<p>Has someone tried to analyse the tradeoffs of having a long axon vs series of neurons connected by gap junctions?

What I ask from anyone who reads this is to recognize that these companies are the bad apples in Chinese companies and you shall not generalize all Chinese biotech companies. Generalization, not a good thing, and I trust all the years of training in scientific critical thinking has taught you better :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now how do these companies make fake ELISA kits? Simple.

Run a western using a trusted third party antibody. If nothing shows up, you know the standard is not what they claim it is. Or you can also run a third party recombinant protein on the kit.

These companies are literally like Noah's Ark. How can one company you never heard of come up with so many ELISA kits while established companies who have been making kits for decades are dangling on the level of hundreds or thousands? <\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe, one thinks, that someone went hard core and just made them all, that maybe this is real? After all there are no other choices, they are the only ones selling this ELISA kit, wouldn't hurt too much to give it a try...?? \nAnd that is why these companies still exist today. That is why so many papers got pulled, and so many clinically promising indications turned out to be false. That is what cost millions of dollars of tax payers money. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the end I want to point out that, if researchers did their due diligence, or if there are some more effective forms of media where researchers can get information like this, these companies would have died a decade ago.

As said above, ICD and SNOMED CT going to have codes for your diseases and symptoms. I'd lean toward SNOMED CT due to the way it organises concepts. Essentially from broad to specific. That way users can enter very specific symptoms, and your matrix only needs to have symptoms as specific as is required.\nFor example you can say \"vomitting\" is a symptom of \"alcohol poisoning\" in your db. And if a user enters \"projectile vomitting\" the SNOMED structure recognises this as a type of vomitting.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>However<\/strong> - Symptoms don't make the disease, and most diseases have a huge array of 'possible symptoms' (Which is why SNOMED CT doesn't have such relationships).

To understand why this occurs we have to understand their mating system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Males have harem of females and males fight in order to access a harem (Note: females may also take part in the battle depending of which male they prefer). When a male takes over a new harem, he kills the youngs of the previous male if these youngs are still dependent on their mother. The reasons are:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The mother is not fertile while she is taking care of a young baby while the male would appreciate that the female is ready to raise his own kids.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The mother need to invest quite a lot of energy to feed/milk their youngs while the new male would prefer this energy to be invested in his own offspring.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In short, a male kills the youngs when he takes over a new harem because these youngs do not carry his genes and prevent this new male to optimally pass on his own genes as the offsprings of the previous male consume time and energy from the females of the harem.<\/p>\n\n<p>And well\u2026 once the offsprings are killed, it would be a shame to waste all this good and fresh meat.

Chimpanzees eating other chimpanzees and bears eating other bears. In the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_salamander\" rel=\"nofollow\">tiger salamander<\/a>, there are cannibal morph and normal morphs. In this species cannibalism is very frequent as in nature one offspring over 5 is eaten through cannibalism (if I am not mistaken). Cannibalism is very common in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_dog\" rel=\"nofollow\">prairie dogs<\/a> as well (<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/230/4729/1037.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a>). In Dragonflies cannibalism represents 95% of the total mortality (<a href=\"http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Polis1981.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Sibling sharks eat each others in their mum's womb. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrqgPjZ07Ts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is a video on the subject. This type of cannibalism is called siblicide.<\/p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantodea\" rel=\"nofollow\">Praying mantis<\/a> the female may eat her mate after copulation. This is referred to as <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_cannibalism\" rel=\"nofollow\">sexual cannibalism<\/a><\/em>. The subject is slightly controversial, please have a look to the wiki article for more info.<\/p>\n\n<p>In many species (including the dragonflies example above) the old individuals eat the youngs.

Usually it will 'pop' back in itself or with a little help. Normally this type of dislocation does not need reducing in A&amp;E. It can occur regularly throughout the day and will be associated with certain positions the arm is placed into. This type of dislocation is associated with people that have 'lax' joints, for example people who hyper-extend their knees and elbows and can get the palms of both hands onto the floor with ease.  This joint laxity is normal for these people and the onset of dislocation can be associated with a change in how the muscles around the shoulder are interacting with each other or a change in posture/ position of the arm. This can produce an imbalance in the control of the joint. Referral for appropriate physiotherapy is the initial form of management. The physiotherapist should look at the way in which the muscles and shoulder joint is moving and posture aiming to restore the balance. Treatment can 'cure' the problem as long as the exercises and advice is continued, but in some cases there is only minimal or nil benefit. At this point surgical intervention is indicated. <\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Positional Non-traumatic dislocations. \n  This group of people can dislocate their shoulders without any form or history of trauma. Some may have started out dislocating their shoulder as a party trick; others may have always had shoulders that just 'fall' out of joint. This type of dislocation is usually painless and can be put back in easily. Both shoulders are typically involved. The cause of this type of dislocation is usually a result of what we call 'abnormal muscle patterning' which means the strong muscles around the shoulder joint are not working in the correct order causing them to pull the shoulder out of joint with active movement in the particular direction such as lifting the arm forward above the head or out to the side and above the head.  The main treatment for this is physiotherapy that looks at re-sequencing the muscles in order to prevent further dislocations.  Occasionaly surgery in the form of thermal capsular shrinkage or plication may be neccessary.<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/articletile.asp?article=50&amp;section=12&amp;tile=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> such people would be able to dislocate then get their hands in front and relocate.<\/p>\n\n<p>The body can be trained to be quite flexible through training like gymnastics etc...<\/p>\n","answer_id":27471,"question_id":27468,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27468/is-it-possible-to-move-your-arms-above-your-head-when-handcuffed-in-the-back","last_activity_date":1420713204,"creation_date":1420703815,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is it possible to move your arms above your head when handcuffed in the back?","body":"<p>This move was seen in Pitch Black and i wonder if it is possible at all.

We don't only generate life. If that were true, it might be illegal to flush toilets. Life forms of some kind would occupy all the space in our atmosphere. Babies - or some living things - would rise up from our graves. Conceivably none of the millions/billions of people who have died from the beginning of history (and well before that) would be dead. Add to that animals, and everything in the other Kingdoms included in <em>Life<\/em>, and there would be nothing left perhaps <em>except<\/em> for life. To be honest, life generates heat, death and simple substances much more commonly than it generates life.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you mean, why does <strong>like<\/strong> produce <strong>like<\/strong> (in your case, a life generates a similar life form*, that's because of genetic material. New life is based on the genetic material of the preceding life form. People don't give birth to zebras, zebras do. When the genetic material is damaged enough, we give birth to a non-viable or diseased child. If a mutation is favorable, it is (under the right circumstances) spread through an advantage. An example of this is the appearance of lactase, an enzyme which allows adults to derive continued nutrition from animal milk.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to your second question: why doesn't life continue to be generated on Earth? Are you 100% sure that it isn't happening? How would you recognize a life form foreign to our own? How many different <em>kinds<\/em> of life can evolve under the same planetary conditions, the same planetary element ratios, etc.? If a <em>very rudimentary<\/em> silicon-based life form evolved in, say, the last 2,000,000 years, would you know how to look for it? In other words, are you defining life only as we now know it - a carbon based, DNA-propigated form?<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if a non-carbon based life form could only evolve on <em>this<\/em> planet to a very basic, simple level, would you give credence to it as a newly evolved \"life\" form?

You say <code>[..]evolution is nowadays pretty much analyzed through phylogenetic trees[..]<\/code>. Many evolutionary biologist make extensive use of phylogenetic methods but a good part of evolutionary biologist (most of them I would say) do not work directly with phylogenetic methods.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am not sure I understand your question but I hope the following may help you either to understand the issue or to edit your question. Note that I am NOT a phylogeneticist (not sure this word exist).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the definition of \"Node\" in Phylogenetics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think your definition of a <code>node<\/code> might be unusual. In phylogeny, a node is the most recent common ancestor shared by two sister lineages.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Time in a phylogenetic tree<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Also, when you look at a phylogenetic tree, the axis along which lineages diversify represent the time (real time in years). Now, we use different methods in order to make estimation of this real time such as the rate of neutral substitutions. You may want to read about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock\" rel=\"nofollow\">molecular clock<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>each successive node has taken time to develop?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not sure what you mean by \"develop\" here. Develop usually means the process by which a given individual/organism change phenotypically through its lifetime.

In any case, an average time for a population to acquire a given arbitrary trait is a concept that 1) is valid only for discrete trait, 2) that is very dependent on the kind of trait you want to consider, 3) that will varies a lot from one given trait to another and 4) is extremely dependent on when you consider being the starting point of the evolutionary process toward the creation of the given trait. Therefore, it doesn't makes much sense.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently used \"standard evolutionary time unit\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>However, you can use similar concept for quantitative traits. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(unit)\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Darwin (d)<\/a> is a unit of evolutionary change (invented by Haldane and named after C. Darwin). It is defined as the e-fold (e≈2.7) in a mean of individual's trait in a population over million of years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Haldane is a unit of evolutionary change (I don't know who invented it and it is obviously named after JBS Haldane) and correspond to the number of standard deviation (of the distribution of individual trait in the population) change in the mean of individuals trait in a population per generation. The Haldane unit is therefore dependent on the selection pressure, the additive and non-additive genetic variance and environmental variance (therefore the heritability) and the mutational pressures.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26259,"question_id":26255,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1420672659},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8b41b17537f38c6f0523ca2dad02c4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":784,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/784/tel","reputation":2829,"display_name":"tel","accept_rate":80},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1419870268,"creation_date":1419870268,"body":"<p>Something like what you describe does exist, and is called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock\" rel=\"nofollow\">molecular clock<\/a>.

Because systematists describing fossil species (usually) only have skeletons, they compare to other fossils. You are correct that diagnosing a species from only a skeleton can be tricky. What defines what you call a genus, a species, etc.? How morphologically <em>dis<\/em>similar can two skeletons be before you call them different species? The running joke is that if you found fossils of a chihuahua skeleton and a great dane skeleton, you would certainly call them different species. But by modern biological species concepts, they are the same species. Then there are extant species that are essentially indistinguishable in terms of their skeletons, but do not interbreed, and so are probably different species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes there is consensus, and sometimes there is not. This disagreement can lead to a description of a new species by one person being reclassified (\"revised\" is the term used) as another species. There are lots of examples of this among dinosaurs. Most famously, <em>Brontosaurus<\/em> was revised as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed\" rel=\"nofollow\">actually being Apatosaurus<\/a>. More recently, and relevant to your question, <em><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/montanas-dueling-dinosaurs-134669023/?no-ist=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nanotyrannus<\/a><\/em> is thought by some to be a juvenile <em>Tyrannosaurus rex<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So then how did Fiorillo and Tykowski, who described <em>Nanuqsaurus hoglundi<\/em>, decide that it was (1) not just a juvenile T. rex and (2) that it was a new species? Their rationale is laid out really well in their paper, primarily in the sections \"Diagnosis\" and \"Description\". You rightly picked out the two questions that paleontologists reading this paper would want to know.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> is not a juvenile:<\/h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The dorsomedial edge of the maxilla is marked by deep pockets separated by pronounced transverse ridges. These together formed a strong peg-in-socket articulation between the dorsal margin of the maxilla and the ventrolateral edge of the nasal. The same kind of deeply interlocking naso-maxillary contact is a well-documented character that is also present only in developmentally mature individuals of the derived tyrannosaurines <em>Daspletosaurus torosus<\/em>, <em>Tarbosaurus bataar<\/em>, and <em>Tyrannosaurus rex<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>, [6], [20], [21], [22]. The nasal-maxilla contact is either smoothly grooved or bears only weak scalloping in immature individuals and more basal tyrannosauroids <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>, [6]. The presence of this feature in DMNH 21461 is evidence that the material also represents a developmentally mature individual.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What they are saying here is that maxilla (part of the front of the upper jaw) in <em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> has a very characteristic relationship to the nasal bone in which they form a peg-and-socket joint. This relationship is found in tyrannosaurine dinosaurs like <em>Tyrannosaurus<\/em>, <em>Daspletosaurus<\/em>, and <em>Tarbosaurus<\/em>. But more importantly, it is only found in adult tyrannosaurines. So they conclude that <em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> is an adult.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> is a distinct species from <em>Tyrannosaurus<\/em> and other tyrannosaurines<\/h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In all three hypotheses of phylogeny, <em>Nanuqsaurus hoglundi<\/em> was found to be a derived tyrannosaurine, the sister taxon to the <em>Tarbosaurus<\/em> + <em>Tyrannosaurus<\/em> clade (Figure 6). This node was supported by a single unambiguous character, the presence of a dorsoventrally tall, paired sagittal crest on the frontal. The age of <em>Nanuqsaurus hoglundi<\/em> (70-69Ma) is consistent with its place in the recovered hypothesis of tyrannosauroid phylogeny, positioned in time between the more basal <em>Daspletosaurus torosus<\/em> (Middle to Late Campanian) and the more derived <em>Tyrannosaurus rex<\/em> (latest Maastrichtian) among other North American tyrannosaurines.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The authors ran a phylogenetic analysis of characters coded for <em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> and about 20 other taxa. <em>Nanuqsaurus<\/em> has enough shared characteristics to put to solidly among tyrannosaurine (near <em>Tyrannosaurus<\/em>, <em>Daspletosaurus<\/em>, and <em>Tarbosaurus<\/em>). But, importantly, it has a characteristic that none of these others have: \"the presence of a dorsoventrally tall, paired sagittal crest on the frontal.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on its being an adult and having a character that is not found anywhere else among tyrannosaurines, Fiorillo and Tykowski name a new species. I'm simplifying what they did, but that's the general idea. To their credit, they acknowledge that there is not a lot distinguishing the new species and discuss in much more detail their rationale and the implications of their results. <\/p>\n","answer_id":15725,"question_id":15708,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1420666392}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15708/how-to-determine-whether-a-newly-discovered-dinosaur-is-not-a-young-one-and-not","last_activity_date":1420666392,"creation_date":1394741460,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to determine whether a newly discovered dinosaur is not a young one and not an entirely different species?","body":"<p>Every once in a while, there is an official announce that a new species has been discovered.

We don't know exactly why or where time perception exists, but we do have some information on how it is perceived.<\/p>\n\n<p>The circadian rhythm is basically in place to help us sleep, wake and perform tasks in a 24 hour cycle of light. Robbed of light, and the melatonin it's absence produces, the rhythm shifts considerably.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vision is a powerful cue for the passage of time. Bees have an extremely sophisticated ability to predict the sun's location at a given moment (they can count the moments). While I doubt the same is true for humans, our eyes give us a great deal of information about the passage of time: the time in a 24 hour period (the position of the sun, moon, stars, shadows, etc), and the time in a year, the time in a lifetime. Witnessing the passage of time, according to physicist Paul Davies, we observe how the <em>\u201clater states of the world differ from earlier states that we still remember.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Besides the important input from our eyes and memories, we also have internal timekeepers.  A study decades ago on short order cooks (I can't seem to find it) found that an experienced cook can keep internal time to the second, and can keep multiple \"stopwatches\" going in his head: the scrambled eggs, the toast, the pancakes, the grilled cheese sandwiches all take a certain amount of time, and short order cooks can tell when that time has passed with extraordinary precision.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that the fluids flow at different rates tells us that we perceive time differently under different circumstances. Time perception is surprisingly prone to measurable distortions and illusions. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The importance of our temporal experiences for daily living is strikingly documented in individual neurological cases where patients report of an accelerated progression of time and, consequently, have troubles in adequately interacting with the environment, i.e. driving a car. Psychological research has shown that cognitive functions such as attention, working memory as well as long-term memory determine our temporal judgements. Moreover, drive states, moods and emotions, as well as factors of personality influence duration estimates. For example, time intervals are judged to be longer when we pay more attention to time and when the load of varying experiences stored in memory is higher. Our subjective well-being also strongly influences how time is experienced. Time speeds up when we are involved in pleasant activities, but it drags during periods of boredom. Thus, our sense of time is a function of the intricate interplay between specific cognitive functions and of our momentary mood states.<sup>[1]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Where exactly time is perceived by the brain is unknown, but several areas keep appearing, most prominently, the cerebellum, the right posterior parietal cortex, the right prefrontal cortex, as well as <em>fronto-striatal circuits<\/em>. All have been implicated as the neural substrates of a potential timekeeping mechanism. The inner experience of time<sup>[1]<\/sup> gives a broad overview. The conclusion is worth reading.<\/p>\n\n<p>To further support that the <em>where<\/em> is not known, consider the following:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Studies done in humans also support the hypothesis that <em>striatum<\/em> and its afferents are involved in interval timing. Recent fMRI data showed that timing network could involve cortico-striatal loops, including premotor and supplementary motor areas, frontal operculum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and temporal and parietal cortices, as well as the putamen. Imaging studies in humans, lesion studies in humans and rodents, and drug studies in rodents all point towards a central role of the <em>basal ganglia<\/em> in interval timing. The anatomy of the basal ganglia suggests that information is proceeded through <em>cortico-striato-thalamic loops<\/em>. Severe deficiencies in reproducing temporal intervals were also found in Parkinson\u2019s patients, therefore, further supporting the hypothesis of basal ganglia involvement in interval timing. There are also lesions data suggesting that the timing network is much widely distributed. Lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, a cholinergic nucleus in the basal forebrain with projections to the frontal cortex, induced a progressive, proportional, delay in peak time response (memory pattern). This effect is believed to be related to altered temporal memories [42,43] due to change in acetylcholine (ACh) level. Lesions of the frontal cortex produce similar memory patterns, whereas lesions of the hippocampus or fimbria fornix, a basal forebrain cholinergic nucleus with projections to the hippocampus, result in memory effects translated into an advance of the peak time response. These experimental findings undoubtedly support the hypothesis of a distributed interval timing neural network.<sup>[2]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For a fun but non-scientific look at time, the NYT has written an understandable article.<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>The final answer is that no one knows for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Experience and Perception of Time<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>1 <a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1525/1955\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inner experience of time<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>2 <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3751097\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>3 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/health/05mind.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Where Did the Time Go?

How much blood does a mosquito take when feeding?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is not so easy to answer, but there are publications which measure the volume of different mosquito species. Reference 1 lists volumes between 2.85 and 11.99µL per meal and mosquito. Reference 2 lists 3.07 and 5.71µL. To make the approximation a bit easier, let's assume that mosquitoes drink about 5µL per bite (which should be near enough).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How much blood does a human have?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume\">Wikipedia<\/a>, humans have around 77mL blood per kilogram of body weight. If we take a 70kg human, we get around 5L of blood.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How many mosquitos does it take to get a human into shock, and how many to suck him out completely?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to the Medline, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000167.htm\">Hypovolemic shock<\/a> occurs when a human loses about 1/5 (or more) of his blood volume. 1/5th of 5L is one litre. Since each mosquito sucks 5µL, this would take about 200.000 mosquitoes. To suck out all blood would take 1 million mosquitoes. (This is not possible since mosquitoes depend on an existing blood pressure, as reference 3 shows. If a capillary is empty due to massive blood sucking, they change to another.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides this theoretical (but interesting) calculation, there are some real problems about getting biten by so many mosquitos. First, this is a question of available skin. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin#Skin_components\">human skin<\/a> is about 2 square meters in size, which would require 100.000 bites per square meter. To break this down further, a square meter has 10.000 square centimeters, so there would be 10 mosquitos which need to bite you per square centimeter. Rather unlikely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then each mosquito injects a mix of anti-coagulants, pain killers etc. prior to sucking to keep the blood from clotting and also to make sure you won't notice the bite immediately. As pointed out in the comments, this would already cause a lot of trouble and probably cause massive bleeding, since the effect of the anti-coagulants would sum up when biten by thousands of mosquitos. Additionally the body reacts by releasing histamines and since the amount would also be massive, this would cause real trouble and probably kill you.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3858/k7varb48_pdf.htm\">Regulation of blood meal size in the mosquito<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551617/\">La Crosse Virus Infection Alters Blood Feeding Behavior in Aedes\ntriseriatus and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0050464\">Visualizing Non Infectious and Infectious Anopheles gambiae Blood\nFeedings in Naive and Saliva-Immunized Mice<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr>\n","answer_id":26414,"question_id":26413,"up_vote_count":45,"last_edit_date":1420633825}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26413/how-many-mosquitoes-would-it-take-to-drain-enough-blood-to-put-a-person-into-s","last_activity_date":1420633825,"creation_date":1420493646,"answer_count":1,"title":"How many mosquitoes would it take to \"drain\" enough blood to put a person into shock?","body":"<p>I'm just curious, how many mosquito \"bites\" (mosquitoes which have removed blood from a person) would it take to remove enough blood to put a person into shock?

Indeed, the constant (Fc) tail of the antibody is where other proteins involved in immune responses typically bind, most notably the Fc receptors (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n4/full/nm0400_443.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clynes et al., 2000<\/a>) found on immune cells such as B lymphocytes. Fc receptors mediate the recruitment of immune cells to a site of infection. The primary role of the Fab region is antigen binding as it contains the highly variable antigen binding domain.

In ADCC, the Fc region of an antibody binds to Fc receptors (FcγRs) on the surface of immune effector cells such as natural killers and macrophages, leading to the phagocytosis or lysis of the targeted cells.

However, the constant regions in Fab (CL) may also provide binding sites for other proteins and indeed some bacterial compounds are known to bind to this region (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7927988\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bouvet, 1994<\/a>).

The benefit of a sixth (or seventh, or eighth) finger on the other hand is probably pretty minimal (diminishing returns)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqmsR.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5563,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5563/shadow-wizard","reputation":258,"display_name":"Shadow Wizard"},"score":0,"post_id":23976,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e757934cd08da0be2cc08517e86e2cab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10181,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10181/matt-burland","reputation":101,"display_name":"Matt Burland"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1416001174,"comment_id":38127,"body":"@Matt interesting, if you can elaborate with scientific quotes this might make a fair answer as well. :)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqmsR.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5563,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5563/shadow-wizard","reputation":258,"display_name":"Shadow Wizard"},"score":0,"post_id":23976,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DNPz8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11841,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11841/one-face","reputation":2241,"display_name":"One Face","accept_rate":73},"edited":false,"creation_date":1420569536,"comment_id":42794,"body":"@CRags wrong site for this. :)"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":14,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb89ee689525b9add6f4961442f4f5db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6433,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6433/nit","reputation":171,"display_name":"Nit"},"score":3,"post_id":23979,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415904857,"comment_id":38050,"body":"How do more digits impair locomotion?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e757934cd08da0be2cc08517e86e2cab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10181,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10181/matt-burland","reputation":101,"display_name":"Matt Burland"},"score":1,"post_id":23979,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb89ee689525b9add6f4961442f4f5db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6433,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6433/nit","reputation":171,"display_name":"Nit"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1415914859,"comment_id":38056,"body":"@Nit: You need to coordinate all those digits as you walk making the process more complicated."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bee37ff3471620d9a17e619e022b547d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1061,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1061/emanuele","reputation":270,"display_name":"emanuele"},"score":0,"post_id":23979,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458589288,"comment_id":77515,"body":"So, why we do not have three fingers?"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1420547492,"creation_date":1415880840,"body":"<p>I found an interesting article in Scientific American (<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-most-species-have/\">Coates, 2005<\/a>), and I quote part of it:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The condition of having no more than five fingers or toes [...] probably evolved before the evolutionary divergence of amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders and caecilians) and amniotes (birds, mammals, and reptiles in the loosest sense of the term).

Prior to this split, there is evidence of tetrapods from about 360 million years ago having limbs bearing arrays of six, seven and eight digits.

Losing things in evolution is generally relatively simple, yet re-gaining them is hard.

However, I think some of the examples should be relevant to refine your question.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One thing that I find vague in this question is what exactly constitutes a \"process\"/\"function\"? To me, this can be almost anything. You seem to be focusing on molecular biology and biological pathways, but I think it is just as reasonable to think in terms of large scale processes. If so, there are lots of processes that seem valid in my mind, relating to e.g. reproduction and dispersal. <\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, in primitive plants (and other taxa) fertilization is external and dependent on environmental moisture to transport gametes. Organisms with internal fertilization has bypassed this by providing their own mechanism for fertilization, which does not depend on environmental processes (to the same extent). The evolutionary forces behind this was maybe/probably that it was more efficient and allowed colonization of new environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another similar example is seed dispersal in plants, where some are wind dispersed (\"primitive\" state) and others use active measures to eject seeds (ballochory). By doing this they have bypassed the dependence of wind to disperse their seeds. The same kinds of mechanisms can also be found in groups of mosses. <\/p>\n\n<p>In both these cases a function that was previously external and environmentally mediated is now provided by the organisms themselves, and they involve quite complicated morphological and anatomical adaptations. Do you find them valid for your question? These are just two examples, but there are lots of similar cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>More in the line of comments to your question, I think you should provide one or two references to the hypothesis you are referring to (i.e. where it has been used/discussed), which would make it easier to understand exactly what you are after (and also provide an entry into the literature). This could maybe also help explain why the \"<em>...evolved solution 'echoes' the one provided by the environment<\/em>\". At the moment I don't understand at all why this should be the case in general. Adaptive evolution happen because of selection that acts on differences in fitness, and it is indifferent to whether the mechanism echoes a previous solution to a similar problem (except for the fact that evolution is constrained by the evolutionary history of organisms).<\/p>\n","answer_id":26393,"question_id":26274,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"post_id":26405,"edited":false,"creation_date":1420470097,"comment_id":42696,"body":"I apologize if it is unsuitable to post this as a separate answer, instead of adding it to my previous answer/comment as an edit.

In terms of your RNA-example, it was not enought to evolve the ability to synthesize any complex molecule that could function as an enzyme and information carrier, but had to be RNA since this was already used in the biological pathways of the primitive organism. <\/p>\n\n<p>With this in mind I think that you should look closely at vitamins (or other essential nutrients) for evidence of similar processes. The key think about vitamins is that they are often large complex molecules that are vital nutrients and the ability to synthesize vitamins differs widely between taxa. In a sense, the nucleotides were essential nutrients for the organisms in the proposed RNA-world, so vitamins/essential nutrients should be a relevant analog to look for similar evolutionary processes. However, keep in mind that molecular biology is not at all my field, and I might be mistaken on some aspects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take the example of <strong>Vitamin C<\/strong>. This cannot be synthezised by humans, but by most other mammals (vitamin C synthesis is considered ancestral in mammals). It can also be synthesized by plants, yeast and many other animals. However, vitamin C is used in different ways in different organisms. Plants use it e.g. for photosynthesis, photoprotection, cell wall growth and in the synthesis of plant hormones, while humans and other mammals use it as enzyme cofactors and for immune responses. Another key aspect is that plants, yeast and animals all use different pathways to synthezise vitamin C (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145266/#R2\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Drouin et al. 2011. The Genetics of Vitamin C Loss in Vertebrates. Curr Genomics 12(5): 371\u2013378.\">Drouin et al, 2011<\/a>), which indicates that the synthesis of vitamin C is not ancestral to all these taxa (i.e. not an ancestral feature of all eukaryotic life). In mammals, the synthesis of vitamin C has also switched between organs multiple times, which also indicates novel adaptations that results in the same molecule. <\/p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems very likely that vitamin C was initially obtained by animals from plants (which have very high concentrations of vitamin C) as part of their diet (i.e. environmentally provided) and became an essential component in many biological pathways. If this is the case, animals later gained the ability to synthesize vitamin C themselves, using a different biological pathway than plants. This feature has later been secondarily lost (e.g. humans and teleost fish) and regained multiple times in different taxa. However, this is speculation on my part, and I don't know this literature well enought to say if there are studies on the origin of vitamin C synthesis in animals, or if the pathways of vitamin C synthesis in plants and animals are fundamentally related.

Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology 52: 437-467\">Smirnoff et al (2001)<\/a> indicates that there are some similarities between the enzymes involved in the final stages of vitamin C synthesis:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gene and/or cDNAs encoding GalLDH, GulLO, and AraLO have been isolated and described from several organisms including cauliflower, sweet potato (GalLDH, 54, 121), rat (GulLO, 70), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (53). In addition, complete nucleotide coding sequences of the A. thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum GalLDH genes (Accession No. AB042279.1, AB024527.1), and the Candida albicans AraLO gene (Accession No. AF031228) have been submitted directly to GenBank and associated databases. The predicted amino acid sequences of these related proteins share substantial amounts of identity. The mature cauliflower GalLDH amino acid sequence shares 28% overall identity with the rat GulLO and 26% identity with the Candida albicans AraLO (using the J Hein method with PAM250 residue weight table).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the synthesis of vitamin C is ancestral to both plants and animals. I haven't been able to find any papers on the origin of vitamin C synthesis, and if there is evidence that it is ancestral to all modern life. <\/p>\n\n<p>In either case, I think it could be useful for you to look closely at vitamins in animals or other organisms for possible examples of the type of processes you are looking for, since they are (by definition) essential nutrients that some animals can and others cannot synthesize. They should therefore be good potential targets to find similar processes as your RNA-example. <em>Vitamin B12<\/em> is an extreme to the other end, since it is essential for most animals but can only be synthesized by bacteria (so the main source is through bacterial symbiosis).<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also possible that I'm mistaken, and that synthesis of all vitamins is ancestral to modern life, and that there has only been subsequent loss of the ability to synthesize certain vitamins/nutrients. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016895251300053X#\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Helliwell et al. 2013.

Yet, their biosynthetic pathways appear to have arisen via the patchwork model of pathway evolution [31], resulting in the recruitment of unrelated proteins in any one pathway. Indeed, many vitamins are synthesized by different routes in different organisms [20]. For example, alternative pathways are found for thiamine biosynthesis in prokaryotes and among different eukaryotes (Figure 2) [20]. Despite this diversity in biosynthetic pathways, there appear to be common trends in the causes and mechanisms underlying pathway loss.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":26405,"question_id":26274,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1420536932}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26274/are-there-known-examples-where-an-evolved-mechanism-echoes-one-originally-prov","last_activity_date":1420536932,"creation_date":1419907399,"answer_count":4,"title":"Are there known examples where an evolved mechanism \"echoes\" one originally provided by the environment?","body":"<h2>Short summary<\/h2>\n\n<p>I am a researcher in origins of life, a field that deals with hypotheses about evolutionary processes that took place before LUCA (the last universal common ancestor), and with the chemical processes that gave rise to life and evolution in the first place. This is very hard to study empirically, and as a consequence there are many competing hypotheses. However, I've noticed that many of them have a common form, which I will describe below. My question is about whether hypotheses of this particular form exist (and have been investigated, for example using phylogenetic methods) in post-LUCA evolutionary biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>My reason for asking is that my colleagues and I were not able to think of a good example. If no example is known in post-LUCA evolutionary biology then it casts doubt on the plausibility of this type of hypothesis in pre-LUCA evolution. I suspect this is the case, and therefore my ideal answer would provide me with bibliographic material to support a claim that there just aren't any good examples of this in evolutionary biology. However, I would also be happy to be proven wrong with a really good example.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Longer explanation<\/h2>\n\n<p>Hypotheses regarding the origins of life are difficult to test empirically, because phylogenetic methods can give us little direct evidence about anything before LUCA, and because there are no fossils dating from that time. (The entirety of Earth's surface has since been replaced by plate tectonics.) Consequently there are a number of competing hypotheses that differ from one another in almost every way. However, I've noticed that many of them have a common form: they say that <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>one or more of the features of a modern (i.e. post-LUCA) cell were originally provided by an external mechanism, in the form of abiotic chemical processes that took place in some very specific microenvironment, and<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>evolution eventually provided a solution that very closely echoed the one that had originally been provided by the environment.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Point (1) seems relatively easy to satisfy in an evolutionary scenario; it's point (2) that I'm specifically interested in. The two most popular hypotheses in the field both have this form:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some forms of the The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">RNA-World hypothesis<\/a> hold that originally, RNA nucleotides were produced by purely chemical processes in the environment, and that life evolved from self-replicating RNA molecules made up from these abiotically-produced monomers. Later, life evolved a cellular metabolism by which it could construct its own RNA monomers. This satisfies point (2) because it says that the environment provided RNA rather than some other heteropolymer with catalytic properties; the evolutionary solution echoes the environmental one in that it uses the same complex molecule.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Wächterschäuser's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93sulfur_world_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron-Sulphur World<\/a> theory, and many of its descendants, including Russel's <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442388/\" rel=\"nofollow\">alkaline vent theory<\/a>, hold that the reductive tricarbolic acid cycle (rTCA cycle, aka reverse citric acid cycle) was originally catalysed by mineral surfaces. This enabled the formation of the first cells, which eventually evolved enzymes that could be used to catalyse the rTCA cycle without the mineral catalysts. This satisfies point (2) because it says that the first evolved solution used essentially the same chemical pathway as the one provided by the environment, just with different catalysts.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>(Not all hypotheses in origins of life have this form. Some versions of the RNA World theory hold that RNA-based life was preceded by life based on some other heteropolymer, for example. But the hypotheses described above are very popular.)<\/p>\n\n<p>From an evolutionary biology point of view, point (2) seems rather an odd feature for a hypothesis to have. Evolution is great at producing novel solutions to problems, but to my knowledge it isn't good at copying old ones. (Mimicry doesn't provide a counterexample to this, since it's about appearance rather than mechanism, and often the mimic produces the same visual effect through a very different mechanism. For example, although the treehopper Cyphonia clavata mimics the outward appearance of an ant, it does so not by being anatomically similar to an ant but by <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211004222\" rel=\"nofollow\">having a face on its butt<\/a>.) <\/p>\n\n<p>Consequently I'm looking for known examples from evolutionary biology that satisfy both point (1) and point (2). That is, I'm looking for examples where a species originally relied on some relatively complex process in its environment, and became less dependent on its environment <em>by evolving a mechanism that closely echoes the one originally provided by the environment<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example that might fit the bill would be a species that was originally unable to produce a key metabolite (e.g. an amino acid), but then later evolved the ability to produce the metabolite for itself. Evidence for this might be constituted by finding a species that produces the metabolite using a novel set of proteins, indicating that the capability to produce the metabolite was lost and then re-evolved. It would make an even better example if the novel proteins catalyse substantially the same chemical pathway that other species use to produce the same metabolite.<\/p>\n\n<p>It may be that no good examples of this exist, which is actually better for me than if they do. More than any particular example, the main thing I want to know is whether ideas along these lines have been discussed in evolutionary biology at all (perhaps outside the context of the origins of life), and if so where I can find the literature on it.<\/p>\n","question_id":26274,"tags":["evolution","abiogenesis"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":194,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1420429207},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba24be6cdb3a8fa551e4148aad56055b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":11826,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11826/user16901","reputation":11,"display_name":"user16901"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIiWG.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8059/macedon93","reputation":124,"display_name":"Macedon93","accept_rate":67},"score":1,"post_id":26389,"edited":false,"creation_date":1420404743,"comment_id":42650,"body":"I believe you are going to have to either elaborate on your question greatly and put forth some effort in specifics of what you are asking"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba24be6cdb3a8fa551e4148aad56055b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":11826,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11826/user16901","reputation":11,"display_name":"user16901"},"score":1,"post_id":26389,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIiWG.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8059/macedon93","reputation":124,"display_name":"Macedon93","accept_rate":67},"edited":false,"creation_date":1420406441,"comment_id":42651,"body":"photosynthesis has 2 phases.the first one is made in light,were oxygen is produced(i know this phase cause is easier and my teacher has it very good explained).The second phase is made in dark,were dioxide carbon is produced,but i don&#39;t know why and how.that&#39;s why i asked..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIiWG.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8059/macedon93","reputation":124,"display_name":"Macedon93","accept_rate":67},"score":2,"post_id":26389,"edited":false,"creation_date":1420406652,"comment_id":42652,"body":"There are more than enough resources you can seek online to find the answer.

Since proteins mediate nearly all biochemical transformations and therefore mediate life's processes, protein folding one of the great unsolved problems in science today. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can see in the example folded structure above there are helices and flat sheets of connected strands.  You can see below in the schematic alpha beta barrel motif of triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) how elegant these structures can be.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sy3y7.png\" alt=\"the TIM alpha beta barrel\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Although the combinations and overall organization of the beta sheets and the alpha helices are boundless, there are some unifying motifs in these structures. <\/p>\n\n<p>Long ago, a couple of researchers tabulated the amino acids probability of being in alpha helices or beta strands.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chou%E2%80%93Fasman_method\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chou-Fasman model<\/a> is important in that it has approximately ~70% chance of detecting alpha helices and beta strands.  Its not a great accuracy but what's really amazing about these algorithms is that they show that local forces - the interaction of amino acids near each other in the sequence have something to do with the formation of at least alpha-helices and beta strands. <\/p>\n\n<p>There have been pounds worth of papers written since then.  In general, statistical surveys of protein sequences have been able to identify folds or motifs by a long list of string and machine learning algorithms.  Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian profiles are popular. Of course all these are similar to Chou-Fasman in that they work on the sequence in short segments more or less.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For a while it was thought that molecular dynamics and other discrete simulations might help to solve protein folding by allowing long distance interactions to be involved.  Just simulating the entire protein molecule in a computer program as it moves into a folded conformation, but this has not proven to be possible for a couple of reasons: (1) it takes a long time for a protein to fold relative to the length of a tractable simulation (2) the forces involved in protein folding and molecular size scales are not really easy to simulate - they do not precisely simulate the forces and behavior experienced by molecules and they involve many more solvent molecules than most computations can involve - even today's server farms would get clogged up with respectable protein folding simulation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since 1994 the <a href=\"http://predictioncenter.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)<\/a> have provided an open competition every 2 years where 3D structures that have been determined experimentally is held from publication.  While its well attended <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6782/abs/405039a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new class of algorithms showed up around 2000<\/a>.  These algorithms work on the assumption that local forces are important to protein folding, but often incorporating molecular dynamics.  Using MD or statistics based on protein structures (see the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">RCSB<\/a> for the repository), segments of the protein sequence are tested for structural tendencies.  chaining these predictions together, initial protein folds are put together.  Once put together long term interactions can assemble a protein structure.<\/p>\n\n<p>BTW that is not to say that Protein folding is solved - the solutions that come out often produce a structure that is really similar to the final structure, but often there are substantial differences.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just looking at the individual sequence there are no simple rules to decide how the protein fold - ultimately molecular physics of the individual sequence determines where the fold will go.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is incredibly terse, but it could get you started.  Study of protein without any helices or beta strands is a topic in itself - they can be treated the same way as above.  Then there are also proteins who do not have a single fold, but are dynamic and flop around all the time, or only have a shape when in contact with a surface of some kind.

[Templeton, 1998], cited in [Long &amp; Kittles, 2003]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Which speaks <strong>against<\/strong> the existence of races as a meaningful biological concept.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jorde &amp; Wooding (2004) contend that,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genetic variation is geographically structured, as expected from the partial isolation of human populations during much of their history. Because traditional concepts of race are in turn correlated with geography, <strong>it is inaccurate to state that race is \"biologically meaningless\"<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But they concede that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>there is no scientific support for the concept that human populations are discrete, nonoverlapping entities.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that <strong>in the universally agreed-on taxonomy<\/strong>, formalised in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature<\/a> <strong>there simply is no category for races<\/strong>, whether they would make sense or not.

So you would not expect to have clear divisions into subspecies.  And indeed a quick search of google scholar pulls up no claims in the literature for human subspecies of anatomically modern humans (i.e. no subspecies of homo sapiens since Neanderthals and Denisovans).<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it's certainly the case that you can work out a rough phylogenetic tree of humans.  Native americans are descended from certain northern and eastern asians, and so in the 1400s were more closely related to them then they were to other humans.  Similarly, Austronesians (of Indonesia and Polynesia, e.g.) are more closely related to Taiwanese aborigines than they are to Australian aborigines.  This tree is complicated by how much more migration there has been in the last 1000 years than there was previous to that, but it's still biologically meaningful.<\/p>\n\n<p>But here's the striking thing: traditional notions of \"race\" do not match up well with this tree.  The deepest and most fundamental phylogenetic splits in the human tree are <em>within Africans<\/em>.  If you were going to try to \"scientifically\" come up with races, you'd end up with something vaguely like one for Khoisan, one for other Africans, and one for all non-Africans.  Even ignoring modern admixture, traditional races are not monophyletic.  Any clade including all \"black\" people includes all people, any clade including all \"east asians\" includes all native americans.  (Also note that traditional notions of \"race\" are not stable over time, remember that \"Irish\" used to be a \"race\" on the US census.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Modern admixture even more clearly shows the non-genetic nature of traditional \"races.\"  One genetic <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-12/uop-gsc121809.php\">study<\/a> of people who identify as African-American, found that African ancestry can be as low as 1% and as high as 99%, with the median African-American having 18.5% European ancestry (with 30% having European y-dna).  Furthermore, relatively ancient admixture (for example, in the Northern Africa, Northeastern Africa, Middle East region or in Madagascar) also complicates the situation significantly.<\/p>\n\n<p>To summarize, although human genetic diversity is a real biological phenomenon which can be used to figure out the geographical history of people's ancestors, traditional notions of race do not match up well with the biologically meaningful concepts.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2655,"question_id":2650,"up_vote_count":10},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100006519187707/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":11679,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11679/deondre-patrick","reputation":67,"display_name":"Deondre Patrick"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1420447970,"creation_date":1420447970,"body":"<p>Its not known what the consensus is but there is definitely a decline in the race concept. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"The concept of biological race has declined significantly in frequency of use in physical anthropology in the United States during the 20th century.

In laymans terms, your body senses the increase of testosterone and tells your Leydig Cells in the testes to stop signaling LH (responsible for testosterone production).

This process is summarized in this image:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H1cyb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This only works because the peptide is packaged in a secretory vesicle during synthesis. This protects the peptide against the reductive environment of the cytoplasm, where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione\" rel=\"nofollow\">glutathione<\/a> is likely to reduce the disulfide bonds that hold insulin together.<\/p>\n\n<p>When industrial insulin production moved from extracting the hormone from animal pancreases (pancreai?) to bacterial production of human recombinant insulin, glutathione was likely to cause a problem because simple protein production in bacteria just builds the protein in the cytoplasm, where glutathione is present. It is possible to export the protein into the periplasm during synthesis, similar to how proinsulin is moved into the endoplasmic reticulum during synthesis in human cells, but this can complicate protein purification (larger volumes of media, if protein is inside cells you can spin the cells down and work with a smaller volume). <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_%28medication%29#Principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">more recent methods<\/a> use yeast to make insulin, potentially allowing production of actual insulin instead of proinsulin. And modern purification methods can extract insulin from animal sources that is just as good as recombinant sources.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know from personal experience that it can be very hard to produce proteins with multiple disulfide bonds in bacteria. We attempted to produce mutants of bee venom PLA2 in E. coli, but the protein was misfolded and wound up in inclusion bodies. We purified the inclusion bodies, unfolded the proteins, then slowly refolded them by dialysing the protein in a glutathione solution. We aimed at making a protein with a free thiol for later chemical modification, but that free thiol just picked up a glutathione we couldn't remove without ruining enzyme activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also please note that I am not fully aware of how insulin is made on the industrial scale and I could be wrong.

The written record includes medicinal recipes to prevent miscarriages. The problem then, as now, is that it just can't be done very well.<\/p>\n\n<p>From a 2000 Obstetrics journal article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Human reproduction is extraordinarily wasteful. The reasons for this have taxed all of the contributors to this book. As we move into the 21st century <em>it is sobering to reflect on the fact that we have failed to harness the power of the evolving revolution in molecular medical biology to answer the fundamental question: why is the fate of a fertilized egg so hazardous and so unsuccessful?<\/em> The following account summarizes our limited knowledge of the epidemiology of miscarriage and then moves on to consider some of the medical causes of miscarriage...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Miscarriage is difficult to study, and the causes difficult to establish, so the literature showing that any interventions help (antibiotics, bed rest, supplements, etc.) is not plentiful. Smoking seems to have a deleterious effect on pregnancy. How this relates to early populations is a matter of conjecture.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some good studies do exist, however. <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199906103402304#t=articleResults\" rel=\"nofollow\">One good study<\/a> in the New England Journal of Medicine followed an ideal group: women who had no history of infertility, who were trying to become pregnant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of 221 couples followed for 6 months, a total of 199 pregnancies were detected, of which 126 ended in live birth (therefore a 37% miscarriage rate). Because of the methodology, failure of blastocysts to implant could not be measured. The findings of this study were supported by others (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM198807283190401\" rel=\"nofollow\">31%<\/a>), etc.: early loss increased when implantation occurred later than 10 days after ovulation. While the authors were hopeful (\"There may be opportunities to increase fertility by extending the time during which implantation can occur.\"), they were also realistic (\"Such interventions should be approached cautiously, however, because they may have unintended consequences with respect to the quality of surviving embryos.\") Basically, you can't fool around too much with Mother Nature in this realm.<\/p>\n\n<p>Has modern medicine been able to change this rate? Not really. Even with IVF, where thousands of dollars are spent trying to preserve a single pregnancy (certainly not the norm), miscarriage is common. The best way to increase the viability of IVF pregnancy is to select better oocytes, embryos, etc. In other words, maternal factors remain refractory to manipulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even things obstetricians long took for gospel (for example, bedrest with pre-eclampsia) have <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1998/02000/Treatment_of_Miscarriage__Current_Practice_and.17.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">little evidence of benefit to the fetus<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The literature is vast in this area (reproduction is an important field to study).

So one organism, like a human, has a unique combination of which two alleles out of thousands possible represent each gene in its body. Besides this, major changes are often made not so much by mutations as by changes in the level of gene expression. For example, a mutation in one gene that produces a protein important for regulation of the expression of 50 other genes can cause a lot of change in body development (morphology) and physiology by simply affecting the expression level (amount of protein produced) by these 50 genes. In turn, changed levels of these 50 proteins can make substantial changes in the whole protein interaction network in cells. If you think why sharks look different than elephants, for instance, it's much more because of differential gene expression (including the timing of the expression during body development) than differences brought about by mutations causing functional changes in the coding regions of multiple genes.\nAnd yes, mutations only provide raw material for evolution - diversity to select from. Mutations are a supermarket for evolution, selection is what evolution tends to buy more frequently in this supermarket or what's in demand currently. It is thus selection and drift that work to increase the frequency of certain mutant alleles that actually result in evolution.\nThe mechanism of selection is simple. The functional diversity in populations created by mutations in particular creates different survival rates for particular phenotypes/genotypes based on how well the combination of the alleles representing its genome can create a phenotype that matches environment. For example, in a bacterial population adapted to neutral media there's still a random diversity in the range of pH tolerance. If the medium becomes more acidic, cells that happen to have better tolerance to low pH gradually increase in frequency over time.\nThe difference between prokaryotes, like bacteria, and eukaryotes (like humans) mostly lies in that due to meiosis eukaryotes randomly shuffle alleles, so that they \"intermix\" in a population creating more possible phenotypes to select from. Bacteria do not have this mechanism and can only diverge by cell division, creating diversity only by mutations. However, it is not completely true, as now it is well known that bacteria share a lot of genes via horizontal gene transfer - direct exchange of genes between bacterial cells. This process is often aided by viruses. Horizontal gene transfer, just like meiosis, works to shuffle genes in the population, creating more diversity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26378,"question_id":16287,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1420328380}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16287/how-does-mutation-cause-natural-selection-and-is-it-common-in-protists-or-proka","last_activity_date":1420328380,"creation_date":1396386761,"answer_count":4,"title":"How does mutation cause natural selection? and is it common in protists or prokaryotes?","body":"<p>Why is it inevitable that evolution by mutations alone should be a common cause of evolutionary change in most natural populations?

So for most evolutionary processes we are not long enough present to see them either happening or see the outcome. Therefore its also hard to say that no evolution is happening - see your cockroach example. How do you know that these animals are the same like 10 Mio years ago? And even if it is like this, it can also mean that these animals fit their niche so good, that there is not much pressure for further adaption. \nThis can change pretty fast as examples from mites (here a report in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22039872\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC<\/a>, this is the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12107/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">original publication<\/a>). Another example of fast evolution (of bigger animals) are the Cichlids in the Lake Victoria, which developed new after the last time the lake dried up completely something like 12.000 years ago. After that an estimated 300 endimic species developed (see <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/273/5278/1091.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>) which was then reduced by polution and other environmental problem.

They would have fought for the same biological niche and living space with one species eventually dying out. This has for example happened to all the other homo spcies (habilis, erectus, neanderthalensis). As a species we are quite young (around 200.000 years), so there is something going on. And there is genetic diversion between humans, but still not as much, that we cannot cross each other any more.

You seem to assume that cockroaches (or most animals as you say) did not change much the last tens or hundreds thousands of years. But what do you know about that? Have you actually reviewed many research that estimate the rate of evolution of different randomly chosen lineages in the past 500,000 years? I think you assume that other species evolved slower than humans rather than know it. And you will certainly put much more importance to the evolution of the gene FoxP2 (involved in language) than to a gene allowing cockroaches to have better sense of smell. This is a bias view of what is a rate of evolution. It would be much wiser to consider a rate of evolution as something like the number of newly arising mutations that succeeded to get fixed in the population. See Haldane's rate of evolution and the Darwin unit. Please don't make the mistake to think that being smart (or complex) is some kind of goal of evolution and those that are not smart (or complex) are \"less evolved\" or that they evolved more slowly.<\/p>\n\n<p>You also seem to want to point on evolution of DNA and evolution of habits. I guess you might be appreciative of the evolution of human knowledge and culture. But this is obviously something that does not have to do with genetic evolution but is rather a matter of cognitive capacity. You cannot compare change of culture and traditions of insects and humans as insects have mostly no traditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, this is obviously true that different lineages evolve at different rates. Many things influence this rates such as the population size, the mutation rate, the generation time, the selection pressure (which itself might depends on social structure or the rate of environmental change for example). In these terms I would rather believe of Homo sapiens as a lineage that should have a rather slow evolutionary rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Homo sapiens is quite a recent species. And speciation is often linked with phenotypic divergence, with niche competition and niche complementarity and therefore with a high rate of evolution. In these terms I would believe that humans is a lineage with high evolutionary rate.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13981,"question_id":13976,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1420206199},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2442ea911c89187262d6575d739a1ca7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5148,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5148/swbarnes2","reputation":1824,"display_name":"swbarnes2"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1387165371,"creation_date":1387165371,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>aside from the latter option, why haven't any differences in\n  animals'(except humans) markup, morphology, intelligence, DNA,\n  behavior, or any habits changed over thousands or (possibly millions)\n  of years?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What evidence is leading you to that conclusion?

This famous little equid was once known by the lovely name \"Eohippus\", meaning \"dawn horse\". Some Hyracotherium traits to notice:Legs were flexible and rotatable with all major bones present and\n  unfused. 4 toes on each front foot, 3 on hind feet. Vestiges of 1st (&amp;\n  2nd, behind) toes still present. Hyracotherium walked on pads; its\n  feet were like a dog's padded feet, except with small \"hoofies\" on\n  each toe instead of claws. Small brain with especially small frontal\n  lobes.
