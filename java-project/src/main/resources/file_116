From the Wikipedia article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A decrease in synapses is seen after adolescence reflecting synaptic pruning, and approximately 50% of neurons during development do not survive until adulthood. Pruning is influenced by environmental factors and is widely thought to represent learning.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Synaptic pruning is most significant during development due to \"excessive\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis\">Neurogenesis<\/a> that creates a large number of neurons, many of which will later be pruned. It's not excessive in a bad way, it's simply the case that more neurons are generated than necessary and thus pruning is needed to keep the connections efficient. There's no \"measure twice, cut once\", instead pruning is used to refine connections.<\/p>\n\n<p>Synaptic Pruning really doesn't have anything to do with forgetting; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting\">Forgetting<\/a> is natural and simply happens because connections (via Recall/Rehersal) are not made strongly enough to fully encode memories into Long Term Memory.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that Synaptic Pruning is not the cause for Alzheimer's or other age related degenerative disorders. From Wikipedia again:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Synaptic pruning is classified separately from the regressive events seen during older ages. While developmental pruning is experience dependent, the deteriorating connections that are synonymous with old age are not. The stereotyped pruning can be related to the chiseling and molding of stone into a statue. Once the statue is complete, the weather will begin to erode the statue and this represents the experience independent deletion of connections.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Synaptic Pruning is a normal process of development and occurs in all individuals. Alzheimer's is a very visible disorder due to media focus, but not part of normal developmental/aging effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead I suggest you read more specifically about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease\">Alzheimer's disease<\/a>, there's quite a bit of information on it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2812,"question_id":2811,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1341324358}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2811/is-it-possible-to-lose-synapses-over-time","last_activity_date":1341324358,"creation_date":1341313243,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is it possible to lose synapses over time?","body":"<p>I mean, what if a person is for a long time submitted to conditions in which his mental capacities are not explored, are the synapses undone?

Then it claims most of the volume is water. This is of course true. But while a substance solved in water barely increases its volume, it can still make a difference - soda and water are completely different things and the important statistic to look at here is not the amount of water drunk, but rather the fact that it is <em>soda<\/em>. Where I live, soda usually contains around 27g of sugar per 240ml (8oz) which is 9% of the GDA. So according to this data, people consume half their energy needs of that day with the drink they get in their restaurant meal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other statistic is about calories per ounce of the food. What sense does a statistic about that make? The only relevance of the calorie density of food would be the effect on how well it is digested, and for that only a calorie number isn't really helpful. The relative ratios of fibre, carbohydrates and fats would be much more useful in that case. The only interesting statistic here is that meals have almost doubled in size. The fact that the volume of meals has increased much more hints that there is a higher portion of less calorific foods, such as salads.<\/p>\n\n<p>Impact on metabolism? Hard to say, this is a statistic about what people eat at restaurants, which is not really something that you expect to reflect their refular diet. It doesn't tell you anything about their general lifestyle, which would be the relevant statistic for effects on metabolism. If you only look at restaurant meals, those could look really unhealthy but on the larger scale, people balance it out in their every day diet and general lifestyle. If you had an additional statistic that shows that people actually eat a significiant amount of meals at restaurants, and they're the kind of meals described by the infographic you gave, that would have some implications.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2453,"question_id":2449,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2449/what-impacts-on-metabolism-are-likely-from-the-6x-increase-in-water-consumption","last_activity_date":1341132157,"creation_date":1338476693,"answer_count":1,"title":"What impacts on metabolism are likely from the 6x increase in water consumption by Americans at restaurants since the 1950s?","body":"<p>CDC data show that American water consumption in restaurant meals is 600% of what it was in the 1950s while meal calorie density has decreased (kcal/oz).

Insects which have adopted this method are far more diverse than their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemimetabolism\">hemimetabolous<\/a> counterparts. A conservative estimate by Hammond (1992) is that holometabolous insects comprise more than 60% of all living organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>The subclass <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygota\">Pterygota<\/a> (winged insects) is divided into (super orders) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endopterygota\">endopterygota<\/a> (wings develop interiorly) which are holometabolous, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exopterygota\">exopterygota<\/a> (external wing development) which are hemimetabolous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hemimetabolous insects (usually) develop from an egg to an adult through a series of immature forms (known as nymphs or instars) which are slightly modified (and usually slightly larger) forms of the preceding form. There are exceptions to this mode within the exopterygota including asexual parthenogenesis which is common in aphids. The general life cycle is well illustrated in the Dermaptera (earwigs). All stages inhabit the same ecological niche and so maintain the same general body plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/K8LHR.png\" alt=\"Dermaptera lifecycle, from Wikimedia commons\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Image file from Wikimedia Commons <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3aEarwig_life_cycle_2.svg\">here<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Although hemimetaboly is a more gradual process than holometaboly, it happens in a small number (often four or five nymphal instars) of discrete steps rather than the more continuous development of other animals such as mammals. Although all insects fall into either the exopterygote or endopterygote categories (i.e. wings either develop externally or internally), there are examples of intermediate processes which lie somewhere between hemi- and holometaboly. A notable example are the Cicadas. Cicadas are Hemiperans (true bugs) which lie in the exopterygota and so are, by default hemimetabolous. However there is a considerable difference between their immature and mature stages:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HK9tn.jpg\" alt=\"Cicada (Auchenorrhyncha: Hemiptera) development\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Illustration by Debbie Hadley, using drawings from Insects - Their Ways and Means of Living by Robert Evans Snodgrass, U.S. Bureau of Entomology. These drawings are in the public domain. From <a href=\"http://insects.about.com/od/growthmetamorphosi1/ss/typesmetamorph_3.htm\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the immature stages, the larva (or nymph) will burrow underground, sometimes for many years. This requires strong front appendages, which they also use when they surface to grip onto a surface whilst they shed their final skin to become an adult. This differential niche exploitation is likely to have given rise to the morphological differences between immature and mature life stages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exploiting different niches during different developmental stages not only reduces intra-specific competition between young and adult, it also enables the insect to be more specialised to fulfill their specific role, which changes as they develop. The role of the immature is to grow, they do not yet need to be able to reproduce or disperse; whereas the role of the adult is to find a mate and reproduce. Young often develop below ground where there are fewer predators, adults often fly to enhance dispersal (further reducing competition and also decreasing inbreeding). These two activities call for vastly different body designs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some other common holometabolous insect orders are Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), and Diptera (true flies), whereas hemimetabolous groups include Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets etc.), Mantodea (praying mantids), and Blattaria (cockroaches).<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the chrysalis which Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) have evolved to surround their pupal stage, the main role is likely to be protection. Larvae (caterpillars) are a highly nutritious and energetic food source and thus have adapted defensive mechanisms such as mimicry, warning colours, and dropping to the ground when disturbed. This drop would damage the metamorphosing pupa (the most vulnerable stage as it is usually relatively immobile), as the cuticle softens to allow for cell-rearrangement.<\/p>\n\n<p>The process of insect development is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH), see <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0028728#pone.0028728-Kristensen1\">Konopova<\/a> <em>et al<\/em>, (2011) for more on this.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hammond, P.

The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">photosynthetic efficiency<\/a> WP page gives ranges of between 0.1 and 8% of total solar radiation converted to \"biomass\", but these values are not cited. In their review, <a href=\"http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/36097/PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Zhu et al, 2008)<\/a> state that the maximum maximum efﬁciency with which photosynthesis can convert solar energy into biomass is 3.5% and 4.3% for C3 and C4 plants (both observed for crops), respectively. Biomass is not a measure of energy, but perhaps they mean potential chemical energy in that biomass.<\/p>\n\n<p>Its a pretty complicated question though. Photosynthesis is a complex process involving many interdependent chemical reactions and physical processes. All species (or even individuals) of plants have different morphology, physiology, and biochemistry that influences overall photosynthetic efficiency. In addition, they each inhabit different ecological niches and climate space. Therefore, all species or individuals would have a slightly unique maximum potential efficiency. Here are a couple other efficiency related concepts to consider:<\/p>\n\n<p>There are 2 systems in photosynthesis that work in tandem, the light reaction and the dark reaction.  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#Light_reactions\" rel=\"nofollow\">light reaction<\/a> uses light energy, pigments like chlorophyll, and a bunch of electron transport chain proteins to generate ATP and NADPH. These 2 molecules then provide the reducing power for use in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#Light-independent_reactions\" rel=\"nofollow\">dark reaction<\/a> (the Calvin Cycle). In the dark reaction, the enzyme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO\" rel=\"nofollow\">RuBisCO<\/a> joins CO<sub>2<\/sub> and RuBP, creating simple reduced carbon chains which are then used to assemble sugars. This is an over-simplification, as both reactions are very complex systems with lots of biochemical machinery, but this is the basic process used to convert light energy to chemical energy. To operate at peak efficiency, the entire process must not be limited by incoming energy (light), substrate supply (CO<sub>2<\/sub>, RuBP), or nutrients used to construct all the needed cellular and molecular machinery (N, P, K, and many others). In reality, there are limits that vary from plant to plant, species to species. For example, a species or individual with a very reflective leaf surface converts less of the light reaching the leaf surface to chemical energy, thus lowering the output of ATP and NADPH. This reduces the chemical energy supplied to the dark reaction and limits the amount of carbon fixed by RuBisCO. So the reflective surface of the leaf, which might be advantageous to the plant in other ways, has a large impact on overall photosynthetic efficiency (compared to a less reflective leaf or leaves).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to search for more information, there are a number of terms that plant physiologists and ecologists use when describing a plant's (or communities of plants) photosynthetic efficiency.

They do not have free will or any more complex decision-making process like common sense. This is evident is lots of insect behaviour: flying repeatedly at a closed window; landing on brightly coloured clothes instead of flowers; and returning to a food source when they are in real danger of being swatted!<\/p>\n\n<p>When a fly senses the food (often by olfactory receptors), they are 'programmed' to fly towards it in response to some chemical they sense depending on the species and food. They may not have adapted a response to swatting, or perhaps the food cue overrides others. In nature swatting is not so much of a threat to a fly. Some animals may brush them away, but since they are not really doing any harm in feeding from another animal's food, they are mostly ignored.<\/p>\n\n<p>CO2 traps are used to entice and kill mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are attracted to CO2 (as it is dispelled from the animals from which they blood feed), they will only evolve to avoid the traps if there is another cue which they could eventually associate with a negative effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to remember when thinking about insect behaviour is that their life strategy is very different to ours. Insects are more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\">r-selected<\/a> than humans, meaning that each individual life has not had so much energy put into it as a more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\">K-selected<\/a> animal (such as humans), and to compensate for this, many more young are produced.

Kakapo were (and still are) very close to extinction, so in the 1980s the <a href=\"http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/\">Kakapo Recovery Programme<\/a> was launched. As part of this programme, rangers monitor all known kakapo in the wild, visiting their nests and generally ensuring they are in good health. When Sirocco was a young chick, a ranger discovered him in his mothers nest with severe breathing problems. He was brought back to the Kakapo care hut and raised by humans. As a result of this, he imprinted on his carers (<a href=\"http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=191\">see his website!<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Imprinting is common in birds, and takes several different forms. The most well-known form is filial imprinting, where young birds (and some other animals) develop a strong fixated image of who their mother is. They then learn their behaviour almost exclusively from the animal they fixated on. This is well studied in geese, for example by Konrad Lorenz.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, Sirocco was demonstrating sexual imprinting. This is where young animals (including humans, see e.g. Bereczkei et al., 2004) learn which characteristics are sexually desirable by fixing an image of their parent(s). In Sirocco's case, he imprinted on a human and subsequently saw humans as his species, and therefore potential mates.<\/p>\n\n<p>The exact purpose of sexual imprinting has been widely discussed (e.g. see Immelmann, 1972). Lorenz suggested that it allowed animals to recognise their own species. However, some imprintable birds will show a preference toward individuals resembling the one they imprinted on, but when introduced to their own species will still recognise them as potential sexual partners. It may therefore be the case that imprinting allows a juvenile firstly to supplement a genetic predisposition toward its own species, but secondly to recognise closely related and less related individuals. Bateson (1978) suggested that this would enable a sexual strategy of choosing mates which are sufficiently unrelated so as not to cause inbreeding depression, but sufficiently related so as not to cause outbreeding depression, and he found an example which bore out the predicted behaviour in Japanese quails.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sirocco seems not to have the genetic ability to recognise his own species, and according to his website does not associate with other birds.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/273659a0\"> <strong>Bateson P<\/strong>. 1978.

In comparison, rat cerebellum contains more than twice as many cells (∼170 million), >80% of which are neurons (Table 1, top). Therefore, the adult rat brain contains almost five times as many neurons in the cerebellum (∼140 million) than in the cerebral cortex. When all of the brain regions are taken into consideration, the cerebellum thus accounts for more than one-half of the cells and ∼70% of all of the neurons of the entire rat brain (Table 1, bottom). Overall, we estimate that of all of the cells in the adult rat brain, 60%, or 200.13 ± 21.17 million, are neurons. Glial cells, therefore, contrary to common belief, are not the most numerous cell type in the rat brain. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/10/2518.full\">Isotropic Fractionator: A Simple, Rapid Method for the Quantification of Total Cell and Neuron Numbers in the Brain<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/103/32/12138.full#sec-1\">Cellular scaling rules for rodent brains<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/\">The Human Brain in Numbers: A Linearly Scaled-up Primate Brain<\/a> <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":1187,"question_id":1171,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff3e84bcedd40163c74d33b827ac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/307/lancelafontaine","reputation":3814,"display_name":"LanceLafontaine","accept_rate":47},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff3e84bcedd40163c74d33b827ac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/307/lancelafontaine","reputation":3814,"display_name":"LanceLafontaine","accept_rate":47},"score":0,"post_id":2773,"edited":false,"creation_date":1340816658,"comment_id":3954,"body":"If someone can manage to obtain the information, can you report it?

The reasoning behind these observations may again be due to varying degrees of cell turnover between the species. Large dogs consist of more cells than small dogs and as a result more cell turnover was initially required in their development compared to small dogs.

This is an intriguing idea when looking at embryos - early stage embryos of flies, birds, fish and primates really do resemble each other.  So the idea was that our lower brain, near the spinal chord was the brain of a lizard, whereas the prefrontal cortex, which is highly developed in humans compared to lizards, birds etc was 'added later' and represents a 'human brain'.  This idea is flawed because it basically assumed that the lizard part of us never evolved and was based on a linear idea of phylogeny, as opposed to Darwin's idea of evolutionary trees where lizards and insect continue to evolve.  In evolution there are no 'lower animals'.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In practice, the parts of the brain we have in common with lizards do handle more physiologically autonomous functions (heart rate, etc).  While cortex and prefrontal cortex do show greater activity in emotional and rational decision making.  <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC6aOntogeny.shtml\">This is now more of a rule of thumb<\/a>, not a rigorous statement or a theory of development, merely the result that structures that were developed later tend to have newer functions.  A good discussion of this can be found in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny_and_Phylogeny_%28book%29\">Gould's \"Ontogeny and Philogeny\"<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your question also asks why we can't rationally understand our lower brain functions...<\/p>\n\n<p>Awareness itself is not an intrinsic property of the brain.  Some aspects of the rational mind and articulate self consciousness are so far fairly unique amongst brains.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I should mention at this point that I do not mean that conscious thought is unique to humans - its clear that <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=monkey-in-the-mirror\">primates<\/a> are aware that they exist and have empathy for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_%28gorilla%29#Koko.27s_pets\">feelings of others<\/a>. Its likely that other animals have similar amazing <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/new-crow-tools/\">abilities we think of as human<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just the same, the level of development in humans is distinctly unique.  Insofar as it is a unique development, not a typical brain function, we should understand that it is far from all encompassing.  Given all this, its not surprising that the physiological functions of the brain such as regulation of breathing, many hormonal levels, stress are not conscious.  I usually only know I've run too far and too hard because I can feel my chest heave - its actually only something I'm aware of because my brain is receiving signals from my chest that its heaving and my heart is beating rapidly.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The limits of our consciousness are the subject of much study now.  From cognitive psychology and behavioral economics we've been surprised over and over in the past 20 years how there are limits to the amount of information we can process at a time and, how limited we are in being rational to the point that we can make foolish decisions, and lastly how much of those decisions are made subconciously, only to be rationalized later by our thoughts.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I will give three examples.<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Experiments in cognitive psych show that as subjects turn over cards in a deck, our pulse and respiration indicate they know that the deck is stacked before they consciously know.  <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Psychologist/Philosopher Joshua Greene is famous for observing that moral decisions are made in parallel in more than one region of the brain before the decision is rationally made.  This is a <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/2007/aug/13/\">great radiolab podcast<\/a> on this story. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) Behavioral economists have shown that we don't even know a good deal when we see it.  We are often convinced by cues in the environment about the profitability of our decisions which comes from pre-set processes embodied in our minds.  Studies showing what happens when we <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_15272782\">pay CEOs too much money<\/a>, manipulate decision making <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/17723028\">by offering too many choices<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hidden-motives/201008/why-are-the-poor-more-generous\">how poor people are more generous than wealthy ones<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This discussion goes back to Descartes, who felt we could be fooling ourselves to the point that we might even be deluding ourselves to believe in mathematics.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If there are ever times when people do things that don't make sense, we have often found that the faults go back to the limitations of our brains.   If you have never had that experience ... \"Ill have what @Sylvain's having\"!<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking at references for cognitive dissonance, optical illusions will tell you a dozen more fascinating stories.

The classic example of this sort of trait is senescence.  Why do we grow old and die?  Clearly it doesn't stop us from having offspring.  I generally don't find this sort of answer informative. Its not a bad argument for the traits of bipolar and schitzophrenic tendencies which can manifest as a chronic mental condition, often in the 30s after many people have children.<br>\nThese traits are fairly common (1 in 6) in the population.<br>\nIt is usually arguable that these traits are of some sort of advantage from some perspective (including my examples).  In this case @Andrew argues this.  I'm not sure I agree, but you can read his post for the argument. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/pleiotropy-one-gene-can-affect-multiple-traits-569\">Pleiotropy<\/a>. The idea that the negative trait evidences more than one trait.  In this case one might say that baldness is tied with another trait that is beneficial.  Some say that the cause of male pattern baldness, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldness#Evolutionary_hypotheses\">which is an excess of testosterone<\/a>, would be tied in with other masculine signals, which can often outweigh disadvantages of being bald and trying to find a mate.  A trait like baldness could also for instance be tied to a desirable trait in women, causing it to persist in men as a result of the advantage of say, less hairy women.  I probably wouldn't take this stand either, though its conceivable. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) \"Neutral variant\" The third explanation that I will put out is that baldness simply isn't a trait with enough disadvantage (if any) that it should be removed from the gene pool.  While there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/fashion/weddings/23FIELD.html\">evidence that baldness<\/a> is a <a href=\"http://blog.timesunion.com/kristi/women-5-times-more-likely-to-go-for-men-with-hair/9687/\">disadvantage come friday night<\/a>, to say that a trait is disadvantageous we have to see, <em>in the long run<\/em> - over the lifetime - really is a disadvantage.  I think I would agree with those who say that while some women do not find bald men attractive, <a href=\"http://www.helium.com/items/1530613-women-dating-bald-men\">its not enough to stop them from having kids<\/a>, which is all evolution cares about. <\/p>\n\n<p>And if you happen to be balding probably what you should care about, guys!<\/p>\n\n<p>If evolution should eliminate male baldness, then why not eliminate sterility, homeliness, impotence, poverty, obesity, being dull, living with your parents and adolescent awkwardness?  These are probably even more important obstacles to finding a mate? All of these traits are beneficial traits that are maladapted to modern life or genetic accidents.  Evolution can't get rid of them at all I think.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For an even more complete discussion of the general subject, see Dawkin's \"The Extended Phenotype\".

Notably, for the latter case, mice are the species which has been used the most for transgenesis, as they are cheap (compared to, say, using pigs), do not take lots of space, have big litters and a quick reproductive cycle (~20 days). Aside from mice we've seen GFP rats, pigs, dogs, cats, sheep and probably there is more, but I will mostly restrict my answers to mice (as far as I know there are big technical difficulties in applying transgenics procedures to something bigger than a mouse, but to be honest I could not explain you the details on this as I have never done it).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What features can be easily inserted into almost any organism easily?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, essentially, it is easy to give rise to monogenic traits (i.e. traits that depend on a single gene). Generally speaking, when you want to have more traits, or need more than 1 gene to have the trait you create single transgenics and then breed them together.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, if your phenotype depends on the presence of gene A and B you will generate a (mouse) line expressing A, one expressing B, you breed them together and, if you are lucky, a part of the pups will be expressing both.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Next, I imagine that to design and create an artificial life-form will consist of three steps: 1. Figure out which proteins will give rise to those feaures, 2. Design a genome that will express those proteins in the right quantities and 3.

Doing this for a multicellular being is, presently, science-fiction.<\/p>\n\n<p>What normally you would do is to insert or remove just the piece of DNA you need in the genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are different approaches to do that: for instance, you can start from embryonic stem cells, from fertilized oocytes or from spermatozoa.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the general process for making a transgenic mouse:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/Transgenics.gif?dur=233\" alt=\"Making a transgenic mouse\"><br>\nSource: <a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/TransgenicAnimals.html\">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/TransgenicAnimals.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, depending on how you inject your gene you can distinguish between transgenics and knock-in mice. In a transgenic mouse you insert the gene somewhere in the genome and, although there are method to understand where it ended up you generally do not know.\nKnock-in animals, instead, target a specific region of the genome. This is usually used in order to change an existing gene, to improve its function or to remove its function (knock-out animals). This process, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_targeting\">gene targeting<\/a> relies on the biological process called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination\">homologous recombination<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, why don't we just synthesize a new genome each time?\nAside from Venter's dream, the process would:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>have incredibly high cost<\/li>\n<li>be extremely complicated technically<\/li>\n<li>be extremely long (mostly for reason 2)<\/li>\n<li>suffer from the problem that there is so much we do not know about genome regulation in a bacteria, let alone in a mouse! You have to think that the genome is not just a series of genes one after another: there is a big part of regulatory regions that define things like the 3D form of the genome, which determines when and how much genes are accessible for transcription, when and where they are activated and so on. Also, more and more attention is now drawn to something called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\">epigenetics<\/a> marks, modifications of the DNA, or its associated proteins that can also modulate its transcription.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the cheapest experiment you can perform at your own home without access to a biology lab which involves changing the genome of a living organism in a way that's functionally visible?

You imagine a set of features that you want a life-form to have. Just to take an arbitrary example, say you want your life-form to have a) a strong sense of smell, b) the ability to fly and c) a comfortable couch shaped saddle on its back. What's the sequence of steps you need to take so that you can create this life-form in the lab?<\/p>\n\n<p>I realize that we are probably far away from solving this very general problem. But perhaps there are some smaller subproblems that we do know how to solve.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, as far as I gather, you can probably make any living being fluorescent green in color by inserting into its genome the gene responsible for expressing the Green Fluorescent Protein. So may be if we limit the set of features one is allowed to choose from, the above problem can be solved. So my first question of the set of questions is:<\/p>\n\n<p>1)  What features can be easily inserted into almost any organism easily?<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, I imagine that to design and create an artificial life-form will consist of three steps: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Figure out which proteins will give rise to those feaures, <\/li>\n<li>Design a genome that will express those proteins in the right quantities and <\/li>\n<li>Implant that genome into a cell and actually let the being grow.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>2)  Is the above sequence of steps correct, or am I missing something?<\/p>\n\n<p>3)  What is the state of the art for each of these steps?<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, in light of the recent spur in the open source biology groups and DIYbio enthusiasts, I feel that there might be some very simple but really cool things related to my question that you can already do in your garage.

Essentially the answer is that it varies a lot between organisms and environmental conditions, but for any given gene a mutation occurs once in about 50,000 sexual replications. That is equivalent to, in a human, several hundred new mutations in each person born. Impressively, Haldane's calculations have since been confirmed by a variety of other methods (e.g. Nachman &amp; Crowell, 2000; Xue et al., 2009).<\/p>\n\n<p>Faster rates of evolution have been recorded in other organisms, and there have been many, many studies looking at the rate of increase in sizes of the whole body or of particular organs of a wide variety of animals and plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, Azevedo et al. (2002) look at the rate of mutations affecting size (trying to select for decrease in body size) in C. elegans, and found mutations affecting size occured at a rate of ~0.0025 per haploid genome per generation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In another example, with a result more definite regarding your question, Keightley (1998) investigated the rate of change in average body weight under conditions of selection for increased body size, over 50 generations in mice. They recorded an average increase of 0.23-0.57% body weight per generation from new mutations. That's pretty huge, and demonstrates how rapidly a complex trait can change by mutation under selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wrote a small piece of python code to calculate the increase after x generations at the same rate (the formula is very simple)...<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>initial = 1\nrate = 0.35\ngenerations = 1000\nresult = initial * (1.0 + rate) ** generations\nprint result\n&gt;&gt;&gt;20.10655586861808\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Thus if we assume that approximately the average rate found in the mouse study (0.35%) could be the rate at which giraffes' necks might increase under strong selection, after 1000 generations the mean neck length would be over 20 times the original length. A low estimate for wild giraffe longevity is around 20 years, thus for giraffe necks to increase around 20x might take 20,000 years. Of course this basic estimate is making a whole lot of assumptions, but the point is that rates of mutation are actually very high, easily enough to explain the diversity of traits we see in the world.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/162/2/755\"> <strong>Azevedo RBR, Keightley PD, Laurén-Määttä C, Vassilieva LL, Lynch M, Leroi AM<\/strong>. 2002.

However, there are some very important differences, most notably they have very different cell membranes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The origin of the eukaryotic cell is a very difficult subject, as it evolved over 2 billion years ago in organisms that don't fossilize well and there are no living descendants of intermediate forms.

My understanding is that the leading theory is that the eukaryotic cell was formed by endosymbiosis between an archaeon and two bacteria.  In that model the nucleus is descended from a methanogenic archaeon, the cell membrane is descended from a myxobacteria, and the mitochondria is descended from a proteobacteria.

This works between eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria and causes the mixing of the three.<\/p>\n\n<p>An overview (originally proposed by <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Woese <em>et al<\/em><\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bacteria are simplest considering cellular organisation. They have no nucleus or other internal membranes and no cytoskeleton. Their DNA is generally \"junk-free\"* (i.e. no introns), not bound by histones (\"organising\" proteins) and the organisation of regulatory sequences is relatively straightforward, typically with one 'operator' sequence before a gene.<\/li>\n<li>Eukaryotes are complex cells in comparison. They have a nucleus and are full of internal membranes (ER, golgi, vesicles,...). Their complex cytoskeleton allows them to grow very large in comparison. Their DNA is usually full of more or less \"junk\"*, organised into tight bundles by histones and they tend to have a ridiculous amount of regulatory sequences way before, just at the start and even <em>inside<\/em> genes. Very importantly, they possess endosymbionts as you mentioned - mitochondria or plasmids, derived probably from some protobacterium.<\/li>\n<li>Archaea at first appear to be a mixture between the two. A nice way to sum it up (though not very accurate) is \"eukaryote in a bacterium's clothing\". Their cells look a lot like prokaryotes because they are similar size, have no nucleus, endomembranes or cytoskeleton. However, some archaeas' DNA <em>is<\/em> bound by histones and they use similar machinery as eukaryotes for DNA replication, transcription and translation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>One possible explanation for this (theory by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Kingdoms-Illustrated-Guide-Phyla/dp/0716730278\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margulis &amp; Schwartz<\/a> as explained by my tutor) is: From the last universal common ancestor, first prokaryotes and archaea diverged. After this branching, the differences in genetic machinery evolved. Archaea then branched, producing a protoeukaryote line which went on to endosymbiosis with some protobacteria. That would explain the similarities I outlined above: similar cell structure between archaea and prokaryotes but similar genetic machinery between archaea and eukaryotes.<\/p>\n\n<p>It gets a bit more complicated though, because archaea and bacteria can exchange genetic material, and eukaryotes incorporated a lot of their endosymbionts' DNA in their own genome, so you end up with all of them having a huge mix of genes from the others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: Genetic machinery refers to the enzymes used for DNA replication and transcription (DNA and RNA polymerase and the transcription initiation factors) and translation (ribosomes and several other translation factors involved). For example: Prokaryotes only have one type of RNA polymerase which uses sigma factor to bind the initiaion site. Eukaryotes and archaea both have three types of RNA polymerase which use TATA-binding protein for initiation. Or: In Prokaryotes, the translation start codon codes for formyl-methionine while in eukaryotes and archaea it codes for \"normal\" methionine. (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674%2800%2980284-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>*) Unrelated to your question, but in my own defence: I am aware that the usage of the word \"junk\" is somewhat unaccepted nowadays, because it supposes that there is \"useful\" and \"unuseful\" genetic material. Also, some of what was thought to be junk has been identified to have regulatory function etc. However, it's also a fact that a lot has been identified to have no function to the cell whatsoever, most of it parasitic DNA which is dead or still happily replicating away (LINEs and SINEs).

To avoid dualism in explaining consciousness. However, he has gone so far down the reductionist rabbit-hole that he popped out on the other side. He arrived at the same 'magic' we feared in dualism except now he called it 'quantum mechanics'. <\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest irony of this approach is that Penrose was inspired in many ways by Schrodinger's beautiful take on life. Although Schrödinger does bring in quantum mechanics (both as a useful reduction and as an analogy) he uses completely different parts of it (he uses the discritization of energy levels, and specially avoids issues of the uncertainty principle and superposition of states that made him famous).  Schrödinger would completely disagree with Penrose and Hameroff::<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I]f we were organisms so sensitive that a single atom, or even a few atoms, could make a perceptible impression on our senses -- Heaves, what would life be like!

It is absolutely something you should do before beginning an experiment, and preferably something you should do in collaboration with the person who is going to be helping you analyze your data. To address a couple points:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You'll see all kinds of researchers doing all manner of sloppy things when it comes to statistics and data analysis. Reading some journals makes me groan. You won't necessarily find it a problem for your field, but one should ask oneself if the goal is merely not to get called out by your peers, or to actually run a well designed experiment.<\/li>\n<li>The consequences to the validity of your results lie in an increased risk of Type II error - the incorrect failure to reject the null hypothesis, or in slightly clearer English, finding no effect when an effect exists in reality. Which means, if you run an under powered study, you run the risk of doing the entire experiment, finding nothing, and being <em>wrong<\/em>. The consequences of that are myriad - first, it likely harms your chances to get published, as null results are often quite difficult to get into press. Second, if it <em>does<\/em> get into press, you've managed to get an <em>incorrect finding<\/em> into the literature, which will then be propagated in meta-analysis, reviews, and the minds of impressionable future readers. And then there's the chance you'll abandon a potentially productive line of inquiry because you couldn't be bothered to do power analysis.<\/li>\n<li>One thing to also consider is that not having conducted power analysis somewhat limits your ability to chase after interesting sub-findings. If you've built your experiment on a shaky foundation, and then want to do a second analysis on a sub-set of your results, you almost certainly don't have the power for it.<\/li>\n<li>There are times when you'll be required to do power analysis. If you do research that's clinically relevant, and you ever want it to appear in one of those journals, you may very well be required to show you had a properly powered experiment. And many grant applications require you do so. Even if they don't require it, some people will do a napkin math estimation of your power if they don't see it appearing in your application anywhere.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>sjcockell is partially correct. To do power analysis, you at least need to have some notion of the effect measure you're likely to see. And these are indeed just estimations of what you'll see. But in nearly all circumstances, you'll likely have some ideas already. Are there similar experiments you can draw from? Your own pilot studies? A \"feel\" born of experience in your particular system?<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also trivially easy to calculate power under a number of difference scenarios, to ensure your experiment is sufficiently powered if things go considerably worse than expected. For example, in a study I once did the power calculations for, we weren't sure what the ratio of exposed to unexposed subjects would be. So I ran it over a large range:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aPPPG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Which left me with the confidence that even if I was in my \"worst case\" scenario, I'd have reasonably good power at realistic effect sizes.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's the true strength of power calculations. They'll tell you things about your study. What you need. What doesn't matter. Whether or not before you spend time and money pursuing an idea if you have a reasonable chance at success. Sit down with someone, take an hour or two (at most for a simple experiment) and do it right. Or ask CrossValidated for advice.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1015,"question_id":963,"up_vote_count":17},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1d3326342ee9de40822577d766465e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":72,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/72/yamad","reputation":2340,"display_name":"yamad"},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1339773464,"creation_date":1334261164,"body":"<p>Due to my own woeful ignorance on the subject, I have been reading up on statistical methods recently. From what (little) I understand, the real answer to this question is:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes, but only if you are doing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyman%E2%80%93Pearson_lemma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Absolutely not, if you are using Fisher p-values<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>That is, the question isn't formulated correctly, because power analysis is only valid under one statistical framework (Neyman-Pearson). And you are probably not using that framework.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my experience, most experimental biologists use Fisher's p-value, which gives the probability of the data (or more extreme data) assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Under Fisher's framework, among other drawbacks, there is no quantitative measure of the test's power. However, it has the benefit that it allows scientists to do something close to what we would like to do--that is to draw conclusions from evidence obtained in individual experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Neyman-Pearson framework does included the idea of a test's power, because you must formulate an alternative hypothesis as well as desired alpha and beta error rates before starting your experiment. However, it mostly denies us the ability to make inferences from individual experiments, and for that reason appears less suited to experimental science. To quote from Goodman (see below), under Neyman-Pearson, \"we must abandon our ability to measure evidence, or judge truth, in an individual experiment.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no clear <em>right<\/em> frequentist framework, although what is clear is that you cannot mix Fisher and Neyman-Pearson. Finally, although it doesn't really address your question directly, it seems wrong not to mention Bayesian methods as an alternative to these two frequentist frameworks, which comes with its own baggage.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Further reading from people that understand this much better than me:<\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/16071/10506\">Michael Lew's answer to \"Setting the threshold p-value as part of hypothesis generation\" at Cross Validated<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/4551/10506\">Michael Lew's answer to \"What are common statistical sins\" at Cross Validated<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Hubbard, Raymond, and M.

Cells are usually given a developmental state, but no memory.  A cell may become a liver cell, cancerous, or diabetic, but this is not memory, but a physiological change in the cell which is usually not reversible to a previous state.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For example cancer treatments are entirely focused on identifying the cancerous cells and <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment/types-of-treatment\">killing them<\/a>.   <a href=\"http://publications.icr.ac.uk/9196/\">Internally the genomes of cancer cells often have deletions and duplications.<\/a>  They are cancerous, they have not learned to be cancerous. Though not as dramatic, it is now thought that cellular differentiation which creates different types of cells is heavily influenced by epigenetic modification of the genome; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation#Mechanisms\">the DNA is marked by methyl groups which dictates the state of the cell by modifying the gene<\/a>.  This is mediated by proteins for sure, but is quite complex and not well understood at this time. Epigenetic markers can even change gene behavior between generations of offspring as well, though that is not usually called memory. <\/p>\n\n<p>How is information stored in the brain?  This is thought to be reflected in the organization of the neurons in the brain.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron#Classes\">There are many kinds of neurons.<\/a>  They can be distinguished by the sorts of axons and dendrites that emanate from the cell body.  They can also be distinguished by the chemical variety of neurotransmitter they use (there are a score of different molecules).  So to a great extent the type of cell and the specific proteins it chooses to use to mediate information is very important.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, information is currently thought to highly related to the placement of the axons and dendrites connecting the neuron to sometimes scores of other cells, sometimes touching the cell body, other times other dendrites or neurons.  As neural activity ensues, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity#Neurobiology\">the cells will reconfigure their connections by physically moving them<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>More recently, investigators have tried to understand the genes which internally modulate the neural signals within the cells.  <a href=\"http://mcb.berkeley.edu/courses/mcb160/Fall2006/readings/Kandel%20review%202001.pdf\">This nobel prize lecture discusses how the CREB/MAPK pathway can modulate Long Term Potentiation - the shape of the neuron response to a signal over time (days or hours)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Taken as a whole, you can see that memory is likely to be stored on several levels at once - the kinds of cells (dictated by differentiation) involved, structural arrangement of the neurons (axons and dendrites connecting to various cells and places on cells), as well as internal signaling circuitry that generates and modulate the electrical and chemical activity within the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Marker protein\" only refers to a protein that you can follow to see some sort of activity in the cell. A typical example is Green Fluorescent Protein, which is colored, fused with a protein of interest.  It has no specific meaning regarding learning I think. <\/p>\n","answer_id":2598,"question_id":2595,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/222b478bab6d59dc5de514a87dba88cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":389,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/389/bobthejoe","reputation":4911,"display_name":"bobthejoe","accept_rate":53},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1339527886,"creation_date":1339527886,"body":"<p>If you're interested in understanding the maintenance of state, history, and information, I would look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis\" rel=\"nofollow\">hysteresis<\/a>.

It adds in lyrics, so giving a perspective of which portions of the brain are reacting to which component of the music.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, contrasts between sad music with versus without lyrics recruited the parahippocampal gyrus, the amygdala, the claustrum, the putamen, the precentral gyrus, the medial and inferior frontal gyri (including Broca\u2019s area), and the auditory cortex, while the reverse contrast produced no activations. Happy music without lyrics activated structures of the limbic system and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas auditory regions alone responded to happy music with lyrics.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the limitations of this particular study is that the subjects self-selected their own pieces, which may limit the reliability of the results.  Of course, defining \"happy\" or \"sad\" for every individual is slightly subjective and difficult.  They cited an earlier \"pioneering\" study which standardized the musical selection between subjects.  Without consideration of the lyrics:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first pioneer study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by Khalfa et al. (2005) chose a controlled manipulation of two musical features (tempo and mode) to vary the happy or sad emotional connotations of 34 instrumental pieces of classical music, lasting 10s each. Sad pieces in minor-mode contrasted with happy pieces in major mode produced activations in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 10) and the adjacent superior frontal gyrus (BA 9). These regions have been associated with emotional experiences, introspection, and self-referential evaluation (Jacobsen et al., 2006; Kornysheva et al., 2010).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As an aside to answer your final thought, in cases like this I think trying to jam everything under an umbrella of one \"neurotransmitter system\" or another can make things overly simplistic to the point where you lose focus of the diversity of receptors expressed.

A retrovirus has an RNA genome in the virus particle, and integrates with the host cell's DNA upon infection to hijack the transcription/translation machinery and produce copies of itself. For this reason, it is not possible to \"cure\" a cell of a retroviral infection; instead all of the infected cells must be destroyed or commit suicide through apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death. Common examples of retroviruses include HIV (causative agent of AIDS), HTLV (human T-cell leukemia virus), and the Hepatitis B virus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Viral infections are most common in somatic cells, where any change in the DNA sequence is not passed along to the next generation. However, any retroviral infection in germ cells (eggs, sperm, and the progenitor cells that make them) could be passed on to the next generation, and over time spread throughout a population. Some HERV fragments are apparently completely inactive (at least as far as we are able to tell currently), and are a possible source for some of the so-called \"junk\" or non-coding non-regulatory DNA that makes up a significant part of our genome - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15044706\" rel=\"nofollow\">one estimate<\/a> claims that 8% of our genetic material is of retroviral origin. Other HERVs have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including multiple sclerosis. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure that any human genes have been found that were picked up by a virus, stayed with it for a time (and potentially mutated), then was reinserted back into the human genome, if that's what you're asking.
