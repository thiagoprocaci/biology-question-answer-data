Usually in my experiences, I get primer dimers all the time, even if the reaction works and I get my bands of interest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe you ought to troubleshoot other aspects of your PCR that might account for why your reaction isn't working. Have you tried using a positive control with your primers? You may try varying the parameters of your PCR as well. Remember, standard Tms are calculated according to a 50mM salt concentration: is that what you're using? <\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, if the annealing temperature is above the predicted Tms of your primers, this represents a more restrictive and selective amplification of your target. You usually use a high annealing temperature if you're seeing lots of non-specific products. Since you're seeing no products at all, consider lowering the Tm to that of your primers (50º).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you start seeing non-specific products at that Tm, I'd do what we call a \"Touchdown\" PCR -- that is, you start the reaction at a higher annealing temperature, and as each cycle progresses, it \"touches down\" to a lower annealing temperature. The principle behind this is that it starts it off at a restrictive temperature -- so your yield is very low initially, but then by gradually decreasing the \"restrictiveness\" of the reaction, your yield will improve. This will still prevent non-specific amplification b/c the less restrictive amplification will be on the fragments already amplified from the restrictive condition. Remember, biology is not exact science. Just because something says the Tm is such and such does not mean it's absolute and doesn't give you some margin of error. For example, we exploit that margin of error to optimize our experiments in the example I outlined above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, (might have went on a tangent a little bit) you also have to consider how you designed your primers.

Instead, they have hemolymph whose primary role is not oxygen transport (they have an additional tracheal system for this purpose), but rather that of nutrients. <strong>Thus they don't need<\/strong> (and don't have) <strong>an intense proliferation of blood cell precusors<\/strong> -- these (bone marrow, spleen) are the most susceptible to radiation in a human and animal body.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Insects have a rather primitive immune system that is mostly humoral<sup>[a]<\/sup><\/strong>  and much less cellular<sup>[b]<\/sup> compared to the immune system of animals and humans. This eliminates the next common weak place in the body: lymphatic nodes, thymus, again spleen and bone marrow etc.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Insects have generally a much primitive<\/strong> and in many cases also rather <strong>decentralized nervous system<\/strong>: the ganglia are organized in a sort of a cord and even though the capital ganglia are usually larger, these dominance is not as prominent as in case of CNS and PNS in animals and humans. Therefore this system is much more tolerant to losses.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>1.-3. Therefore, the only sensitive part of insects is the intestinal epithelium which gets renewed on a regular basis (similar to that of humans, also a known target of radiation), but...<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Insects<\/strong> (and generally the arthropodes) are known to <strong>have exoskeleton<\/strong>. This potentially serves as a good \"armor\" for vulnerable intestine cells, filtering out the most heavy particles (like alpha- and in some respect also the beta-particles). \n<strong>EDIT<\/strong>: This seems not to be real protection, see the discussion in comments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Therefore it is not a surprise that insects generally show much higher resistance against radiation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong>:\nAs it was correctly added in the comments, there are also gamets, that are most sensitive to radiation (because they bear only the half of the normal genetic information and cannot repair mutations). Even though the lesions in gamets do not lead to immediate death, the potential sterility can easily cause the extinction.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, cockroaches (and insects generally) are known to be r-animals, meaning that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\">they favor the quantity (r) over quality (K) of their off-spring<\/a>. This strategy is optimal when dealing with radiation-induced changes in gametes: the high number of offsprings compensates for the genetic imperfections in gametes.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[a]<\/sup> -- meaning that is has secreted peptides in their hemolymph that protect them<br>\n<sup>[b]<\/sup> -- there are phagocytes, somewhat similar to tissue magrophages in humans, but the rest of the cell chains in immune response in vertrebrates, like T- and B-cells, are completely missing.

They hypothesise that sleep is necessary to replenish glycogen stores (mainly within astrocytes) in the brain.  These stores are normally used to supplement blood glucose due to the high energy demands of the brain.  <\/p>\n\n<p>It is suggested that this may also result in the manifestation of feeling sleepy as a consequence of the exhaustion of glycogen supplies in specific small areas of the brain.  Brief and localised depletion of glycogen stores mean that cells are operating with less energy than they normally have to work with.  This causes an increase in synthesis of adenosine from the breakdown of AMP.  The paper maintains that the increased levels of adenosine are detected by adenosine receptors which then triggers or increases (as seen on EEG scans) the feeling of the need for sleep:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jF4cA.jpg\" alt=\"Flowchart of the relation of glycogen to sleep need and replenishment\"><\/p>\n\n<p>In NREM sleep (which may lend some support to the theory as NREM sleep accounts for 80% of sleep and is most physiologically different to waking), this glycogen is most efficiently replaced.  During NREM sleep the release of glycogenolysis inducing neurotransmitters is reduced, allowing glycogen-synthase to predominate and glycogen levels to be restored.  However, these same neurotransmitters are key in the processing sensory stimuli (by tonically depolarising neurons in the sensory cortex).  <strong>Therefore glycogen replenishment will always be associated with a (strongly) reduced response to stimuli<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads to finally answering the question as to why sleep has an evolutionary advantage, which I will quote verbatim to maintain the authors momentum:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Glycogen replenishment during waking would be maladaptive because it would impair the organism's ability to to process and respond to sensory stimuli.  <strong>Sleep has therefore evolved as a state where animals retreat to a safe environment, behaviour is suppressed and glycogen stores are replenished<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":843,"question_id":324,"up_vote_count":23}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/324/why-did-the-process-of-sleep-evolve-in-many-animals-what-is-its-evolutionary-ad","last_activity_date":1327841762,"creation_date":1324739450,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why did the process of sleep evolve in many animals?

A high concentration of protons (in this picture the high concentration is found <em>above<\/em> the complex) allows each of the subunits in the membrane to be constantly loaded with H<sup>+<\/sup> ammunition, ready to fire when it comes to be their turn.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The function of this axel is to slightly but significantly change the shape of one subunit at at a time in the red part.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Changing the conformation of subunits in the red part is what allows for the three steps in ATP synthesis to occur: binding of ADP and P<sub>i<\/sub>, catalysis of the formation of ATP, and release of ATP. <\/p>\n\n<p>All of these changes occur at the molecular level.  The proton forms a bond with a single amino acid of the entire protein complex, but this is sufficient to cause a difference in the most stable 3-dimensional structure of the whole.  This could cause either a cascade of changes that result in a net rotation or it could cause a re-stabilization of the structure due to electrostatic forces.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to Vinit K. Rastogi &amp; Mark E. Girvin in their 1999 Nature paper on the subject, it's more like the former: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier models proposed simple rotational diffusion of a rigid c12 ring, possibly driven by electrostatic forces. The structural data on protonation-linked conformational changes in subunit c indicate that the process may be more mechanical, with local rotations within subunit c driving larger-scale rotations of the c12 oligomer as a whole, in a `wheels within wheels' type of mechanism. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/46224\" rel=\"nofollow\">whole paper's<\/a> a good read.

Evolution works by a mechanism where pressures on a population select for the traits that are best suited for that environment.  If there are no pressures on a population, then the selection of specific traits will be slowed down, as all members of the population have an equal chance at reproducing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now to wax a bit philosophical on the issue.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.factsnotfantasy.com/15.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">As John Rennie said in Scientific American<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Survival of the fittest\" is a conversational way to describe natural selection, but a more technical description speaks of differential rates of survival and reproduction. That is, rather than labeling species as more or less fit, one can describe how many offspring they are likely to leave under given circumstances. Drop a fast-breeding pair of small-beaked finches and a slower-breeding pair of large-beaked finches onto an island full of food seeds. Within a few generations the fast breeders may control more of the food resources. Yet if large beaks more easily crush seeds, the advantage may tip to the slow breeders. In a pioneering study of finches on the Gal pagos Islands, Peter R. Grant of Princeton University observed these kinds of population shifts in the wild [see his article \"Natural Selection and Darwin's Finches\"; Scientific American, October 1991].<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The key is that adaptive fitness can be defined without reference to survival: large beaks are better adapted for crushing seeds, irrespective of whether that trait has survival value under the circumstances. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.factsnotfantasy.com/25.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Shermer states<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Living fossils (organisms that have not changed for millions of years) simply means that they evolved an adequate structure for a relatively static and unchanging environment, good enough to maintain a niche.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Or as a particularly brilliant writer that goes by the name of <a href=\"http://factsnotfantasy.com/creationists.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calilasseia<\/a> said:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The static species fallacy.<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>This is a particularly stupid canard, which the above discourse on inheritance, and variation brought about by meiosis, should flush down the toilet at a stroke. But, in order to reinforce how stupid this canard is, it is necessary to cover rigorously what a species is.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A species is a population entity, and as a corollary thereof, a dynamic entity. A species is defined in rigorous biological work, as a population of living organisms, whose members can produce viable offspring with each other, but whose members can not produce viable offspring with a separate, distinct population. Actually, this is only one extant definition, but it is the one that matters with respect to evolution, because once again, it points to the central role of inheritance.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, part of the problem arises because of taxonomy. Because scientists need a reference point from which to launch further investigation, they have alighted, courtesy of our old friend Linnaeus, upon the process of cataloguing organisms and providing them with a unique, unambiguous identity. This, of course, has been most helpful in furthering our understanding of the biosphere, and indeed, Linnaeus himself, on the basis of comparative anatomy alone, alighted upon the idea that organisms were related to each other a hundred years before Darwin, which is why he constructed his taxonomic scheme in the manner he did. Yes, that's right, a creationist (though he was only a creationist because no other option existed in 1758) alighted upon the idea of biological interrelatedness, as a result of paying attention to reality. But the very same taxonomic practices that have been useful to science, have also led to a popular misconception. This is because taxonomists base their classification upon individually sampled organisms, one of which is chosen as a 'type specimen' that is henceforth declared to be the reference standard against which all others are compared. Other specimens are maintained in order to provide a record of likely variation in characteristics from that reference standard. The trouble is, of course, basing the entire classification system upon such reference standards promotes the illusion that those standards remain in place for all time. Scientists, of course, recognise that this is not the case, but it takes diligent intellectual effort to recognise that the taxonomic standards are merely particular snapshots of the state of the species at a given point in its history, which scientists then choose as their reference benchmark for current work. The species itself, however, courtesy of all that dissemination of variation across generations, does not stay still. It is NOT static.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I cannot reinforce this strongly enough. A taxonomic classification is merely a historical snapshot of the state of a species, used as a reference point for further work, and does NOT constitute \"the species\" itself. The species itself, is the sum total of all the living organisms comprising that interfertile population, and with each new generation, that population undergoes change, because in the new generation, each of the organisms comprising that population are genetically different from those in the previous generation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>So, if anyone wishes to erect the ridiculous idea that a species is a static entity, the simple retort is this. Look at your family album. Are you identical to either of your parents? No? There's your evidence for the dynamic nature of a species. Now replicate that evidence across millions of humans, and picture what happens with each new generation, remembering that across generations, inheritance is a dynamic process. There goes the static species fallacy.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope that clears it up for you.<\/p>\n","answer_id":590,"question_id":574,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1327522576}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/574/why-would-stablising-selection-ever-happen","last_activity_date":1327522576,"creation_date":1326228291,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why would stablising selection ever happen?","body":"<p>If the <em>aim<\/em> of evolution is to allow an organism to better compete against rivals, why would stabilizing selection ever happen?

The only way how this center can be ceased is to form another dominance center by a extremely high stimulus (for example a startle sound).

The presence of a 2'-hydroxyl group makes ribose ring prefer different <a href=\"http://online-media.uni-marburg.de/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/kapitel1e.html?/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/k1e-20.html\">conformations<\/a> than deoxyribose in DNA. Also, since 2\u2032-OH moiety is both a hydrogen donor and acceptor, it provides RNA with greater <em>flexibility<\/em> to form 3D complex structures and <em>stability<\/em> to remain in one of these conformations. As Aleadam notices, this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338076\">paper<\/a> shows that tRNA and its DNA analog form similar tertiary structures though tDNA is not as stable as tRNA:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, we submit that the global conformation of nucleic acids is primarily dictated by the interaction of purine and pyrimidine bases with atoms and functional groups common to both RNA and DNA. In this view the 2-hydroxyl group, in tRNA at least, is an auxiliary structural feature whose role is limited to fostering local interactions, which increase the stability of a given conformation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These authors also show that at least one loop in the tDNA analog is more susceptible to cleavage by a restriction endonuclease. In this region the tRNA has a water molecule hydrogen bonded to 2'hydroxyl group.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was not able to find more of such interesting comparisons in the literature.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Double stranded DNA and RNA<\/h3>\n\n<p>Both DNA and RNA can form double-stranded structures. Again, sugar conformation determines the shape of the helix: for DNA helix it's usually <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Nucleic_Acid/DNA/DNA_structure#Secondary_Structures_of_DNA\">B-form<\/a>, whereas helical RNA forms A-geometry under nearly all conditions. In RNA helix we find the ribose predominantly in the <a href=\"http://online-media.uni-marburg.de/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/kapitel1e.html?/chemie/bioorganic/vorlesung1/k1e-20.html\">C3\u2019- endo<\/a> conformation, as 2'-OH stericly disfavors the C2'-endo conformaion, necessary for B-form geometry.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Physiological significance<\/h3>\n\n<p>dsRNA and ssDNA often provide a signal to the cell that something is wrong. dsRNA is of course seen in normal processes like RNA interference but it can also stop protein synthesis and signal viral infections (cf. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-stranded_RNA_viruses\">double stranded RNA viruses<\/a>). Similarly, ssDNA is much more prone to degradation than dsDNA, it often signals damage of DNA, or infections from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_virus#Group_II%3a_ssDNA_viruses\">single stranded DNA viruses<\/a> and induces cell death.

It is certainly true that the pineal gland is part of the system that regulates the circadian rhythm (briefly, the daily sleep-wake cycle). However, while the pineal gland in birds and other non-mammalian vertebrates is directly sensitive to light, the mammalian pineal gland is not (see, for review, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18419310\">Doyle and Menaker, 2007<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16687306\">Csernus, 2006<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>In all animals, the circadian rhythm is regulated by a photoperiod cue and therefore requires light detection. In mammals, the light sensors are found exclusively in the retina, the sensory portion of the eye. There are two classes of light detecting cells in the retina. First, rod and cone photoreceptors mediate vision in the usual sense of the word. These cells contain proteins called opsins that absorb photons of light and thereby excite the photoreceptors that contain them, informing the brain that light was detected.<\/p>\n\n<p>A second class of photosenstive cells in the retina are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20959623\">Do and Yau, 2010<\/a> for review). These cells mediate \"non-image-forming\" vision and are an important part of the circadian rhythm pathway. They also contain an opsin called <em>melanopsin<\/em> which is a photosensitive pigment. This is not to be confused with <em>melatonin<\/em>, which is the sleep hormone released by the pineal gland. The ipRGCs in the retina send the photoperiod cue to a brain area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN then signals to the pineal gland.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we are generous and assume that these light-emitting headphones are the result of misunderstandings, we can guess that the confusion arises from (1) the fact that some animals have a directly photosensitive pineal gland, but not mammals and (2) that the pineal gland secretes melatonin but not the photosensitive pigment melanopsin.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>: From a bit of research, it turns out that the company selling the headphones is not \"confused\" as I politely offered.

Each aaRS belongs to either one of only two\n  classes with two different mechanisms of aminoacylation, making use of either the 29OH (Class I) or the 39OH (Class II) of the\n  terminal A76 of the tRNA and approaching the tRNA either from the minor groove (29OH) or the major groove (39OH). Here,\n  an asymmetric pattern typical of differentiation is uncovered in the partition of the codon repertoire, as defined by the\n  mechanism of aminoacylation of each corresponding tRNA. This pattern can be reproduced in a unique cascade of successive\n  binary decisions that progressively reduces codon ambiguity. The deduced order of differentiation is manifestly driven by the\n  reduction of translation errors. A simple rule can be defined, decoding each codon sequence in its binary class, thereby\n  providing both the code and the key to decode it. Assuming that the partition into two mechanisms of tRNA aminoacylation is\n  a relic that dates back to the invention of the genetic code in the RNA World, a model for the assignment of amino acids in the\n  codon table can be derived. The model implies that the stop codon was always there, as the codon whose tRNA cannot be\n  charged with any amino acid, and makes the prediction of an ultimate differentiation step, which is found to correspond to the\n  codon assignment of the 22nd amino acid pyrrolysine in archaebacteria.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Granted, this is a few years old, but I often find myself having to admit that \"I don't know\" when at the root of discussions on evolution.  That is, once abiogenesis has occurred, we can go on and explain the rich diversity of life, but sadly we really don't know much before that critical step.  Generally, those satisfied with \"magic\" as an answer posit their myths and fables, whereas I'd rather try to actually find out what happened.  Sadly, as the abstract shows, you actually need a level of education to understand papers such as this that is generally well beyond those who would deny the reality of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a collection of papers on abiogenesis that are more accessible and understandable to laypeople?<\/p>\n","question_id":399,"tags":["evolution","dna","abiogenesis"],"score":12,"accepted_answer_id":400,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":245,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1326675690},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b2790c74560690d1a476d9ee079a50b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":352,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/352/qazwsx","reputation":290,"display_name":"qazwsx","accept_rate":75},"closed_date":1326732333,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47073e025b05ee4d61d720f6424d0191?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":12,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12/gww","reputation":1920,"display_name":"GWW"},"score":4,"post_id":655,"edited":false,"creation_date":1326587443,"comment_id":673,"body":"Are these homework questions?

The cell \"allows\" it to break, but only at the cost of moving the phosphate to some other molecule, such as a serine or glycerol or fructose or whatever.  This phosphorylation creates a bond with lower energy than the phosphoanhydride, and so is overall favored.  Imagine the personification: the gamma phosphate hates being attached to anything, but hates being attached to an ADP the most.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if ATP hydrolysis is coupled via an enzyme, it is usually done through transient storage of the energy is protein conformation.  An enzyme binds ATP, which makes the protein structure \"bend\" or conform around the ATP.  This puts loads of strain (energy = A) on the protein which is offset by the stabilization of binding the ATP (energy = B).  This strain can make an enzymatic surface open up on the protein which itself takes a lot of energy to make (energy = C).  The surface can catalyze some reaction (X+Y->Z in your example) that costs some energy (energy = D).  The completion of that reaction alters the enzyme's catalytic site to something new and higher energy (energy = E), which can be alleviated by cleavage of the ATP (-7.3 kcal/mol).  Alas, ADP and P do not fit well into that site of the enzyme, so they float out, restoring that original ATP-binding surface to it's original state.

They might encode for the same amino acid, but organisms tend to favor specific codons over others and the tRNAs for those codons tend to be present in different concentrations. When you now have a lot of codons in your sequence that are very rare in E. coli, the expression will suffer because the tRNA for those codons is not present in high enough concentrations to sustain the translation.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two ways of compensating for that, either you get your E. coli to produce more of the rare tRNAs, or you optimize your sequence to use different codons. For the first solution you can buy certain E. coli strains that contain plasmids encoding the tRNAs that are rare in E. coli, one of those strains is e.g. the Rosetta BL21 strain. <\/p>\n\n<p>For optimizing the codon usage there are several companies offering to synthesize optimized sequences.

Initiation of translation<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>A key component affecting initiation of translation in prokaryotes is the <em>RBS<\/em> that occurs between 5 and 15 bases upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) AUG start codon. Binding of the ribosome to the Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD) sequence within the RBS localizes the ribosome to the initiation codon... <em>Affinity of the RBS<\/em> for the ribosome is a critical factor controlling the efficiency with which new polypeptide chains are initiated. This interaction is in competition with possible base-pairing interactions involving the RBS region that may form within the mRNA itself. Thus, SD sequences with weaker base pairing to the ribosome are more susceptible to interference from mRNA structure. However, some experiments suggest that SD sequences with too strong affinity can be deleterious, particularly at lowering temperatures, by stalling initial elongation. Also critical is the distance between the RBS and the start codon with 5-7 bases from the consensus SD AGGAGG being optimal.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the <em>initial 15\u201325 codons<\/em> of the ORF deserve special consideration in gene optimization. Studies have shown that the impact of rare codons on translation rate is particularly strong in these first codons, for expression in both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In E. coli, peptidyl-tRNA drop-off during translation of the initial codons appears to be accentuated by the presence of rare NGG codons. These effects appear to be independent of local mRNA secondary structure. It is also true that expression may be recovered by 5' sequence replacement even for sequences that do not show especially strong mRNA structure or contain rare codons or other obvious deleterious elements in this region.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>2. Codon bias<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The second way in which host codon frequencies can be used is to match the <em>host codon frequencies<\/em> in the designed gene. This can be done simply by choosing each codon with a probability that matches the host codon frequency...Using sets of genes broadly varied in gene design features, Welch et al. found that variation in synonymous codon usage frequencies had a profound effect on the amount of protein produced in E. coli, independent of local 5\u2019 sequence effects. Variation of at least two orders of magnitude in expression was seen due to substitution beyond the initial 15 codons of the ORF. This variation was strongly correlated with the global codon usage frequencies of the genes, although the codon frequencies found in the highest expressed variants did not correspond to those found in the genome or in highly expressed endogenous genes of E. coli. Multivariate analysis showed that the frequencies of specific codons for about six amino acids could predict the observed differences in expression. It is not clear what the biochemical basis is for this correlation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>3. mRNA structure and translational elongation<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>While much evidence suggests that mRNA structure can interfere with translational initiation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the effects of structure on elongation are less well understood. This in part may be due to intrinsic helicase activity of ribosomes, which allows translation through even very strong hairpins and may preclude many structures from limiting the translation rate in either prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Perhaps more importantly, mRNA structure is difficult to predict, particularly for actively translated messages which are in continuous flux between various folded and unfolded states.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>4. Protein-specific factors providing additional complexity<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The protein may be particularly unstable in the host, especially if it is poorly folded due to inherent instability, lack of sufficient prosthetic factors, or improper post-translational modification... Expression of secreted and membrane proteins may be limited by mechanisms for directing these proteins to the membrane. It is even possible that the protein amino acid sequence may limit translational efficiency. For example, proline is thought to be slowly translated in E. coli, regardless of which codon is used.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Expression of the protein may be <em>toxic<\/em> to the cell leading to instability of the expression vector or host suppression of protein synthesis...A common strategy to reduce toxicity is to lower expression to tolerable levels. Promoters varied in strength can be valuable tools for finding an optimal expression rate for maximal yield...One potential way to avoid toxicity of some proteins is to direct expression to the periplasm or media. This may be accomplished by N-terminal fusion of a secretion signal sequence.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For more information, please read the whole paper.

In this paper in Figure 1 the celebrated regulatory sequence of ENDO16 is <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/24/8591.full\">can be seen in Figure 1<\/a>. As you can see for almoat 2000 bp there are numerous binding sites for many sorts of promotors and inhibitory factors, as well as factors which may splice the gene in various ways.   <\/p>\n\n<p>As I recall, ENDO16 only  turns on for a brief period in the development of the sea urchin and so its very tightly controlled, which means that its got a lot of regulatory elements upstream of it, controlling transcription. Its one of the most exhaustively studied genes ever and the believe they have most of it.  Other human genes ive seen perusing medical literature have seen 20kb are necessary to reproduce the regulation of a gene. Still all this might at best only triple the amount of DNA actively involved.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Centromeres and Telomeres\nThe physiology of the chromosomes have large regions as Deniz mentions are necessary for cell reproduction and for development.  In animals (like humans) the regions are devoid of transcribed genes and might be 10-15% of the genome length (I'm eyeballing this from the UCSC genome browser on chr21 - in some organisms like yeast the centromere can be just a few hundred base pairs.  So anyway we are getting somewhere now!<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Non translated genes.\nThere are lots of pieces of DNA that might be copied into RNA and then do not function as templates for proteins.  some folks say there is a lot of this stuff.  The typical view is that there are a few thousand of these sorts of beasts known, and <a href=\"http://mirbase.org/cgi-bin/browse.pl?org=hsa\">humans are currently thought to have about 1500 of them<\/a>.  A small tweak in the number of genes, but they are there nonetheless.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chromatin binding and organization sites\nAlthough Centromeres are places where chromatin binds, the several families of proteins which bind DNA and wrap them <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome#Higher_order_structure\">into organized coiled coils thought to be like spools of telephone wire to form the Nucleosome<\/a> which makes the chromosomes look like the little stick men you see in text books.  Chromatin can spool up just about any sort of DNA but seems to have a preference for regions which are at the ends of genes.  They can be modified by enzymes (acylated, methylated) to modulate their affinity for some classes of DNA sequence.  This is a hot topic of research.  The ability for RNA polymerase to find transcribe a gene is not good if its wound onto chromatin and though its not a precise binding like a transcription factor, chromatin binding and regulation must be affected greatly by changes in the distance between genes and the DNA sequences which surround a gene for thousands of base pairs, which is one of the main differences between species.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Of all biological systems (at least that I know of) this one accounts for the most bulk DNA sequence and is probably as related to the difference between different species as transcription factors and almost certainly is an older system of gene regulation, if you think about it. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copy Number Variations and repetitive regions\njust a side note, but small and very long repeat sequences can show up in the intergenic regions as well as inside a gene boundary to account for some of the differences between individuals.  they can be quite short or quite long.  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Well hope this helps?<\/p>\n","answer_id":427,"question_id":328,"up_vote_count":10},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b77a5b0214128179e948ad8d73146adb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":117,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/117/dsign","reputation":276,"display_name":"dsign"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"score":1,"post_id":446,"edited":false,"creation_date":1325630943,"comment_id":475,"body":"Unfortunately, it can be shown trivially that self-replication isn\u2019t sufficient for being Turing complete (imagine the programming language \u201cRep\u201d which has a single command, \u201crep\u201d, which prints \u201crep\u201d; clearly this language allows to write self-replicating programs and clearly it isn\u2019t Turing complete)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b77a5b0214128179e948ad8d73146adb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":117,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/117/dsign","reputation":276,"display_name":"dsign"},"score":0,"post_id":446,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1325667497,"comment_id":478,"body":"@Rudolph: that&#39;s what I meant by &quot;specious&quot;.

Take a look, for example, to the existence of mobile genetic  elements: some of them are \"subprograms\" coding for reverse transcriptases which in turn are able to reproduce the original program. I must note that for doing this with a Turing-complete formalism like the lambda-calculus, well, you need to do a fairly long and complicated program: <a href=\"http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV26Larkin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV26Larkin.pdf<\/a> .  And the lambda calculus is \"easier\" than bare Turing-machines, meaning that you can write shorter programs than with Turing machines for doing the same thing. So, my (somehow specious) argument is that any real-world information machine capable of self-replication is with high likelihood Turing-machine equivalent. <\/p>\n\n<p>It just happens that the essential feature of mobile genetic elements is to ensure its survival, so, that's probably the reason we haven't found a fragment of DNA able to do something as interesting as calculating square root. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you refer to the part of DNA that can not do anything at all, well, for talking about Turing-machines and computation you need a way in which some \"data\" can be \"interpreted\"  as a program.

Many cells, including bacterial, fungal, plant, insect\n  and mammalian cells, can express recombinant GFP (rGFP) efficiently.\n  Several methods and procedures have been developed to purify the rGFP\n  or recombinant proteins fused with GFP tag. However, most current GFP\n  purification methods are limited by poor yields and low purity. In the\n  current study, we developed an improved purification method, utilizing\n  a FMU-GFP.5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to GFP together with a\n  mAb-coupled affinity chromatography column. The method resulted in a\n  sample that was highly pure (more than 97% homogeneity) and had a\n  sample yield of about 90%. Moreover, the GFP epitope permitted the\n  isolation of almost all the active recombinant target proteins fused\n  with GFP, directly and easily, from the crude cellular sources.

After it was recognized that\n  host specificity did not exist for many species, new strains (or\n  serovar, short for serological variants) received species names\n  according to the location at which the new strain was isolated. Later,\n  molecular findings led to the hypothesis that Salmonella consisted of\n  only one species,[16] S. enterica, and the serovar were classified\n  into six groups,[17] two of which are medically relevant. But as this\n  now formalized nomenclature[18][19] is not in harmony with the\n  traditional usage familiar to specialists in microbiology and\n  infectologists, the traditional nomenclature is common. Currently,\n  there are two recognized species: S. enterica and S. bongori, with six\n  main subspecies: enterica (I), salamae (II), arizonae (IIIa),\n  diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), and indica (VI).[20] Historically,\n  serotype (V) was bongori, which is now considered its own species. The\n  serovar classification of Salmonella is based on the Kauffman-White\n  classification scheme that permits serological varieties to be\n  differentiated from each other. Newer methods for Salmonella typing\n  and subtyping include genome-based methods such as pulsed field gel\n  electrophoresis (PFGE), Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis (MLVA), Multilocus\n  sequence typing (MLST) and (multiplex-) PCR-based methods.[21]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":85,"question_id":82,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a71658d81f8a82a8122050f21bb86d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":25,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/25/nick-t","reputation":1720,"display_name":"Nick T","accept_rate":75},"score":15,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user132"},"score":0,"post_id":88,"edited":false,"creation_date":1323957532,"comment_id":68,"body":"Nice survey article!

The only thing I would add is to explicitly mention the distinction between <i>axial resistance<\/i> and <i>membrane resistance<\/i> in cable theory.

Basically, as the action potential (AP) propagates along the membrane of the axon, it's tripping voltage gated channels that \"renew\" the flux of ions into the stream at the nodes. There are no ion channels under the sheathing (or they are there anatomically and inactive, but I don't remember), so the current is able to zip through that area.  There's no renewal of AP, but there's no loss due to leak of ions either.  Since there's no influx of ions from outside of the membrane until the next node, the capacitance and resistance of the membrane is exponentially decaying the voltage.  So, if the distance between the nodes was too long, the voltage would just die off and the AP wouldn't propagate.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't have any anatomical data about individual species, but know that only the smaller diameter axons require sheathing to compensate for the slower ion flow due to higher resistance (e.g., the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_giant_axon\">squid giant axon<\/a>(not to be confused with the \"giant squid\" axon) has no myelination due to its large diameter).<\/p>\n","answer_id":63,"question_id":52,"up_vote_count":12}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/52/what-limits-the-maximum-spacing-of-nodes-of-ranvier-and-which-organisms-tend-to","last_activity_date":1323924030,"creation_date":1323905641,"answer_count":1,"title":"What limits the maximum spacing of Nodes of Ranvier and which organisms tend to have the widest gaps?","body":"<p>Assuming that a longer distance between gaps in the myelin sheath is beneficial for an organism due to the increased propagation speed, what is the limiting factor in determining the maximum spacing between nodes?
