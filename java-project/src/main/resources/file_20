Let's get into it step by step. The most important thing here is to understand that every single thing you do is a combination of many highly complicated biochemical and biophysical reactions/processes that slow down as temperature gets lower. Since any chemical reaction is a physical process I won't differentiate physics and chemistry any further. The speed of molecular processes is explained by thermodynamics. And in thermodynamics, all other things being equal, things slow down as the temperature gets lower, because temperature is a measure of thermal motion. Why? We will get to that later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, what are those processes we are talking about? I'm not going to list every single molecular cascade in a eukaryotic cell that has something to do with muscle contraction (there are many, believe me). Instead, I'll give you a beautiful example that is directly related to movement. That is innervation. Everyone knows that neurones use axons for long-range transfer of electric impulses. Although people tend to portrait axons as wires, they really are nothing like metal wires, because the resistance is so high any biologically feasible electric signal won't travel for long. So how do axons work? Let's look at one: <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8WXoO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8WXoO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a chain of Wi-Fi base-stations that retransmit a signal and you have a very good analogy. Any axon is mostly covered by glial cells, forming an isolation-coating (myelin sheath), but there are regular coating-free patches (Ranvier nodes). These nodes are the \"base-stations\". When a neurone sends a signal, it triggers the depolarisation of its cellular membrane by opening various ion-channels. The first Ranvier node senses the change in the electric potential and opens its own potential-sensitive ion channels, so the signal travels from node to node. In order the neurone to transmit a signal again, it has to recharge all the nodes (obviously, it takes time). The process is done by special active ion-pumps that use energy (ATP) to move ions against the concentration gradient. Now, let's list some thermodynamic processes:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Something senses the change in electric potential and changes its conformation. This is work.<\/li>\n<li>The movement of ions along the concentration gradient. This is diffusion.<\/li>\n<li>Something senses that the membrane is depolarised and triggers recharging. Once again, work.<\/li>\n<li>The movement of ions against the gradient. This is done by molecular machines that require ATP. So here we have at least 2 reactions: 1. an ATPase transforms ATP to ADP; 2. an ion-pump works. Hey, what is work after all? ;)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In fact, a similar list of processes can be given for the actin-myosin system that actually performs the muscle contraction, when the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca ions increases after they are set loose from the intracellular Ca-storage facilities (the reticulum) in response to a neuronal or mechanical signal. It's just another charge-shoot-sharge cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's return to thermodynamics. First, consider diffusion. Diffusion depends on the speed of the molecules. The speed depends on temperature. So this is clear and simple (if you don't want to know, why it does). Now, let's consider reactions. Any reaction/process is probabilistic. We call reactions \"fast\" when the probability is so high there is no lag between individual events. Where does that probability come from? Although details, such as free energy distribution model (e.g. Maxwell distribution in ideal gases), depend on the medium you analyse, the basic idea of any reaction is to reduce the potential of a system. Aside from concentrations, there are 3 basic things to consider: 1. the starting free energy, 2. the activation energy, and 3. the resulting free energy. Let's look at a picture.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RfcwH.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RfcwH.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The higher the difference between 1 and 3, and the lesser the difference between 1 and 2, the higher the probability. Okay, this doesn't completely explain why this stuff is probabilistic. The thing is that the starting free energy of reagents forms a distribution, hence only a fraction of molecules have the energy to break the activation barrier. Any time two molecules (that could possibly react) meet, you play a game called \"can we make the jump or not\". The game is clearly probabilistic. When you lower the temperature, you shift that distribution, reducing the fraction of molecules that can make the jump.\nNow we can go further into details, but I feel like this is already enough to give a sense of why things slow down as you lower the temperature. <\/p>\n","answer_id":42397,"question_id":41989,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1453103076}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41989/why-do-my-muscles-move-slowly-when-cold","last_activity_date":1453103076,"creation_date":1451864007,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do my muscles move slowly when cold?","body":"<p>When my hands are cold, e.g. outside in the winter with no gloves for a while, their muscles begin to move slowly (assume I'm otherwise comfortably warm, e.g. dressed well but gloveless).<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't seem to lose strength or endurance really, only maximum speed.

There\u2019s no other species that does it. There\u2019s obvious reasons for that because we\u2019re the only ones that can make fire which is a pre-requisite. In a away fire comes first and cooking becomes a process after it. It\u2019s becoming clear that really cooking provides quite a number of advantages. Richard Wrangham from Harvard has been doing a lot of experiments looking at how cooking can change the nutritional value of food. What it seems is that the process of warming food up: in a sense denaturing it has a number of effects. One is that food is much more tender. That we know. If you eat a cooked carrot instead of a raw carrot it\u2019s much easier. We can spend less time chewing, we can swallow it faster and we can digest it faster. It seems that it\u2019s an extension of things we see in other animals. Animals who use techniques often in their stomachs to tenderise food seem to try and make it more easily absorbable. If we turn to the other question of when all this happened the real question is when do we first find evidence of fire? That seems to be about half a million years ago or so. We don\u2019t find direct evidence of cooking then but we do see over the next 100,000 years or so the beginnings of things like burnt stone which suggests that meat is cooked. It\u2019s probably goes quite a long way back in our evolutionary history and some people would argue it\u2019s really a very major change in the way we are able to live and survive. <\/p>\n\n<p>The second possible advantage for cooking is that it improves digestion. We\u2019ve done a model study here particularly with Zhongquan Sui when she was here \u2013 she\u2019s now at the University of Perdue. She found that yes, cooking does to a certain extent improve digestion. You only need cook something for a fraction of the time that you actually do in order for it to be digested properly. The cooking times that people adopt when they normally say this is cooked seem to reflect strong mechanical changes in the food. In other words, these are things that affect you perception of food texture and allow you actually to eat it very much easier, very much shorter eating times than you would do if they\u2019re raw. That I think I would give as the essential answer at the moment.\n<hr>\n<strong>References<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6910/title/Ant_Iron_Chefs_Larvae_fix_dinner_but_dont_sneak_snacks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6910/title/Ant_Iron_Chefs_Larvae_fix_dinner_but_dont_sneak_snacks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thenakedscientists.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thenakedscientists.com/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":42424,"question_id":42422,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1453093980}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42422/do-any-animals-prepare-food","last_activity_date":1453093980,"creation_date":1453059301,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do any animals prepare food?","body":"<p>I was just wondering if any animals (are smart enough to) enhance the flavor of their food by, for example, mixing ingredients or seasoning or letting it cure in some ways.

However, when fermentations are conducted in media containing an equal concentration of glucose and fructose, glucose is utilized at approximately twice the rate of fructose. The preferential uptake of glucose also occurred when sucrose, which was first rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose by the action of the enzyme invertase, was employed as a substrate. Similar results were observed in the fermentation of brewer's wort and wort containing 30% sucrose and 30% glucose as adjuncts. In addition, the high levels of glucose in the wort exerted severe catabolite repression on maltose utilization in the Saccharo~ myces uvarum (carlsbergensis) brewing strain. Kinetic analysis of glucose and fructose uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a Km of 1.6 mM for glucose and 20 mM for fructose. Thus, the yeast strain has a higher affinity for glucose than fructose. Growth on glucose or fructose had no repressible effect on the uptake of either sugar. In addition, glucose inhibited fructose uptake by 60% and likewise fructose inhibited glucose uptake by 40%.

First of all, I recommend you to look a little bit about the most popular definitions of species and, more importantly, how speciation can occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>I can picture a problem of hybridization when I think of your question. Since speciation takes many (plentiful) generations to happen, and as I can remember, can involve sympatric speciaton and/or extinction of the parent's species since the new one won't be enormously different in matters of food request, habitat and other physiological needs (generally) and so there will be a conquest/fight for resources (you can look out for more details in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species). All this to say you won't have a newton coming out of a frog's egg. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>But hybridization can lead to speciation, and you can have a hybrid coming out of an egg of a well descripted species. This happens with more frequency in fishes, insects and amphibians. For example, you can study individuals that are phenotipically different from their parents, with other types of adaptation (sometimes better) to the environment, and that emerge from different (and phylogenetically proximate) diploid sexually reproducing species... and the resulting individuals can have, of course, di/tri/tetraploid genomes...

Of course, whether each female will keep reproducing as much depend on whether the carrying capacity is high enough, and typically a logistic model might be a better fit than this exponential model."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73cb4730cf40c0297fe57a2fd07f7e2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13409,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13409/joshua-benabou","reputation":173,"display_name":"Joshua Benabou"},"score":1,"post_id":35839,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"edited":false,"creation_date":1436246920,"comment_id":58965,"body":"Yes that is not a rigorous calculation."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"post_id":35839,"edited":false,"creation_date":1436274356,"comment_id":59011,"body":"Well, it is.

However, the comment from @Remi.b is apt, in the sense that it shows that population growth rate per se (or reproductive rate) should not be the limiting factor. The bottleneck will probably be some concept of carrying capacity (the number of tigers that the current tiger habitats can sustain). This number will naturally depend on many factors, for instance whether all hunting of tigers and their prey is removed from the remaining habitats.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could arrive at a ballpark estimate of the current \"theoretical\" maximum population size by finding the area of suitable tiger habitat and dividing this by the average size of tiger territories. However, the size of tiger territories differ quite a bit between males and females and between areas with different prey densities, and probably also between different tiger subspecies (which will covary with average prey density to some extent - Siberian tigers generally live in habitats with lower prey densities). Looking at estimates from <a href=\"http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GreatCats/tigerfacts.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Smithsonian<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger#Social_activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>, territory sizes seems to range between 20 to 510 km<sup>2<\/sup>, with maybe even larger male territories in Siberia (so quite a big range). The <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15955/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">IUCN Red list assessment of tigers<\/a> state that the current tiger range is to 1.185 million km<sup>2<\/sup> (from <a href=\"http://www.panthera.org/sites/default/files/WCS_WWF_et_al_2006_TechAssesment_Wild_Tigers_2005-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanderson et al. 2006<\/a> as \"<em>Tiger Conservation Landscapes<\/em>\"). It is however unclear whether this number corresponds to the total range extent or to the actual amount of suitable habitat (probably the former though). Nevertheless, lets say that the average territory size is 265km<sup>2<\/sup> (probably way to high on average), that the estimated area from IUCN is correct, and lets assume that territories never overlap (which they do; male territories overlap with several female territories and female territories can also overlap to some extent). In that case, we will arrive at an estimated theoretical popultion size of ~4500 tigers. If we instead use a more modest territory size of 40km<sup>2<\/sup> we will arrive at a population size of ~30000 tigers. Since territories can overlap, these estimates should be biased low, given their other assumptions. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.panthera.org/sites/default/files/WCS_WWF_et_al_2006_TechAssesment_Wild_Tigers_2005-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanderson et al. (2006)<\/a> however also includes a summary of \"<em>Effective Potential Habitat<\/em>\" of tigers, which sum to 5.65 million km<sup>2<\/sup>. If this number is used to calculate the estimated theoretical popultion size you will arrive at ~21300 or 141000 tigers, using the same territory sizes as above. However, this completely ignores issues such as landscape connectivity, and that tigers are completely missing from large parts of their former distribution (these factors, and others, were used to define the \"<em>Tiger Conservation Landscapes<\/em>\"). Also note that much of the potential habitat lies in low-productivity areas (Russia and parts of China), where territory sizes are relatively large.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another perspective would be to use the historical population size pre-20th century and the amount of decrease in tiger habitat to estimate a theoretical population size. I don't know anything about the historical population size, but let's say that your 100000 is accurate (source?). <a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/6/508.full#F1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Dinerstein et al. 2007. The Fate of Wild Tigers. Bioscience 57 (6): 508-514. doi: 10.1641/B570608\">Dinerstein et al (2007)<\/a> state that current tiger ranges correspond to 7% of historical ranges. Using only these numbers, you could arrive at a current theoretical population size of 7000 tigers (100000*0.07), assuming that the tiger population should directly mirror the amount of available habitat. However, the current 7% of historical ranges include range contractions due to hunting, so this estimate should be biased low (maybe strongly so) with respect to the possible population size that could be obtained if all hunting stopped.<\/p>\n\n<p>These calculations should show that the current Tiger populations could probably be increased quite a bit with strong and effective conservation efforts (in your words: if \"<em>poaching and habitat destruction stopped today and conservation efforts were increased drastically<\/em>\"), but that 100000 will probably be extremely hard to obtain, given that so much of the historical range has been lost. With reintroduction programmes and a long timeframe it doesn't appear to be impossible though, but this is ignoring potential future problems such as increased tiger-human conflicts. Also note that I don't know much about Tiger biology, that these are merely rough back-of-an-envelope calculations, and an expert could certainly give you a more detailed and accurate answer.<\/p>\n\n<h2>References:<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/6/508.full#F1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Dinerstein et al. 2007.

The genus Populus (poplars, cottonwoods and aspens) contains approx. 30 species of woody plant, all found in the Northern hemisphere and exhibiting some of the fastest growth rates observed in temperate trees. Populus is fulfilling the \u2018model\u2019 role for a number of reasons. First, and most important, is the very recent commitment to sequence the Populus genome, a project initiated in February 2002. This will be the first woody plant to be sequenced. Other reasons include the relatively small genome size (450\u2013550 Mbp) of Populus, the large number of molecular genetic maps and the ease of genetic transformation. Populus may also be propagated vegetatively, making mapping populations immortal and facilitating the production of large amounts of clonal material for experimentation. Hybridization occurs routinely and, in these respects, Populus has many similarities to arabidopsis. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(from Taylor, 2002))<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the completion of the Populus trichocarpa genome sequence and the development of various genetic, genomic, and biochemical tools, Populus now offers many possibilities to study questions that cannot be as easily addressed in Arabidopsis and rice, the two prime model systems of plant biology and genomics.

For example, if you hold a paper up to your face you will find that the left side of the face is different than the right side, or at least that is the way it is for most people. Thus, once conceived, the two sides of the face grow differently, a phenomena that geneticists call genetic \"expression\". For example, your fingerprints are \"expressed\" traits, not genetic traits, and for this reason the fingerprint on your left thumb is different than the fingerprint on your right thumb.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even genetically, however, many parts of the body are not symmetric. For example, the heart is on the left side of the body, but the liver is on the right.<\/p>\n\n<p>The evolutionary logic for symmetry probably is because it makes locomotion easier and more effective.

Sperm and egg are called germline cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>The billions of somatic cells in a <em>homo<\/em> <em>sapien<\/em> have the same 46 chromosomes. 23 ( half) of them came from dad and 23 from mom. Thus we say somatic cells have two copies of each chromosome and it is abbreviated 2n. The germline cells are 1n or just n.<\/p>\n\n<p>So your sperm has 23 chromosomes and after sexy time one of them can combine with an egg (which also has 23) to produce a cell(called a zygote) that has an entire complete genome (46). Then that zygote splits, and splits and splits.... And each time before it splits, <strong>all<\/strong> 46 <strong>chromosomes are copied<\/strong> (the copies are called sisters, or sister chromatids, respective to each other). The cells split into two new cells called  daughter cell and each daughter has an entire genome. This form of cell splitting is called mitosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Probably the most important event in the cell cycle is the duplication of every DNA stand. This is called a Synthesis (S) phase. This is not a component of mitosis! It's a required event that happens before mitosis. So all 46 chromosomes get copied and then during mitosis each copy (an identical copy) is attached to each other at a region called the kinetachor. A kinetachor attaches sister chromatids (each sister is a copy of each other).<\/p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of mitosis a web forms in the cell and you can think of the strands that make the web as sliding chains that can pull stuff from the center of the cell to 1 of two perimeter locations (poles) of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>The chain like web attaches to the kinetachor and it rips apart the pair of chromosomes, rips apart the sisters. So that one sister goes to one side of the cell and the other sister chromosome goes to the other side of the cell. So now at opposite sides of the cell you have a complete genome (which will become the new daughter cells).<\/p>\n\n<p>An identical process occurs in meiosis (specifically meiosis II) which is part of the  process that forms the sperm and the egg. During meiosis however there's additional separation (separation of homologs which occurs in meiosis I) that occurs but it's really not pertinent to your question.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTd5c.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":30010,"question_id":30003,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1425346290}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30003/how-are-23-chromosomes-in-human-sperm-chosen","last_activity_date":1452891958,"creation_date":1425051849,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are 23 chromosomes in human sperm chosen?","body":"<p>I'm not biologist and I have just a basic knowledge.

This example explains what I mean:<\/p>\n\n<p>Say you have some sort of ground squirrel that lives in rocky outcrop(R).  Next to the hole is a field (F), and across the field are some trees(T) with squirrel food in them.  The squirrel spends all of its time in these three habitats, but it doesn't like the field much because its exposed and can be attacked by predators, so when it goes out for food it runs quickly across the field, gets food, and runs back.  Say it spends 60% of its time at home, 10% of its time running through the field, and 30% of its time in the trees eating.  Those give you your \"used\" numbers.  But, the relative proportion of the habitats that the squirrel ever occupies (relative size), are very different.  By area, the field is 75%, the trees are 15%, and the rocks are 10%.  In this example, your \"used\" matrix would look like this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>used\n            R    F    T\nSquirrel  0.6  0.1  0.3\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>and your \"avail\" matrix would look like this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>avail\n            R    F    T\nSquirrel  0.1  0.75  0.15\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>With this information you can do a statistics to test whether the squirrel randomly picks habitats, or prefers certain ones.  If it randomly picked habitats, you'd expect it's \"used\" percentages to look like its \"avail\" percentages, i.e. it spends ~75% of its time in the field because it just wanders around aimlessly between rocks, field and trees.  But since you observe a pretty sizable increase in time spent in low-availability habitats, you are likely to see a statistically significant preference for certain habitats (rocks for sure, and maybe trees).<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, if you have multiple species, this program probably tests to see how similar two species' patterns of habitat preference and avoidance are, and uses that to define niche overlap.  The \"avail\" could be the same if they both travel through the same rocks, field and trees, but if another species has a larger foraging area, its F and T percentages in the \"avail\" matrix will go up relative to the R.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, not totally certain about this interpretation, but it seems to make sense to me from the R documentation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13515,"question_id":13499,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/niche-overlap-index","last_activity_date":1452808855,"creation_date":1384508245,"answer_count":1,"title":"Niche overlap Index","body":"<p>I wanted to use the <code>compana()<\/code> function from the <code>adehabitat<\/code> package in R.

However, the flow of amniotic fluids around the fetus and its position in the uterus changes during the differentiation process. Thus, the cells on the fingertip grow in a microenvironment that is slightly different from hand to hand and finger to finger. The finer details of the fingerprints are determined by this changing microenvironment. A small difference in microenvironment is amplified by the differentiation process of the cells. There are so many variations during the formation of fingerprints that it would be virtually impossible for two fingerprints to be alike.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, fingerprints aren't entirely a genetic characteristic.

These pathways are outlined in the following quotes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is widely accepted that contact inhibition requires establishment of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell contacts and subsequent maturation of the adherens junctions (AJs) that link E-cadherin and F-actin in a synapse-like complex involving numerous other proteins<\/p>\n  \n  <p>One possible pathway involves β-catenin, a mediator of Wnt signaling, that, in addition to its function as a transcriptional cofactor, is associated with the AJs at the cell surface<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A contact inhibition role has been reported for NF2/Merlin, a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a membrane-cytoskeletal scaffolding protein, which most likely acts via the Hippo kinase pathway, controlling nuclear localization of the transcriptional activator YAP\u2014itself a known regulator of cell proliferation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Contact inhibition is known to involve the MAPK pathway, which, in turn, promotes cell cycle entry by regulating the expression of cyclinD1. Also implicated are Nectins\u2014a family of cell adhesion molecules that are involved, together with integrins and other proteins, in the regulation of cell motility and proliferation. <strong>Yet, this accumulated knowledge falls far short of a comprehensive picture of contact inhibition.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the article, the findings were as follows:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our findings show that contact between cells is not sufficient for inhibition of mitosis in MDCK cells. Instead, inhibition of cell proliferation is a consequence of mechanical constraint that causes successive cell divisions to reduce cell area.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Where, in the discussion, they note the following:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our measurements also suggest that inhibition of cell division is a distinct single cell state rather than a global state induced by cell-cell signaling across the layer, as illustrated in Fig. 4E. In fact, confluent MDCK cell cultures with an average cell density corresponding to the morphological transition are often sufficiently heterogeneous in local cell density that highly motile cells and completely arrested cells coexist in the same colony. Thus contact inhibition is a local phenomenon...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Published later, the article <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/15/5586.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spatial constraints control cell proliferation in tissues<\/a> showed that reducing the amount of space in a tissue prevented entry into S-phase. Actually stretching the tissue quickly reactivated the cell cycle, and compression lead quickly to arrest. More so, they found that cells had no memory of past constraint, and were able to suggest a model of growth in relation to spatial constraint. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm editing my question because the way I posed it initially, to me, was unanswerable. Being said, I suspect that at this point cell volume and extracellular contacts are synergistic. This is probably going to need two separate questions, but:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) How does the mitotic entry machinery roughly respond to cell volume? I'm currently reading into Cdc25/Wee1 regulation in addition to some stuff about <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736675/\" rel=\"nofollow\">internal fluidics<\/a> that are influenced by water, ion channels, etc. but I still don't fully understand.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) What's a relatively straightforward downstream pathway (core elements), starting at the adherens junctions, that illustrates how cell-cell signalling gets the STOP signal to the mitotic entry machinery (based on what we know)? This might require some much more in-depth knowledge about the field, however, but articles with some good figures are appreciated, too.<\/p>\n","question_id":30707,"tags":["cell-biology","cancer","cell-division","cell-cycle"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":269,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1452618450},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69d6c826a7f23b9b80e624e30c2c7290?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15307/emilyj","reputation":14,"display_name":"emilyj"},"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42258/ions-in-different-cell-compartments","last_activity_date":1452618075,"creation_date":1452618075,"answer_count":0,"title":"Ions in different cell compartments","body":"<p>I would like to understand the distribution of metal ion concentrations (such as Mg2+) in the different cell compartments.

The quality scores computed for each\n  called <strong>base are written to the CWF and SFF files<\/strong> (and optionally to a file paralleling the basecall FASTA file). Briefly, the method\n  compares the properties of each base\u2019s flowgram signals against\n  properties that have been found to correlate with accurate and/or\n  error-prone signal information, using training sets of read data. A\n  multivariate analysis of those properties determines the sets of\n  property values that best describe \u201cbins\u201d of basecalls, then assigns\n  the training set accuracy rates of the basecalls in each bin as a\n  quality score using the following scale: <\/p>\n  \n  <p>$$Q = -10\\ \\text{log}_{10}(\\text{error rate})$$<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Usually, you'll have two files for 454 experiments &mdash; one that holds the sequence and the other that holds the quality at each position.

The wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\" rel=\"nofollow\">FASTQ<\/a> page that you link in your question describes some (not sure if all) the different alternatives.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, why do we have this wide range of characters for the quality scores comes down to the question of what these characters really mean. What we really care is about the probability that a particular base has been assigned incorrectly. This is the base call error probability (p). We can define a quality score based on the error probability as:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>q = -10 x log10(p)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>So, if your base call is truly wrong (probability of error <code>p = 1<\/code>) then <code>q = 0<\/code>. If your base call is certainly correct (<code>p = 0<\/code>) then <code>q -&gt; Inf as p -&gt; 0<\/code>. Imagine your probability of error is <code>p = 0.0001<\/code> (that is, most likely the base is correctly assigned). Then <code>q = -10 * log10(0.0001) = 40<\/code>. Therefore, a score of <code>q = 40<\/code> means a probability of error in that base call of <code>1/10000<\/code>. Quality scores are considered, as far as I know, between 0 and 40.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, another issue is how to include this information <em>for each base<\/em> in the FASTQ file. It would take too much storage space to include the score as a real value number (i.e. with decimals). A possibility instead is to round it- after all there is no much difference between a score of say 39.7 and 40- we care more about the order of magnitude. But then we will have to still store two digit integer numbers per base. What we can do is <em>map the rounded score to the corresponding ASCII character + some offset<\/em>. That is, as you can see in the FASTQ page the ASCII value for character <code>I<\/code> is 73. If you are using phred-33 encoding this actually means that character <code>I = 73<\/code> corresponds to quality score <code>q = 73 - 33 = 40<\/code>, which means <code>p = 0.0001<\/code>. Voila. Character <code>! = 33<\/code> represents score <code>33 - 33 = 0 (p = 1<\/code>). In a phred-64 representation a score <code>q = 40<\/code> is encoded with character <code>h = 104<\/code>. Then <code>q = 104 - 64 = 40<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course this is just a rough approximation about how the actual phred score is mapped. Phred is actually the name of a program that was developed to maps the quality scores to ASCII characters.

You must have both strands in place for a DNA polymerase to stop by. Moreover, the catalytic activity of all the polymerases requires a preexistent 3' end on the growing strand. You must have a 3' free end near a template, for a DNA polymerase to act.

Once a cell decides to replicates, its ori-binding proteins are synthesized and/or activated. They bind the DNA template, and bring in the primase. Only after the primase does its job, DNA polymerase can take over. The cell needs stringent regulation only at the level of the ori-binding protein, because DNA polymerases are so strongly dependent on the preceding steps.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we think in evolutionary terms, and we accept the RNA world hypothesis, the RNA polymerases (or at least their ancestors) should have evolved earlier than the DNA polymerases.

The country you are writing from matters. There are some rabies virus variants that have a relatively low pathogenicity for humans (dog rabies is one of these; a relatively large innoculum is required, i.e. a bite, commonly a deep one with lots of virus-laden saliva.) The likelihood of canine-associated rabies developing from a non-bite exposure is extremely low; in fact, the exact risk is unknown.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the US, enzootic (dog-to-dog) canine rabies virus has been virtually eliminated through vaccination and stray control programs, making wild animals (including feral cats) the primary concern. Depending on the country your friend lives in, dogs may not even be high on the list of worrisome sources.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding canine-associated rabies,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabies control was accomplished [through dog vaccination programs, responsible pet ownership, and serious population control of stray dogs] in Europe, North America, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you don't live in one of these countries/continents, dog-associated rabies is still a major concern. If you do live in the mentioned areas, you can probably dip your hand in dog saliva and not be concerned.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rabies is usually contracted by a bite; that is most common.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most dangerous and common route of rabies exposure is from the bite of a rabid mammal. An exposure to rabies also might occur when the virus, from saliva or other potentially infectious material (e.g., neural tissue), is introduced into fresh, open cuts in skin or onto <em>mucous membranes<\/em> (nonbite exposure). ...Exposures to bats deserve special assessment because bats can pose a greater risk for infecting humans under certain circumstances that might be considered inconsequential from a human perspective.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>how exactly does the process of infection happen, and how can it happen?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>exact way<\/em> it happens is not completely understood, but that answer won't help you convince your friend of anything. The virus is <em>usually<\/em> deposited in tissue near a cutaneous (peripheral) nerve. If it gains entry to the nerve, it makes its way to the brain with the typical disastrous results.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Having said all this<\/strong>, your friend is not going to stop worrying, because the virus is only the focus of an irrational fear. Though the foci of irrational fears are fairly stable, OCD is most likely the underlying problem, and conventional rational discourse doesn't really suffice in curing the obsession.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>During 1990-2007, <strong>34<\/strong> bat-associated human cases of rabies were reported in the US: <strong>6<\/strong> cases reported a <strong>bat bite<\/strong>; <strong>2<\/strong> cases reported a <strong><em>probable bite<\/em><\/strong>; <strong>in 15 cases, physical contact was reported<\/strong> (e.g., the removal of a bat from the home or workplace or the presence of a bat in the room where the person had been sleeping), but no bite was documented; and <strong>in 11 cases, no bat encounter was reported<\/strong>, but the rabies virus was bat-specific.<\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><sub><em>Any encounter with a bat, even a dead one<\/em> (as stated above), <em>must be evaluated for possible post-exposure prophylaxis.<\/em><\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><sub>Unfortunately, in the US, animal rabies is common, and at least 23,000 persons/ year receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). (It is probably considerably higher, as no reporting mandate exists.) With the elimination of canine rabies virus variants and enzootic transmission among dogs, human rabies is now rare in the United States, with an average of one or two cases occurring annually since 1960. <\/sub> <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>In the US in 2013, of the three human cases reported, 2 were involved in organ transplants (raccoon rabies virus variant) and one was a Guatemalan (canine rabies virus variant).<\/sub> <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>In 2012, one human died from an <em>exposure<\/em> to a bat.

It may also be used to describe a physical process in which any solvent moves across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations.

You might want to have a look to the wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">sex-determination systems<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Long answer<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Diversity among the species that reproduce sexually<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Not all species that have sexual reproduction have sexes. Yeasts for example have mating types but no sex.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Diversity among the species that have sexes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Sex is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In some species genetic factors is more important than environmental factors in other species it is the reverse. Species which sex is mostly determined by the genetics are said to have GSD (Genetic Sex Determination). For example humans are GSD, as the female is XX and the male is XY. The species where sex is mostly determined by the environment are called ESD (Environmental Sex Determination). For examples, crocodiles are ESD as sex is determined by temperature. It is important to understand however that there is a whole continuum between these two extremes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Diversity among the species that are GSD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Among the species that are GSD, some have sexual chromosomes some don't. Some have one locus  (=position on a chromosome) that determines the sex, some have many loci (=plurial of locus). Humans for example have sexual chromosomes (X and Y) and have only one locus which determines the sex. This locus is called SRY and it codes for a protein called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testis_determining_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">TDF<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you can split GSD with sexual chromosomes into two more categories (it is a bit more complex in reality): <code>XY<\/code> and <code>ZW<\/code>. <code>XY<\/code> are those species where the male is heterogametic (<code>XY<\/code>), while the female is homogametic (<code>XX<\/code>). In <code>ZW<\/code> systems, the male is homogametic (<code>ZZ<\/code>) and the female is heterogametic (<code>ZW<\/code>). Birds and some plants have ZW systems for example, while mammals (except \"basal\" mammals) and Drosophila have <code>XY<\/code> system.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Extra Information<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dosage Copensation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There is also a impressive diversity of strategy in order to face the issue of having a different number of copies of genes in species that have sexual chromosomes. Have a look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosage_compensation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dosage Compensation<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Comments on this diversity of sexual systems<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The diversity in sex-determination system, dosage compensation and other things related to sex is impressive. It is even more impressive when we look at how many independent origins there are. Below are some other examples.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Amazon molly (a fish) is a species that have sexual reproduction but there are no males. The females have to seek for sperm in a sister species in order to activate the development of the eggs but the genes of the father from the sister species are not used. (see <a href=\"http://classic.rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/817.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite\" rel=\"nofollow\">hermaphrodites<\/a> including sequential hermaphrodites (first male, then females or the opposite) in plants and animals. There are also species where populations are made of hermaphrodites and females and others where there are hermaphrodites and males (very uncommon).<\/p>\n\n<p>In some species, the sex is determined by social factors. In clownfish the sex is determined by comparing its own size with the size of the other fishers living in the same anemone.<\/p>\n\n<p>In an ant species (or two species actually), males and females can both reproduce by parthenogenesis (some kind of cloning but with meiosis and cross-over) but they the meet they reproduce together and their offsprings are sterile workers. So males and females are just like two sister species that reproduce sexually to create an army to protect and feed them.

Can you maybe say a word about how you coded the information about the car and how to interpret a mutation? Would be great to have a snapshot of the parent population on the side to understand that we have a population and not just a series of random individuals. +1"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7f09ec1f6f4ff748b51ee33a753af75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10193,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10193/vonjd","reputation":441,"display_name":"vonjd","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":42207,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"edited":false,"creation_date":1452460977,"comment_id":72323,"body":"@Remi.b: Thank you, I appreciate your feedback.
