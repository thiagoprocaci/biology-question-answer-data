In 1942 the famous biologist\n  Ernst Mayr wrote that because biologists have different ways of\n  identifying species, they actually have different species\n  concepts.

The question of which species\n  concept is best has occupied many printed pages and many hours of\n  discussion.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Some debates are philosophical in nature. One common disagreement is\n  over whether a species is defined by the characteristics that\n  biologists use to identify the species, or whether a species is an\n  evolving entity in nature. Every named species has been formally\n  described as a type of organism with particular defining\n  characteristics. These defining traits are used to identify which\n  species organisms belong to. But for many species, all of the\n  individuals that fit the defining criteria also make up a single\n  evolving unit.

(see also \n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lions and Tigers<\/a>)<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Mayr's response to cases like these is that the reproductive barriers\n  that are important for species are the ones that occur in the wild.\n  But even so it is also the case that there are many cases of different\n  species that are known to hybridize and produce fertile offspring in\n  nature. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia Species Problem<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The Phylogenetic Species Concept also has its problems: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it permits successive species to be defined even if they have evolved\n  in an unbroken line of descent, with continuity of sexual fertility.\n  However, because slight differences can be found among virtually any\n  group of organisms, the concept tends to encourage extreme division of\n  species into ever-smaller groups. <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/phylogenetic_species_concept.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phylogenetic Species Concept<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>When does a dog stop being a dog?

I am having difficulty finding evidence either supporting or contradicting this claim.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if there is evidence that suggests mutations in CYP1A2 (and therefore inability to properly metabolize caffeine) are associated with caffeine intolerance, or if there is another proposed mechanism for caffeine intolerance?<\/p>\n","question_id":7544,"tags":["genetics","pharmacology","metabolism","enzymes"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":7565,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":551,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1363419159},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1201ee68557b4ff23db59f300946c86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1893,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1893/dtech","reputation":253,"display_name":"dtech"},"score":4,"post_id":5732,"edited":false,"creation_date":1357772370,"comment_id":8232,"body":"Testosterone injections do not increase libido in healthy adult men: <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-11/aps-tdr113001.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-11/aps-tdr113001.php<\/a> (at least not more than a placebo)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"score":0,"post_id":5732,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1201ee68557b4ff23db59f300946c86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1893,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1893/dtech","reputation":253,"display_name":"dtech"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1357778908,"comment_id":8235,"body":"@dtech what about teenagers?

If modeling is required, then the typical paradigm is agent-based modeling, and a good introductory book is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yoav Shoham and Kevin Leyton-Brown\n  [2009], \"Multiagent systems:\n  algorithmic, game-theoretic, and\n  logical foundations\", Cambridge\n  University press.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As for actually building the model, and what to describe/how, I will take you through my usual procedure since this is a field I specialize in:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Define what type of strategies you think are relevant to the interactions you are modeling. Select what you expect the payoff of those strategies to be. For instance, if you are studying the evolution of cooperation, you might select 'Cooperate' and 'Defect' as your strategies and the Prisoner's dilemma as your pay-off matrix, but maybe you will pick something <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/uv-space/\">more general<\/a>. Unfortunately, in most of EGT a clear distinction between genotype and phenotype is not drawn, and they are usually equated. At the end of this step you have a game matrix G. Sometimes when mutation or innovation are explicitly necessary even in the inviscid model, further analytic approaches are taken at this stage. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2003-40-04/S0273-0979-03-00988-1/home.html?pagingLink=%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fjoursearch%2Fservlet%2FDoSearch%3Ff1%3Dmsc%26jrnl%3Dall%26msctype%3D2000%26timingString%3DQuery%2Btook%2B100%2Bmilliseconds.%26v1%3D34D20%26startRec%3D1%22%3E\">Hofbauer &amp; Sigmund (2003)<\/a> for a broad treatment of step 1.<\/li>\n<li>Now you need a basic intuition of what the 'default' behavior in this interaction is, so solve the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_equation\">replicator dynamics<\/a> of G.<\/li>\n<li>The main interest in EGT right now is <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/spatial-structure/\">structured populations<\/a>. This is where computational modeling is typically used. However, before I turn to simulation, I first try the best analytic approach I know. I use the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform on G to analytically solve the interaction for <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/random-regular-graphs/\">random graphs<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519306002426\">(Ohtsuki &amp; Nowak, 2006)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>If I am still interested in the question, and steps 2 and 3 didn't capture all the subtlety of the system I want to study, then I start building a multi-agent computational model. I make sure that my model has some way to scale to the completely inviscid case of replicatory dynamics, and the simply-structured case of ON-transform. If my computational model disagrees with the analytic approach in these regimes, then I become worried. Otherwise, I continue with standard agent-based modeling techniques. Personally, I code in Matlab. I have never seen a modern EGT simulation that required the performance of C/Fortran. As suggested in another answer, if you don't have a programming background then you can use <a href=\"http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/\">NetLogo<\/a>. However, my experience is that the models are typically simple enough to implement from scratch, and NetLogo models typically hide from you some very important subtleties (like which reproduction rule to use: death-birth, birth-death, immitation?) and usually lead to weaker papers. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Note the broad theme. These models are typically described as differential equations, and this approach is preferred to agent-based models. However, if a clean differential equations approach does not capture all the subtleties of what you are studying, then an ABM paradigm is adopted.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3500,"question_id":3487,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1347280939}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3487/how-exactly-are-game-theoretical-evolutionary-models-described-during-implementa","last_activity_date":1363280290,"creation_date":1347196751,"answer_count":3,"title":"How exactly are game theoretical evolutionary models described during implementation for computer simulations?","body":"<p>When a biologist or a layman tries to reason the evolutionary explanation for something, they would simply use English with some math thrown in (for a random example, pick any explanation out of \"The Selfish Gene\" -- for example, the reasoning why \"discriminate in favor of one's own eggs\" strategy is employed by Guillemots, in \"Genesmanship\" chapter, page 103.

There is never a reason to omit P values, statistical power or some other measure that you have done something that is not a random outcome. <\/p>\n\n<p>For the sake of reference lets define the terms you reference:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance#Effect_size\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eta squared<\/a> is a ratio of the variances of two sets of measurements\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cohen's d<\/a> is a measure of the difference between two means.<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient\" rel=\"nofollow\">R value or Pearson Correlation<\/a> describes the linearity of two numbers, usually one of them being a measurement and the second being an experimental variable.  <\/p>\n\n<p>These numbers as you say are descriptive, but they could be created by throwing coins and writing them up.  With small numbers of measurements, and a large enough range of possibilities, its possible to get terribly large numbers here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biology, medicine, social science and economics are really susceptible to this.  You go into the field and measure butterfly wings or do surveys of people's opinions, or try to guess who is going to win the election and its quite expensive to do more measurements.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are measuring something hard to determine because accuracy is important such as a close election race or that is really complicated such as which genes convey a susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (a problem which remains unsolved because so many genes play a role) you need large numbers of responses.  Yet each study that comes out gets some answer, but if you want to believe it these numbers should convince no one in most cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Microarray data and RNASeq data analysis for instance often suffer from this problem.  The measurements are all statistically significant but each one costs hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  Most experiments do a minimal three measurements to understand the variance in each measurement and then do 2 to 8 actual measurements.  That's not going to so revealing when working with a system with thousands of genes in it. one bad sample with slightly different culture conditions can ruin the experiment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Our butterfly biologist may measure 100 butterflies and stop when the P values are 0.05 or 0.001 - its a lot of work camping out and setting nets.  The truth is that 5% is a number that can happen at random a lot.  Even a 0.1% error will happen in one in ten such experiments.  In thousands of experiments published that means that 10% of them have a mistake.  Not so great. <\/p>\n\n<p>It gets worse though - not only significance, but <strong>bias<\/strong> needs consideration.  Because biologists and most other scientists don't understand statistics, the assumptions that we use when we calculate a P value are often inappropriate and don't give honest estimates of the chance that this is a random phenomenon. <\/p>\n\n<p>If good looking result is chosen specifically to show to prove the point or some data are thrown out because they simply don't look good, or if a hypothesis is chosen in a biased way simply to fit an unreliable set of data.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Or the statistical assumptions of the calculation might simply be so inappropriate that to really cite them is an out and out lie. An everyday example of this is to do a BLAST search.  The E-value calculations, if read as a P value would be wrong, even though they are mathematically correct - two strings that show a 10% identity will have a small E value - 10^-8 for instance, but this is only the chance two strings of these lengths will have so many letters in common.  Anyone who plays with BLAST will quickly throw out anything that has less than 30% identity unless they are desperate, even though the E-values are infinitesimal.  <\/p>\n\n<p>John Ioannidis has made this subject his focus and has published widely on this topic.  A good place to start is his commentary <a href=\"http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False\"<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":7508,"question_id":7505,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7505/are-descriptive-statistics-sometimes-more-useful-than-tests-of-significance","last_activity_date":1363096224,"creation_date":1363055093,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are descriptive statistics sometimes more useful than tests of significance?","body":"<p>How does the biology community currently feel with regards to publishing descriptive and effect size statistics rather than significance stats?  Almost every journal article I read in the cell biology field almost always reports things like P values and stats tests to report statistical significance, but should effect sizes be more important to a biologist?  Do we even care if something is statistically significant if the effect size is negligible?  Rather than crunch for significance, could one get away with showing things like confidence intervals, eta^2, Cohen's d, and r values instead over P values?  P values tell you the odds that if you assume the null hypothesis is true, then the observation you're making are only 5%(assuming of course P&lt;0.05).  However, this can lead to the logical fallacy as noted by Aristotle--theory A predicts that changing X will cause Y.  An experimenter thus performs experiments to manipulate X and sees changes in Y, therefore he/she concludes theory A is supported, which is however completely wrong.  Theories B, C, D, E....... could all also predict that X changes Y and may even be better at it.  Even if you conclude that your findings \"support\" theory A, it's still weak because you haven't ruled out all of the other possibilities.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So in order to avoid statistical significance relative to null hypothesis that has all sorts of pitfalls, can one just use descriptive and effect size statistics just as effectively, if not more so?<\/p>\n","question_id":7505,"tags":["biostatistics"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":287,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1363075053},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf262c003649e1d60dbb85dff0a5a0c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":1889,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1889/erik-redburn","reputation":19,"display_name":"Erik Redburn"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":5,"post_id":5707,"edited":false,"creation_date":1357665014,"comment_id":8205,"body":"What do you mean by &quot;theoretically&quot;?

I think that carriers can be formulated to carry a small molecule through the skin into circulation, so I don't even know about lipophilicity. I believe if you spend enough money, you can overcome many of these problems.  I think that pharmacology might be just as important. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think the first condition of a transdermal administration is that the drug cannot be effectively administered orally.  This is the most cost effective route go get a pharma compound into the body. It requires no devices, no fancy coatings or vaporizors.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Reasons that a pill (or its less popular cousins the suppository and sublingual tablet) cannot be used as the delivery system for a drug include effect of pH and other degradation of the compound in the GI tract, absorption rate from the GI tract and other factors such as effect of food in the system, other drugs which might interact in the system. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another advantage of absorption through the GI tract is that this is the physiological system which is meant to be ingested and introduced into the body - its relatively fault tolerant, even if less of the drug actually reaches the blood stream.  There's more, but that's not a bad outline.  <\/p>\n\n<p>After pills and the like, the second choice is intravenous administration, which puts 100% of the drug into the circulatory system.   This has its own disadvantages, requires a clinical setting and the needle and breaking of the skin are not ideal in many cases.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If the drug needs continuous and non clinical administration there are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Application_location\" rel=\"nofollow\">many other means of drug delivery<\/a>, including transdermal administration.  Differentiating these methods often includes making sure the drug is available specifically to the part of the body that needs it.  E.g. topical administration; putting on a medicated cream for a skin condition or use of an inhaler which delivers the drug directly to the lung for an asthmatic condition.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Transdermal administration has its own specific advantages; continuous distribution of the compound over long periods of time.  Disadvantages include: poor ADME properties for biologicals like antibodies and other proteins, low delivery concentrations where you need a large amount added (epinephrine, and maybe antibiotics come to mind).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Examples of successful transdermal delivery are testosterone gels and the nicotine patch.  Both of which apply continuous controlled low dosage that is important there.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal#Transdermal_pathways\" rel=\"nofollow\">three typical routes of drug absorption in transdermal delivery<\/a>.  The drugs can diffuse through the membranes of dead cells of the stratum corneum, which works if the drugs are lipophilic enough.  They can diffuse around these cells, through the intercellular spaces, which can work for more polar drugs although this path is not usually as efficient.  The most extreme means are patches which contain tiny needles that can deliver straight through the protective layer of the skin.  With enough economic investment probably any sort of compound could be introduced through a patch.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Most of this is just cribbing off the notes from this lecture on coursera: <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/pharm101-2012-001/lecture/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fundamentals of Pharmacology<\/a>.

A key molecular mediator in hippocampal functions,\n  including learning and memory, is brain-derived neurotrophic factor\n  (BDNF). BDNF mRNA is reported to be decreased following chronic (every\n  day) immobilization stress (CIS) in the rat, however the effect on\n  protein is unknown. Utilizing a mouse model of CIS, the hypothesis\n  that total hippocampal BDNF protein, in addition to BDNF mRNA, would\n  be decreased was tested. The effects of intermittent (alternating day)\n  immobilization and cold stress on hippocampal BDNF protein levels was\n  also examined.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In this study it was demonstrated that CIS results in a small (8 per\n  cent decrease relative to non-stressed controls), but significant (p =\n  0.0013) decrease in the exon coding for mature BDNF (exon VI). In addition, there was a significant (34 per cent, p = 0.005) decrease in\n  the mRNA coding for exon I in the stressed animals. Contrary to\n  expectations, however, CIS resulted in a significant (116 per cent, p\n  = 0.0087) increase in hippocampal BDNF protein levels. Furthermore, both intermittent immobilization and chronic cold stress both\n  increased BDNF protein levels. Chronic stress, therefore,\n  differentially regulates BDNF mRNA and protein levels in the\n  hippocampus.

For tryptophan the double ring\n  of the molecule is associated with the bulky letter W. The letters N\n  and Q were assigned to asparagine and glutamine respectively; D and E\n  to aspartic and glutamic acids respectively. K and Y were chosen for\n  the two remaining amino acids, lysine and tyrosine, because, of the\n  few remaining letters, they were close alphabetically to the initial\n  letters of the names.

Type II topoisomerases is special among eukaryotic topoisomerases, considering they use divalent metal ions and ATP hydrolysis in their active site. The enzyme cuts both strands of the DNA helix simultaneously (double strand break) in order to manage DNA tangles and supercoils. It changes the linking number of circular DNA by ±2. After the ends are cut, the ends of the DNA are separated and a second DNA duplex is passed through the break. The cut DNA is re- ligated. This allows the enzyme to increase or decrease the linking number of a DNA loop by 2 units. Inhibiting enzyme-mediated DNA ligation means that it prevents the enzyme to re-ligate the DNA strand after it is cut. In other words, the prevention of a phosphodeister bond between nucleotides.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second question:<\/p>\n\n<p>In normal cells, DNA topoisomerase II plays several vital roles, mainly to relieve DNA tangles and coiling. This is done by generating \"transient double strand breaks\" in the DNA strand, which can sometimes cause harmful translocations and damage. Damage of this type is linked to certain specific types of leukemia. This intrinsically \"harmful\" quality of DNA topoisomerase II can be exploited in cancer cells due to their high replication rate . Certain cancer drugs, such as etoposide, act by altering the active site of topoisomerase II, preventing (inhibiting) the enzyme from ligating cleaved DNA molecules, causing permanent DNA breaks (and inhibiting replication). The fast replication rate of cancer cells ensures that there are large amounts of the enzyme present in the cell, increasing the effectiveness of any Topoisomerase II poisons. However, this drug can also act against some other types of tissues with large amounts of Topoisomerase II, such as cardiac tissue. Also, cancer cells are constantly in a growing/replication cycle, so they exhibit large amounts of the isoform Topoisomerase IIa, the type that is most likely to produce permanent and detrimental DNA breaks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647315/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647315/<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":7291,"question_id":7209,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1361414181}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7209/how-does-topoisomerase-ii-inhibition-affect-cancer-cells","last_activity_date":1361414181,"creation_date":1360886648,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does Topoisomerase II inhibition affect cancer cells?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Topoisomerase II poisons represent some of the most important and\n  widely prescribed anticancer drugs currently in clinical use.

I don't know if I can list them all!  In no particular order: <\/p>\n\n<p>1) Living things that are large are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law\">more metabolically efficient<\/a>. The amount of food required goes as a 3/4 power of the size of the animal.  Thus a cat 100 times the mass of a mouse requires only 31 times more food.  I don't believe that it is not known how this works. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory#r-selection\">r vs K selection<\/a>: larger animals have greater individual \"value\".  Smaller animals tend to live by r-selection - they are cheap and reproduce in large amounts, then lead short and highly competitive lives where most offspring die without reproducing.  Larger animal tend to live longer and reproduce offspring with a greater chance of life. In the extreme case you can compare a cockaroach to an elephant here.  This is not a hard and fas rule, but cheap offspring do tend to be small.<\/p>\n\n<p>I seem to remember that there are lots of other surveys done and body size correlates to life span and any number of other attributes, which I will try to add after I get some sleep unless someone slips in and lists them all. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cope%27s_rule\">Cope's rule<\/a> - an observation as much as a rule that size must convey some advantge because most animals become larger the longer they are around.  Not <em>always<\/em> true, but there is a trend that the longer evolution works, the more likely a large animal will show up.

The more saturated a fat is, the straighter it is. Methylene groups cause kinks, which disrupts the Van der Waals forces along the rest of the carbon chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>As such, from the link above again:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"On the other hand, the introduction of one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain in unsaturated fatty acids results in one or more \"bends\" in the molecule. The geometry of the double bond is almost always a cis configuration in natural fatty acids. These molecules do not \"stack\" very well. The intermolecular interactions are much weaker than saturated molecules. <strong>As a result, the melting points are much lower for unsaturated fatty acids.\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(3) Ionized state of the fatty acid.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This will have a very minor affect. The fatty acid generally has an unpaired ester (-ate at the end) which can have a negative charge. However, from the link above <em>again<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\"However, in fatty acids, the non-polar hydrocarbon chain gives the molecule a non- polar character.\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So even if the ester had a charge, the negative character is miniscule compared to the intermolecular forces exerted by the non-polar tail. Particularly since the charge can distribute amongst the two oxygen molecules which are conjugated, reducing the reactivity further.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(4) Degree of saponification.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not super-familiar with the degree of saponification, but from a quick overview of the process I'd say this wouldn't affect melting point - counter to my comment. The process of making soap involves only the acidic portion of the fatty-acid triglycerides. That portion of the macromolecule is going to be pretty much the same regardless of the fatty acid, so it will have nearly the same reactivity regardless of its chain length and conjugation. <\/p>\n\n<p>What will not saponify are usually waxes - which are pretty much fully-saturated hydrocarbon chains with very few (if any) acidic sites. Parafin Wax, for instance, does not saponify, and has the formula ${C_{31}H_{64}}$.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(5) Ability to alter entropy of water.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Like the degree of saponification option above, the ability of a fatty acid to alter the entropy of water correlates to the number of reactive sites throughout the molecule. As-such, unsaturated fats (those with methylene groups) are going to be slightly more reactive as pi-bonds are more reactive than sigma bonds. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, given that this answer relies on a previous option, it's probably better to go with the previous option.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, if I were answering the question I'd choose <strong>1, 2<\/strong> since the rest either depend on those two or are miniscule.

There is almost certainly not a 'one-fits-all' answer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Most very big land mammals are herbivores and there is an advantage in having a large digestive tract when you eat a lot of plant material with a fairly low nutrient level.  However, when there are also predators around, getting big and slow might be more of a disadvantage than staying small and fast. With evolution there is often a balance of competing forces which are traded of against one another.<\/p>\n\n<p>Where large mammals have become isolated on islands with no predators, such as a species of now-extinct elephant on the Flores Island, they tend to become smaller so this suggests avoiding predators by simply being too big for them to kill might be an important factor.<\/p>\n\n<p>And of course with many species we have the effect of sex-selection. If females select for the biggest males, there will be a selection pressure towards greater size.<\/p>\n\n<p>With plants it could be something else entirely. Trees, for example, have long trunks basically for one of two reasons. <\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly to put their leaves and seeds out of the reach of herbivores, so we have a kind of arms race like that between giraffes and acacia trees in Africa.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, when they grow in close clumps like woods and forests, there will be competition for sunlight and soil resources like water. A species which can reach higher and put it's leaves above those of it's neighbours will win the competition and there will also then be pressure on it's neighbours to evolve longer trunks.  Long trunks mean that water must be pumped a long way to the leaves so the tree with the longest trunks will also need bigger root systems.  Again a trade off between making a long trunk and dominating the water supply underground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many trees are also believed to have formed symbiotic associations with fungi in their root systems which help them take in the nutrients and water required to 'service' a long trunk and high-up leaf crown so they may be the only types of plants capable of doing this anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing you might like to think about is why some whales are very big and some are relatively small (dolphins, porpoises, killer whales).

In this case an animal may arrive on an island and some of the predators or competitors that it is used to will not be there.  Then a single species will spin off many species, each one will fill one of the niches that are unfilled on the island - eating bugs from bark, breaking open nuts.  The lack of large carnivores will allow a nice juicy herbivore to get larger without fear of being eaten.  Similarly the Moa was a bird that became an aggressive carnivore in its island habitat, where it's very rare to see an aggressive land bird when a big cat or other carnivore is already present.  Such large changes in environment can also result in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/island-dwarfism/\">dwarfism<\/a> - smaller species as smaller animals like squirrels or mice might not be present to consume all the food that are available.  The <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090123-hobbit-skull.html\">Hobbits<\/a> recently discovered in Indonesia are an example of island dwarfism. <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, selective pressure can probably make many animals larger or smaller - lots of the dog breeds are smaller than wolves that they descended from.  I think steers are as large as we can make them and are larger than native cattle stock. <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the environment that caused dinosaurs to be so large, the higher levels of oxygen on the planet at the time is a common theory for why they were so large.  I also think that at least early on, the selection conditions that favored larger animals were probably put in place as animals evolved without any competitors whatsoever (first animals on land or sea).  If this were to happen again, its not clear whether dinosaurs would have been so large - perhaps we could have had gigantic mammals or descendants of trilobites. <\/p>\n","answer_id":1778,"question_id":1767,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c16e4dd8a9fad591be4904e4bf5a83f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":748,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/748/james-waters","reputation":61,"display_name":"James Waters"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1361201949,"creation_date":1334461037,"body":"<p>It needs to be recognized that this is an outstanding question in biology, i.e., there is no certain answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>This review considers the various theoretical and empirical evidence for phenotypic selection on body size:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blanckenhorn WU (2000) The Evolution of Body Size: What Keeps\nOrganisms Small? <em>Quarterly Review of Biology<\/em> 75: 385-407.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Some have hypothesized a connection between body size and the evolution of endothermy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clarke A, Portner HO (2010) Temperature, metabolic power and the\nevolution of endothermy. <em>Biological Reviews<\/em> 85: 703-727.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>And others have suggested a link to oxygen in the atmosphere:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Harrison JF, Kaiser A, VandenBrooks JM (2010) Atmospheric oxygen\nlevel and the evolution of insect body size. <em>Proceedings of the Royal\nSociety B: Biological Sciences<\/em> 277: 1937.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>And I'll throw this hypothesis into the ring.

He cut up plastic and put it in a yeast medium (growth medium for microorganisms) for a few weeks.  It says he tweaked the temperature and other incubation conditions for a few weeks and got a significant degradation of the plastic in the media.  The microorganisms in the media were not characterized.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That article is great because the bloggers compiled a list of similar work.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of links that point to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172303801767\" rel=\"nofollow\">styrene degradation<\/a> by <a href=\"http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/147/4/973.full\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Pseudomonas putida<\/em> variants<\/a>.  <em>Pseudomonas putida<\/em> is a likely candidate from bacteriology - it was first isolated near chemical and petroleum spills - they can degrade petrochemicals and organotoxics, so researchers might tend to start with this bacteria or an isolate of it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es060408h\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper<\/a> identifies <em>Phanerochaete chrysosporium<\/em>, a white rot fungus as an organism that can degrade phenolic resins.  White rot fungi are found in wood rot and can degrade lignin which is derived from a poly-phenolic like biosynthesis pathway.  So this is also an interesting lead.  It doesn't always grow to industrial scale - I've known people working on this even in the early 80s. <\/p>\n\n<p>So it seems despite the fact that plastic never seems to go away, there are organisms in the wild that will chew away at the plastic, and with a little bit of selection work you can pick them out pretty easily.  This <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110328/full/news.2011.191.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey of the plastic dump in the Pacific gyre<\/a> found that there were marine microorgs that might be eating plastic there too.

These included Pestalotiopsis microspora which seems to be have the so far unique property of anaerobic degradation of polyurethane.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Overall it seems that finding organisms in the wild is of ongoing interest.  This may be because biodegradation of plastic tends to be slow, which makes sense because if it were quick there would be no problem with dumping it into the dirt of into the ocean, but it would also rot over time in the back yard or in your boat.  While its possible that more fishing trips may find the perfect plastic eater, its also possible that industrial processes for the bioremediation of plastics may have to wait for some engineered organisms.<\/p>\n","answer_id":7241,"question_id":7237,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1361162584}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/what-plastic-eating-organisms-are-there-to-help-with-plastic-in-landfills-proble","last_activity_date":1361162584,"creation_date":1361121162,"answer_count":1,"title":"What plastic eating organisms are there to help with plastic in landfills problem?","body":"<p>I see some popular science articles on the plastic eating bacteria and fungi appearing on the web since 2009.

In your situation (pretty much identical to mine) I'd probably recommend Essential Cell Biology just as a start then move on to Molecular Biology of the Cell as everyone else rates it so highly.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Essential Cell Biology certainly has <em>some<\/em> kind of sense of humour:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6VGUF.png\" alt=\"Essential Cell Biology Back Cover\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Geek Spoiler:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n  <p> The bottom line reads <strong>C A G T<\/strong> whilst the top line reads <strong>G T C A<\/strong> in semaphore, two complementary strands of DNA bases acted out for your amazement...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":4997,"question_id":4995,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/4995/advice-on-cell-biology-texts-by-alberts","last_activity_date":1361130001,"creation_date":1350995679,"answer_count":2,"title":"Advice on Cell Biology texts by Alberts","body":"<p>I am currently reading \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chemistry-Life-Penguin-Press-Science/dp/0140272739/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350994643&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Chemistry of Life<\/a>\" by Rose.
