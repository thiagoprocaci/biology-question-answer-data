Most of it is the usual, unsurprising set of warnings about irritation to eyes and the respiratory system. However, there are LD50 numbers:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>LD50 Oral - rat - male - 161.2 mg/kg<\/p>\n  \n  <p>LD50 Oral - rat - female - 148.1 mg/kg<\/p>\n  \n  <p>LD50 Dermal - mouse - >512 mg/kg<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From this, we can conclude that one would have to eat quite a bit of capsaicin to die. If lethality in humans is exactly the same as rat (which it probably isn't),  a 70 kg human would need to consume about 11 g of capsaicin to reach similar levels of lethality.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Carolina Reaper, one of the hottest known peppers, averages about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper\">1.6 million<\/a> on the Scoville scale. Capsaicin amount is related to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#High-performance_liquid_chromatography\">Scoville heat units<\/a>, so we can make an imprecise conversion from one to the other.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using values given in 2 publications (<a href=\"http://www.sciencepub.net/newyork/ny0309/03_3176ny0309_17_21.pdf\">Nwokem 2010<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/16/10/8919\">Al Othman 2011<\/a>) we can observe the following trend:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jaTOQ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So on average, about $6.25 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ mg/g capsaicin per SHU. With this, we get $(1.6 \\cdot 10^5) \\cdot (6.25 \\cdot 10^{-5}) = 10$ mg/g, or 1% capsaicin for dry Carolina Reapers. To eat the equivalent of 11 g of capsaicin in peppers, you would have to eat 1.1 kg of dry peppers - which should be a couple of dozen.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, I think we can conclude that it is relatively \"feasible\" to consume a dangerously large amount of capsaicin by eating very spicy peppers. However, there are numerous caveats with my reasoning:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Human LD50 and rat LD50 are not necessarily the same.<\/li>\n<li>Toxicity is not necessarily linearly related to body weight.<\/li>\n<li>Peppers have compounds besides capsaicin that contribute to hotness.<\/li>\n<li>It would be very difficult to eat such a large amount of spicy peppers, and various involuntary reflexes would interfere. Even if one were force fed the peppers, I imagine the body would attempt to vomit it up - which brings up the question of how the toxicologists even managed to feed several milligrams of capsaicin to rats to measure the LD50.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":17903,"question_id":17902,"up_vote_count":16},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0382297f273df0a544b0c6c2734de096?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4038,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4038/michael-borgwardt","reputation":138,"display_name":"Michael Borgwardt"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"post_id":17910,"edited":false,"creation_date":1401966281,"comment_id":25737,"body":"Please include references"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1401965700,"creation_date":1401965700,"body":"<p>If you have cardiovascular problems, then it should be quite possible for the pain cause by spicy peppers to trigger a heart attack via a spike in blood pressure.

However, the author himself (Wilhelm Schulze) has stated and I quote <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"objective results presented for the captive bolt application in sheep\n  indicates that the captive bolt device used is suspect\" and that these\n  initial \"scientific findings and the results presented are only a very\n  first contribution\" and that they \"need to be followed as a high\n  priority by further investigations in the continuation of the\n  scientific clarification of the issues of loss of pain and\n  consciousness during slaughter of this kind with and without stunning\n  using the same experimental approach with a representative number of\n  grown cows of various breeds.\" (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Schulze\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Since stunning methods have advanced (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunning\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>) from the time this paper was published (1978), it would probably be a bit unfair to hold onto this paper as proof for supporting exsanguination.

The duration of brain function after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shechita\" rel=\"nofollow\">shechita<\/a>\n  was very variable, and particularly contrasted with captive bolt\n  stunning with respect to the effects on evoked responses. These were\n  lost between 20 and 126 seconds (means of 77 seconds for somatosensory\n  and 55 seconds for visual evoked responses) and spontaneous activity\n  was lost between 19 and 113 seconds (mean 75 seconds) after slaughter (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3381436\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The two questions that have to be answered in exsanguination are<\/p>\n\n<p>-- Does the neck cut cause pain?<\/p>\n\n<p>-- How long does it take for the animal to lose enough blood for insensibility to occur and for any perception of pain or suffering associated with slaughter to disappear?<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to pain, in the process of cutting the major blood vessels leading to and from the brain a number of other tissues are also severed by the extensive neck cut including muscle, skin, sensory and motor nerves etc. There is a chance that this might cause significant shock and fear to the animal.

Radiolaria are classified on the generic level, according to the classification utilized by [8]. Foraminifera above the species level are classified according to [9]. In addition, for radiolaria, the 20-63 μm fractions were soaked in peroxide, then washed with tap water and propanol.

From what I read there seems to be two reasons why you notice a reduction in bruising.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first would be because there is a deadening of nerve cells where they get used to the pain and eventually less sensitive. There could also be the development of some scar tissue from the bruising which has irregularly developed nerve endings leading to lesser stimulation.

I'm guessing these are the driving factors:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the cell membrane is nonpolar, so charged particles can only pass via transport proteins. This makes ion gradients an easy way to maintain a source of (literally, in the physics sense) potential energy.<\/li>\n<li>the cell needs to control its environment and send signals to other cells. The particle gradient (sodium, for example), allows it to accomplish these tasks: bring in glucose by co-transporting with sodium, send an action potential by triggering voltage-gated ion channels.<\/li>\n<li>Therefore, the Na/K pump is a way to \"charge\" the ability of the cell to perform various types of work in the future. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>To risk an analogy, a cell having a membrane potential is like <strong>you<\/strong> charging your cell in the morning.

Even without any voltage, diffusion forces would cause an inward sodium current and an outward potassium current if you made holes in the membrane. The NaK pump (and the other active pumps/exchangers) are much slower than the passive currents through ion channels when they open.<\/p>\n\n<p>(2) The resting potential is a dynamical equilibrium. This means that the potential you end up with is simply the one where all the opposing forces are equal. If you were designing a new cell from scratch you could put it at other values than around -80mV without too much trouble. In the cells we have, there's this region around -80mV where sodium and calcium channels are closed but a particular Potassium channel is wide open. Because there is much more Potassium inside the cell than out, diffusion drives Potassium out of the channel. However, because K+ has a positive charge the negative potential drives the K+ right back in. These two forces are able to balance each other out at around -80mV.<\/p>\n\n<p>(3) A cell uses its membrane potential in two important ways: Firstly, when you trigger an action potential (AP) in one cell, it almost immediately triggers an AP in its neighbours. This allows rapid communication between neurons in your brain, but also allows for the coordinated contraction of your heart. Secondly, the action potential opens up Calcium channels which let Calcium flow into the cell. The free calcium concentration within a cell acts as a second messenger initiating all sorts of actions. For example, in muscles the increased Calcium triggers a contraction: muscle cells contract during their AP.

But the term cyclic applies to both.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_peptide\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion<\/a> of 'cyclic peptides' (wiki entry) generally which are classified 'according to the types of bonds that comprise the ring.' But they are cyclic because of the circular molecular structure notwithstanding considerable variation in the atoms (or multiplicity of bonds) comprising the ring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biochemistry has inherited much nomenclature from organic chemistry, and informal usage in textbook organic chemistry is that ringlike structures are called 'cyclic' whether they are comprised entirely of carbon or contain another element (typically N,O,S, etc.); for example 'cyclic ethers'--oxacyclopentane is a cyclic molecule containing oxygen.   <\/p>\n","answer_id":17844,"question_id":17838,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1401751348}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17838/how-are-cyclic-hormones-characterized","last_activity_date":1401751348,"creation_date":1401717330,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are cyclic hormones characterized?","body":"<p>I have a question regarding the description of a subset of peptide hormones, called cyclic hormones.

These hormones possess a single disulfide loop, giving them a cyclic (circular) topology.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question relates to the chemical definition of cyclic in this context. Does the word cyclic imply any chemistry that forms a single loop topology, arising from any kind of chemical bond (e.g., C-C bonds in carbon rings, or S-S bonds in these hormones). Or, does the word cycling only apply to S-S bonds in the context of these hormones?

So the answer is: it depends; some immediately, some only very slowly.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the highest level, the current neuronal firing state of the brain encodes memory on a very short scale - working memory. The memory held on this level does not have a clear anatomical counterpart (but for the <em>potential<\/em> encoded in the synapses). It equals very short-term memory/STM sequences, such as the words you read just before you read the words you're reading right now. This memory is lost immediately when you lose consciousness, at least to some degree; as this memory is hard to even strictly distinguish from consciousness and attention (though see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17854286\">Jonides et al. 2008<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Other forms of short-term memory/STM are stored in a slightly different form: short-term potentation, the adaption of neuronal responses following brief and intense stimulation. Spike Frequency Adaption/SFA is at an intermediate stage between this and the previous level. Short-term potentation and SFA decay within minutes or even seconds if they are not transferred into some more durable form of memory.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long-term memory (/LTM) stores have specific anatomical correlates; they are stored in, amongst others, the synaptic weights (i.e. the amount of influence the firing of one neuron has on another). Some forms of LTM are best located in cortical synapses, others in the hippocampus. An even more fundamental, long-term, durable storage form is the wiring itself; not just the weights, but the existence of a synapse between two points, or not. For example, an important part of early learning is synaptic pruning, where synapses which do not play a meaningful role die off, whereas those which connect functionally related brain areas remain.\nThis pruning instantiates one form of learning, and the <em>non-existence<\/em> of a synapse is a form of memory. Synapses are comparatively stable. Even if the corresponding neurons die, in principle, the synapses still exist - and more importantly, the nonexistence of a synapse is even more durable. This form of memory can be observed in slice preparations of animals long dead.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a simple example, consider any experiment on the neuronal responses in slice preparations, which can be considered a form of (decontextualised) memory access.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the most extreme end, epigenetic adaptions and large-scale brain anatomy (which shows developmental traces) can be considered a form of memory that will remain intact until the whole structure rots away.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the more direct answer to the question the OP is asking is that once a large amount of neurons have died (brain death), there is currently no power on earth that can access a non-trivial amount of memory. As long as this is averted, nontrivial amounts of memory can be recovered.\nFor the parts that are lost immediately, see the source by Jonides et al. For more durable memory, you could look at for example <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10799/\">Purves et al, Neuroscience<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17822,"question_id":17728,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1401693019}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17728/how-long-does-it-take-for-memory-to-disperse-after-death","last_activity_date":1401702088,"creation_date":1401298753,"answer_count":2,"title":"How long does it take for memory to disperse after death?","body":"<p>1: There seem to be cases where coma patients with a non-active brain (i.e. flat EEG) have regained full consciousness. => Apparently memory and knowledge are stored independent of brain activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>2: There seem to be animals (e.g. hamsters) that can be frozen to complete organic inactivity and will regain full functionality after being thawed. => Apparently the stored memory does not depend on blood flow and other support.<\/p>\n\n<p>3: From this I assume that quickly cooling a human brain to a temperature low enough to avoid decomposition would preserve the state of that brain that corresponds to that human's memories, knowledge, cogntivie abilities, and maybe consciousness at the time of cooling. => With the proper technology that \"content\" is theoretically retrievable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Q: <strong>How long would that state remain after death in a brain left at room temperature?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Or in other words: How long does it take for decomposition to destroy memory?<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Addendum:<\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that the stored memory may not be accessible with current means is not relevant to my question.

Upon activation, mast cells \"degranulate\" and exotcytose the contents of granules.<\/p>\n\n<p>SNARE-dependent mechanism mediates exocytosis of neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines. Exocytosis of MCG is also SNARE-dependent. SNARE proteins are a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that facilitate docking of apposing membranes and facilitate the fusion of membranes to accomplish exocytosis. The characteristic feature is a SNARE motif, a stretch of 60-70 amino acids, arranged in heptad repeat. This feature allows SNARE motifs of the individual SNARE proteins (from opposing membranes)  to zipper together, forming a core complex of a four helix bundle. The major SNARE proteins involved in mast cell degranulation include VAMP-8 (integrated in mast cell membrane), SNAP-23 and syntaxin-4 (both plasma membrane bound)\u2060. There are other layers of regulation of course.

In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, PKC regulates several different stages of the exocytotic process, suggesting that these multiple actions of PKC are mediated by phosphorylation of distinct protein targets. In recent years, a variety of exocytotic proteins have been identified as PKC substrates, the best characterized of which are SNAP-25 (25 kDa synaptosome-associated protein) and Munc18. In the present study, we review recent evidence suggesting that site-specific phosphorylation of SNAP-25 and Munc18 by PKC regulates distinct stages of exocytosis. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":17399,"question_id":17349,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b0ce066c340b96d5ae9b1cc4cb6d53d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5263,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5263/au101","reputation":186,"display_name":"Au101","accept_rate":20},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1401502669,"creation_date":1401502669,"body":"<p>Having returned to this topic, I found this very handy journal article:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fimmu.2012.00130/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fimmu.2012.00130/full<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Much of it, I'm afraid, is very difficult for me to follow, but I still managed to take a lot from it and I hope others may find it useful.

In a paper by Dr Alwin Kienle titled <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085227\">Why do veins appear blue? A new look at an old question<\/a>, the authors measured how much light of various wavelengths was reflected from both real blood vessels in skin and imitation vessels in a skin-like environment. The synthetic vessel (which was a capillary tube filled with blood and placed in a milky substance with optical properties similar to skin) allowed the authors to experiment with a variety of parameters (particularly vessel depth and diameter), and they were then able to validate their results by taking measurements on actual vessels in skin. They eventually came to the conclusion that the optical properties of skin and blood is what makes the veins appear blue. <\/p>\n\n<p>I quote from the paper as to the reason of blood appearing blue. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Blue light does not penetrate as deeply into tissue as red light.\n  Therefore, if the vessel is sufficiently deep, the reflectance in the\n  blue will be affected to a lesser extent. Deoxygenated venous blood\n  has a greater absorption coefficient than oxygenated arterial blood in\n  the red spectral region, and this difference of two, rather small,\n  values is amplified because of the long path length of red light in\n  scattering tissue. As a result, veins are more likely to look blue\n  than arteries at the same diameter and depth. Often arteries are not\n  seen at all because they are generally smaller than veins and have\n  thicker vessel walls. It has been shown that a small vessel will look\n  red when close to the surface. However, if a superficial vessel is\n  large it can still look bluish, particularly in the case of the vein.\n  On the other hand, if the depth of a vessel is large, even red\n  remitted light will not be influenced by the vessel, and it will not\n  be seen.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So in short, the blue appearance could be attributed more to the location of the vein than just the deoxygenation. <\/p>\n","answer_id":17768,"question_id":17765,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17765/why-do-veins-look-blue","last_activity_date":1401432965,"creation_date":1401429150,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do veins look blue?","body":"<p>I know that veins carry oxygen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Veins look blue because the <strong>oxygen-depleted blood<\/strong> in them is blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this true??<\/p>\n","question_id":17765,"tags":["human-biology","blood-circulation"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":17768,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":885,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1401432965},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54a82fba3ce9f146c47e561b973f6adf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5851,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5851/caters","reputation":341,"display_name":"Caters","accept_rate":36},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIrIa.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5922,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5922/playsdice","reputation":646,"display_name":"PlaysDice"},"score":0,"post_id":17766,"edited":false,"creation_date":1401483332,"comment_id":24487,"body":"Wikipedia has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia\" rel=\"nofollow\">nice page on clotting disorders<\/a>  - it shows Hemophilia isn&#39;t a defect/deficiency of platelets, but rather due to defective clotting factors in the plasma.

However, it cannot maintain the chloroplasts and pass them on to the next generation but it acquires enough to appear green and survive on photosynthesis when there is no food. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also there case a cyanobacteria like organism has been acquired as an endosymbioint by the protist, <em>Rhopalodia gibba<\/em>. <em>Rhopalodia<\/em> already had a red alga derived secondary plastid before it acquired a \"<em>green<\/em>\" cyanobacteria.

For a discussion on why this is so, you can refer <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14347/the-origin-of-mitochondria/14351#14351\">this<\/a> post. \nHaving said that, there is an easy way to impart partial <em>photosynthetic ability<\/em> to a eukaryotic cell. Some archaea and bacteria employ rhodopsin to pump out protons against its gradient, in the presence of light; this is coupled with ATP-synthase just like the complexes of ETC in mitochondria.

Sure, the system is quite complex, but he himself points out counter examples. I don't think it matters if the chloroplasts are maintained indefinitely (in <em>Elysia<\/em> they aren't and several peer-reviewed publications still call them photosynthetic), and I don't think it's that difficult to even put in all the genetic circuitry to maintain them if you really wanted to.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you had asked whether a metazoan can be made photosynthetic, even if I hadn't heard of <em>Elysia<\/em>, I would say yes. But since you specify a mouse, the answer is no. Even if you had a green mouse with chloroplasts in its cells, it would gain very little nourishment from photosynthesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cells cannot photosynthesize if they get no light. So, presumably, you would have thought to at least shave your mouse, because obviously the fur would block most light.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even so, you must get rid of all the melanin pigment in the cell, because that will absorb light and waste its energy. But even if you used albino mice, the several layers of dead skin cells will still prevent light from reaching the living, photosynthetic cells. What's worse is that by introducing chloroplasts, you have counteracted the solution to the melanin problem - now all the dead cells are also full of very opaque <em>green<\/em> pigment, so 99% of the light is being absorbed by chloroplasts in dead cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only way to solve this problem is to constantly scrub the skin of the mouse raw. This would be very painful and dangerous for the mouse, but let's assume you somehow managed to do it. You're still stuck. Even if the skin cells produce a lot of glucose, that glucose will not be effectively transported. Firstly, it will be the outermost cells that have the most concentrated glucose, but the inner cells are the ones in close proximity of blood vessels. Even if you somehow solved the transport issue, the veins coming from the skin do not go into the liver, they go to the heart. You will now end up with diabetes-like problems in many organs because of absurdly high blood glucose concentrations. Let's say you even solved this problem by doing surgery to dramatically rework the \"plumbing\" of your mouse, and adding glucose transporters to skin cells. Now you have to deal with the most fundamental problem of them all: It's probably not a coincidence that photosynthesis did not evolve in animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photosynthesis works for plants because they have much lower energy needs. Even so, they must go to great lengths to maximize their surface area with many leaves. A mouse has evolved to <em>minimize<\/em> its surface area, because mice would much rather not waste calories on heating up the atmosphere. But even if you yet further modified your mouse by somehow \"adding\" huge blankets of skin that must be spread out under a sunlamp, I still doubt that unless we are talking about several square yards of skin for each mouse, that the energy needs of a mouse can be serviced adequately by photosynthesis. As a very rough estimate, imagine you wanted a field of grass big enough that it grows back faster than a mouse can eat it (assuming the mouse can subsist entirely on eating this \"grass\"). How much area would it have? Certainly much more than the surface area of a mouse.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I had to imagine a mammal that relies on photosynthesis, it would probably have a specialized organ just for this. For instance, it could be something like a bat, with thin membranous \"wings\" of great area, used not for flying but for collecting light. Or it could have a membranous \"sail\", attached to perhaps a bony \"mast\" - the mast can be raised by muscles to stretch out the sail, and the sail can be folded and stuffed into a body cavity which the mast then plugs when the sail is not in use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Either way, this animal would have a very large membrane, rich in photosynthetic cells and blood vessels. It would be a very leisurely animal, like a sloth, using little energy, and spend most of the day basking in the sun with the sail extended, making sugar. At night, it would perhaps scavenge for dead insects (to get nitrogen) or somehow trap insects with little effort.<\/p>\n\n<p>This animal would probably live very close to the equator, somewhere very warm. Perhaps it is a desert animal (which would explain the need for such a convoluted means of sustenance) or some sort of sea creature which surfaces during the day.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fragile sail (so it would need to have a way of rapidly stopping blood flow) would have veins going to the liver, and there would have to be some very involved immune system adaptations to deal with the pathogen burden of having such an exposed tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, I cannot possibly imagine any lineage of mammal that such a bizarre animal could have diverged from; but if god set out to create a photosynthetic animal that survives in the wild, it would probably look somewhat like this (and absolutely not like a mouse).<\/p>\n","answer_id":17760,"question_id":17676,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17676/a-photosynthesizing-mouse","last_activity_date":1401423756,"creation_date":1401148371,"answer_count":2,"title":"A photosynthesizing mouse?","body":"<p>N.

If they had to, it probably is true that life could not evolve, but the general assumption is that there is a path to do so.  Let me try to be convincing of this.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Dawkin's <a href=\"http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/642589-first-life-the-search-for-the-first-replicator\">theory of the replicator<\/a> is axiomatic and not entirely helpful at this point, but it does have a lot to say.  Once you have self replicating systems, the rest of biology and evolution and selection does seem reasonable, even with the emergence of complicated structures like the <a href=\"http://musingsofscience.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/the-evolutionary-massif-and-the-eyes-pinnacle-part-1/\">eye<\/a>, the <a href=\"http://www.detectingdesign.com/flagellum.html\">flageller motor<\/a> and other seemingly unplausibly multi component systems seem to magically come together and do something new in the course of evolution.  Dawkins wrote a book on this topic \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_Mount_Improbable\">Climbing Mount Improbable<\/a>\" on this topic which tries to answer this question for several cases.  <\/p>\n\n<p>To outline why biological systems can and do seem to leap to new abilities, organs and unprecedented assemblies. In fact the do not, but there are so many possible trials (quintillions? ) over the trillions of years, that eventually some adaptive path to these features, which has usually been found when we go looking for it.  As such there is no clear reason why new cases of this argument need to carry extra weight.   The argument of statistically improbable combinations has been tried and remains unconvincing with respect to evolution several times.  <\/p>\n\n<p>After this, I think it would be fair to say that the origins of life, although coming clear still has many details to be resolved, but progress is being made. <a href=\"http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Paleobiology/Precambrian-Fossils.htm\">Precambrian evidence of primitive life<\/a> was very different as seen in fossil records.  We can see that at one time there were only bacteria and single celled organisms.  There is evidence that at one time there appears to be only simple very large single celled organisms that lay in shallow water and soaked up the sunlight, growing and growing.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We can see that going back about 1.2-2 billion years, life shows a pretty clear progression where selection and adaptation creates complexity in living things and transitions life from exclusively chemotrophs (metabolizing Sulfur from geological processes) to anoxic (no oxygen environment) photosynthesis, and then oxygen breathing organisms.   <\/p>\n\n<p>In the precellular world, the RNA World hypothesis describes how all that life needed was one sort of molecule - RNA.  That is chemically a very simple replicator.  Evidence is pretty strong that RNA world was possible.  Many chemists are interested in proving that RNA can be created more or less spontaneously from early earth chemical environments and recent experiments show that spontaneous <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090513/full/news.2009.471.html\">soups containing RNA are a reasonable picture of earth at one point<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>All this being said its probably true that exactly what happened and how it happened will never be 100% known and the argument can be made that something unnatural happened at some point. But I hope you can also see that while the argument may still hold some water, the need for any magical interventions in the action of life is retreating to a point of origin - the beginning of time.  Scientific inquiry is very much focused on filling the picture of the origins of life on earth though and given the success of finding probable paths through to the origins of life, the odds actually are in favor for making a statement of the physical mechanisms of life's origins. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just a couple of side notes.. (1) biologists are not stuck on <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/inheritance/\">everything being random<\/a>.  There is lots of work on mechanisms evolved to <a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/inheritance/\">adapt in non-random way<\/a>s.<br>\n(2) Darwin is not a sacred cow - just about any working biologist would love to show Darwin was wrong even in a little way.  The same is true for Einstein, Newton and the rest.  After a few years of trying though what one usually finds that its kinda difficult.  Its not a matter of who makes the argument or what it means, but it has to be convincing and that <a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/neutrinos-sub-light-speed/22876/\">turns out to be difficult<\/a>.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":6874,"question_id":6865,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1358699259},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef6c1e9a540c28587fe777f9bcf907af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1231/mcm","reputation":7783,"display_name":"MCM"},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1358795910,"creation_date":1358699210,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>I saw this refutation online of Darwin's Random Evolution Theory and cannot see any holes with the logic.

I do not mean that the reader is dumb, merely that the author's target audience is probably ill-informed about the details of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and similar fields. The author relies on being long and convoluted, appealing to faulty logic, and a whole slew of fallacies that might be missed if the reader hadn't already encountered them in the context of Evolution.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As for the theory of evolution, which says that living things evolved progressively from mud...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, as 5th has already said, this is a bad start. The Theory of Evolution (via Natural Selection if we want to get the full name out there) says nothing about the <strong>beginnings<\/strong> of life. That would be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\">Abiogenesis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Theory of Evolution merely dictates that subsequent generations adapt to their environment, and that those who have adapted best will pass their inheritable traits to the next generation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1. The first organism must have a system of producing and/or sourcing\n  energy along with subsystems of distribution and management of that\n  energy which interact and work together, otherwise it cannot power\n  critical tasks such as reproduction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn't a difficult task. Currently the most abundant source of energy on the planet is the Sun. It has been shining for billions of years before the Earth was formed, and will be shining for billions of years after you've read this paragraph.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we exclude sunlight for the LCA (Last Common Ancestor) of all life, then we're mostly talking about geothermal energy or chemical reactions. Ultimately, though, extant organisms store energy in chemical bonds. The primary \"Energy Carrier\" of the cell is ATP - Adenosine Tri-Phosphate, and it's the third of the three Phosphates that is often \"harvested\" for its energy - leaving ADP as a product of metabolic reactions.<\/p>\n\n<p>That a system of sourcing and managing energy distributions could arise from even simple situations is not so far fetched. Consider the Earth's atmosphere and weather patterns; initially they appear extremely complex and result in myriads of environments that even modern science cannot accurately predict more than a few days ahead.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the entire system is driven by the interaction of the planet's geography, the gases composing the atmosphere, and the Sun as it heats the system. Regulation is taken care of by Physics - hot air rises, cold air sinks, geographical location determines exposure to the energy source, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power is not an issue. Basic regulation is not an issue. Once the basics are down, more complex forms can Evolve.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2. It must have a system of reproduction which necessitates pre-existing subsystems of information storage (DNA), information copying, and information reading/processing which interact with each other and work together. This reproductive system is dependent on a power source, so it must be coordinated with the power system. The reproductive system must also copy/rebuild all critical infrastructure such as the power system and the reproduction system along with the \"circuitry\" and feedback mechanisms between them, otherwise the child organism will be dead..<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you're willing to accept that chemical reactions between amino acids and similar molecules can occur on primitive Earth, then the jump to this question isn't that hard.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, you should know that DNA almost certainly wasn't the initial genetic storage form. A commonly accepted and incredibly intriguing theory is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis\">RNA World Hypothesis<\/a>. RNA can <em>also<\/em> store genetic information - albeit at a less accurate rate for a shorter amount of time. More importantly, RNA has also been observed <em>folding into itself to create proteins and catalysts<\/em>. It's sort of a jack-of-all-trades, and since it's basic constituents have been discovered amongst the vacuum of spaces, all the pieces were here on Earth 4 B.Y.A. to make some of the first steps towards organic life. All that had to happen is that the right molecules had to come together, then physics takes over and you have some astonishing reactions. Given the right conditions and a few hundred million years, who's to say it isn't possible?<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3. It must have a growth system, otherwise the organism will reduce itself every time it reproduces and vanish after a few generations. This growth system necessitates subsystems of ingestion of materials from the outside world, processing of those materials, distribution, and absorption of those materials to the proper place, building the right thing at the right place and in the right amount. It must also have an expulsion system for waste materials.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Let me introduce you to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle\">Micelle:<\/a> A naturally occurring structure that looks an awful lot like today's cell membranes. It doesn't require exotic materials, it doesn't require fancy catalysts; it requires amphipathic molecules and that's about it. <\/p>\n\n<p>While complex organisms do require subsystems and various ways to ingest food to harness nutrition, for the most basic forms of life \"Digestion\" is little more than taking in outside material into the cell and then putting what's left back outside.<\/p>\n\n<p>To that end, Micelles merge on their own when distance allows. The mechanism is powered by the entropy of the water molecules surrounding the micelle's structure and doesn't require any sort of metabolism or organic control to occur. In addition, hydrophobic molecules can slip through unhindered fairly easily (depending on size), and many of amino acids used to make proteins and micronutrients our current bodies require are hydrophobic. <\/p>\n\n<p>So it's entirely possible to have a basic membrane that can \"eat\" other things without being strictly <em>alive<\/em>. Everything after that is just added complexity that was retained due to improved functionality. It's important to remind yourself that we're talking of a span of <strong>hundreds of millions of years<\/strong>. Almost <em>nothing<\/em> currently living on the planet has gone more than a few hundred thousand or few million years without drastically changing how it looks. A hundred million years ago humans were little more than rats or furry lizards. Imagine what could happen with 5x that span!<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4. All the \"circuitry\", signaling, and feedback infrastructure which allows the different systems and subsystems to coordinate together and work together must be in place before the organism can \"come alive\"...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This very, very much depends on your definition of <strong>alive<\/strong> - which is still difficult to define for Biologists to this day. <\/p>\n\n<p>Are viruses <em>alive<\/em>? They certainly do not retain any reproductive ability of their own and must hijack the operations of a living cell to create the next generation - but they still have inheritable genetic material, they still create structures and adapt to their environment, and still - in an odd way - consume resources to reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>What's the difference between the spread of iron oxide (rust) -- which, you could argue, requires an interaction of existing elements to perpetuate and has built-in feedback (it is inhibited when there is a <em>lack<\/em> of a substance - a completely viable and well-known trope of feedback mechanisms) -- and the spread of a fungus, which you could describe just as simply?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Defining \"Life\" by what exists today is a <em>mistake<\/em><\/strong> often made by those who dispute the Theory of Evolution. Only the most basic assumptions and connections can be made between life as-it-exists and life-as-it-started. The planet is different, the air is different, <em>the Moon is significantly further away<\/em>, and countless other things have occurred.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, we have definitely observed complex interactions of molecules and systems <em>in situ<\/em> within conditions similar to those of early Earth. One of the most famous is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment\">Miller-Urey<\/a> experiment.

One of which is the mutation-selection-drift balance. In short: Because mutations always occur, there is continually an input of deleterious mutations in populations genome resulting in some fitness decay (called mutation load). While mutations create this polymorphism, processes of selection and genetic drift cause a decrease in polymorphism. At equilibrium there is a balance between mutations, selection and drift called the mutation-selection-drift balance. You may also want to consider various population structure related concepts such as migration between patches. Haldane first explored this mutation load theoretically and estimated that the fitness of an existing individual in a population of perfect (deleteterious-mutations-free) individual is about 80% lower, which is huge! Such mechanism can explain various disease found in a population.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Age-specific intensity of selection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Also, for the question of disease appearing late in life (which is often the case of eyesight related disease), it is important to realize that those genes which are expressed late in life undergoes a lower selection resulting in a higher mutation-selection-drift balance. See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17077/why-does-evolution-not-make-our-life-longer/\">this post<\/a> for more info.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Impact of Medicine and social helping on the intensity of selection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As pointed out by @potterbond007 modern medicine allows to diminish the deleterious effect of some mutations. For example, one that has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot\" rel=\"nofollow\">clubfoot<\/a> may be operated and is likely to survive and reproduce and therefore propagating its deleterious alleles. This would be different in some past. Therefore, medicine diminish the selection pressure on deleterious alleles. However, modern medicine probably has a very low effect on our genomes because it is so modern. 100 years ago we could not operate clubfoot and 500 years ago (almost) nobody had glasses to correct for eyesight deficiency. We may go a bit further in the past and also consider that social interactions such as helping weak individuals in a tribe may also have decreases the selection pressure against deleterious alleles (more info in @theBIOguy 's answer). Of course, if selection is diminished the mutation-selcetion-drift balance is increased and deleterious alleles are more common and mutation load is greater.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further investigations will be needed in Epidemiology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming that eyesights disease are particularly common and deleterious, we should have a closer look to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology\" rel=\"nofollow\">epidemiology<\/a> of the diseases of interests. If it seems to you that eyesight-related diseases are more common and more important in terms of their effects on fitness than diseases on other traits then, you may want to seek into some physiological and developmental explanations that may tell you why eyes are so likely to be impacted by genetic and/or environmental factors. I personally have absolutely no knowledge about the epidemiology and developmental mechanisms of any eyesight disease! Also considerations of the impact of modern environment should be considered such as the impact of TV and computer screens on our eyes (more info in @biogirl 's answer)<\/p>\n","answer_id":17686,"question_id":17678,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1401210125},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1401196519,"creation_date":1401196519,"body":"<p>Remi.b and Potterbond007 have put forward excellent answers.

This division of labor deemphasized the importance of vision. Individuals with \"poor\" eyesight could easily maintain a high fitness (reproductive success) in this social structure. Second, humans have long term parental care (both within and among families - again a function of social living).

The immune system becomes more and more compromised until the CD4+ cell count drops to a level where the patient is diagnosed with AIDS. At this point the immune system is compromised and the chance of a secondary infection by a different organism increases which the patient can no longer fight off.

The formed ADP can be rephosphorylated to ATP by the enzym creatine kinase, which also requires creatinephosphate (the phosphate attached to the creatine provides the phosphate group for ADP to form ATP). Additionally, ATP can be formed out of 2 ADP molecules by adenylate kinase. The phosphagen system is largely driven by the law of mass action, i.e. the direction of the enzymatic reaction is controlled by the concentration of the products and substrates. In other words; when ATP is low, and ADP is high, the generation of ATP is favored and vice versa. The energy from the phosphagen system is depleted rather quickly tho.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second system, glycolysis, simply refers to the breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) to resynthesize ATP from the energy stored in those carbohydrates. Your muscles contain a buffer of glycogen, approx. 300~ gr for the average Joe (give or take). The glycogen can be broken down to glucose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis. The glucose-6-phosphate is broken down to 2 pyruvate and yields 3 ATP netto (2 when derived from glucose, rather than glycogen, due to a first enzymatic step which requires 1 ATP). The enzymatic steps of glycolysis are controlled by ATP, AMP, ADP and other factors, factually integrating the energy status of the muscle (primarly through allosteric regulation of enzymes, especially phosphofructokinase). <\/p>\n\n<p>The third system, the oxidative system, refers to the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, requiring oxygen to 'burn' them (citric acid cycle).

This would mean that the entire current population is descending from just a few individuals. Your thought experiment is assuming that the \"pyramid\" of your ancentors is expanding all the time, while the bottleneck event will essentially result in the opposite situation with an inversion of the pyramid, such as:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Your assumption:            Bottleneck:  \n\n xx xx xx xx                     x\n   xx xx                        x x\n    x x                        xx xx     \n     x                      xx xx xx xx\n           (present time)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The reason why the number of ancestors is smaller in the bottleneck event is naturally that the population is inbred (all individuals are related). In contrast, your thought experiment is assuming that all individuals forming the pyramid of your ancestors have completely unrelated ancestry. This is equivalent to assuming that the subpyramids for all ancestors never overlap.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your assumption is unreasonable since human generations are overlapping, the fecundity distribution of individuals is skewed, inbreeding is common and reproduction between more distantly related individuals will happen by pure chance. We also know that humans have historically gone through several population bottlenecks, see e.g. <a href=\"http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/2.full\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Hawks et al. 2000. Population Bottlenecks and Pleistocene Human Evolution. Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution 17(1): 2-22\">Hawks et al.

A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History. Am. J. Hum. Genet 79: 230\u2013237\">Lui et al. (2006)<\/a> for an overview. An realistic model of your ancestry is more likely to be (highly idealized and compacted):<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>       x\n      x x\n     xx xx\n  xx xx xx xx\n  xx xx xx xx\n     xx xx\n      x x\n       x\n     (you)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The issue we are discussing here is actually known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse\" rel=\"nofollow\">pedigree collapse<\/a>, where you will eventually find overlap between your ancestors, which will mean that the pedigree collapses instead of growing exponentially. <\/p>\n\n<p>Beside historical bottlenecks, there are also modern examples of extreme human inbreeding. Even if this is not directly related to your thought experiment, you might for instance want to look the pedigree of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Habsburg royal family<\/a>. Here is the genealogy of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles II<\/a> - remember, narrow loops in pedigrees are seldom a good idea:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/C0pK3.jpg\" alt=\"genealogy of Charles II\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here you can for instance see that Charles' father is also the uncle of his own wife. You can also see that only 5 persons enter in the family tree from the outside through marriages, which means that Charles only had 7 completely independent ancestors (ignoring relationships further back, outside of this tree). Going back 3 generations (sort of - hard to count with overlap), it is also apparent that Charles had a total of 8 ancestors instead of the 14 expected under your model. Another modern example of extreme human inbreeding is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints#Birth_defects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints<\/a>, where marriages between close relatives have been common along with <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/14/us-usa-mormons-genes-idUSN0727298120070614\" rel=\"nofollow\">high levels of rare birth defects<\/a>.

For the latter kind, many \"stages\" of \"evolution\" must be completed by \"the cancer\" (forgive the excessive quotes, but the terminology is a bit nuanced here). For a better idea of the nature of cancer, you could start by reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Hallmarks of Cancer<\/em><\/a> (and reading about it).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which of the following is always present in the cell cycle?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are eukaryotic cells like yeast which can be cultured in a medium containing only nutrients. Because these are unicellular organisms, there's no reason to expect that they have any growth factors or hormones or extrinsic signal like that (there's a caveat that often even unicellular organism can signal each other, but I believe there are also many that don't). All eukaryotic cells that divide have a cell cycle, so these cells also have it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, hormones and growth factors cannot be required for the cell cycle. Cyclins and Cdks are a fundamental part of virtually any cell cycle ever seen by science, so you could say they are necessary (though I think it is conceivable that an organism could exist which progresses its cell cycle using proteins completely divergent from known cyclins and Cdks, but then again).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which of the following is essential in cancer growth and division? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Without DNA replication, you obviously cannot make more cells, so that is necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are cancer kinds which are dependent on growth factors (perhaps they make their own growth factor) but there are also cancer which simply jam the receptor active, so that they can grow even without the factor. This is discussed in <em>The Hallmarks of Cancer<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Signalling molecules (assuming that extracellular signaling is meant, because if you start taking away signalling molecules <em>inside the cell<\/em> like IP3, obviously you can break the cell to the point it won't divide) is just a superset of growth factors; same arguments apply because growth factors <em>are<\/em> the most potent \"signalling molecules\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Control mechanism is also \"obviously unnecessary\" and \"obviously necessary\". Cancer is uncontrolled division, so if there was control, the cancer wouldn't be there in the first place, duh. But obviously cancer cells also control their own division to some extent - they still have a coherent cell cycle and so on.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the key to understanding cancer is being cognizant of \"perspectives\".<\/p>\n\n<p>\"The body\" (actually the wild-type genome) has a certain plan in mind for what each cell should do, and to that end, it has programmed the cells here to divide so many times in so and so fashion and the cells there to not divide unless this event happens and so forth. If those cells are mutated, and that programming is disrupted, they may divide in ways the body \"does not want\" (ie. they create tissue which has not been evolutionary selected for over previous generations), so from the body's point of view the cancer is indeed out of control.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the cancer is almost like its own separate organism - for one, it certainly has a different DNA than you, as it has mutated. It undergoes Darwinian evolution and becomes gradually more adept at surviving and spreading inside your body. So from the cancer's point of view, the cancer cells are indeed quite well-controlled, with the goal of that control being to divide as much as possible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17651,"question_id":17627,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17627/cancer-growth-and-cell-division","last_activity_date":1401060722,"creation_date":1400991069,"answer_count":2,"title":"Cancer growth and cell division","body":"<p>I am confused about the prerequisites for cell division and cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which of the following is necessary for the cell cycle to progress?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hormones<\/li>\n<li>Growth factor  <\/li>\n<li>Cyclins  <\/li>\n<li>Cyclin dependent kinases <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Which of the following is essential for cancer proliferation?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Growth factors<\/li>\n<li>Signalling molecules<\/li>\n<li>DNA replication <\/li>\n<li>A control mechanism<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>How do the cell cycle and cancer relate to each other?<\/p>\n","question_id":17627,"tags":["human-biology","cell-biology","cancer","cell"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"off-topic","is_answered":true,"view_count":189,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1401060722},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19a3374fef34dc09ea6e80a5b05c2d8f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3141,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3141/laggingreflex","reputation":446,"display_name":"laggingreflex","accept_rate":93},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/185aae2d842026d2eefa7528b00b394b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6835,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6835/alexis-wilke","reputation":183,"display_name":"Alexis Wilke"},"score":1,"post_id":17642,"edited":false,"creation_date":1401080879,"comment_id":24180,"body":"Just a guess, but I would say that the process of the seed growing into a plant started.

I was embarrassed to have to report such an unsophisticated procedure in our publication. But then I realized that\n  he was able to complete this step in a few hours and saw no point in\n  wasting precious time and material in learning how to do the heating in a large beaker or flask. Later, when another of my students\n  puriﬁed an enzyme with a heating step and had to scale up his\n  procedure 2,000-fold from 3 milliliters to 6 liters, I advised the\n  Okazaki maneuver: he added 3 milliliters to each of 200 test tubes to\n  carry out the heating and centrifugation step, repeating the procedure nine times.
