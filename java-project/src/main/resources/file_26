They are both biological and sociological. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Easier for women<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>The female cycle is more complicated<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The female cycle leading to ovulation is regulated by several hormones that interact. As such, it is easier to disturb. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The system is so sensitive that even the slightest alteration in any of these factors can disrupt its fluidity and lead to anovulation<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(Anovulation = a cycle where no ovulation occurs) Source: <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/253190-overview#a5\">Anovulation: Background, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Even in young women, this occurs naturally. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Estimates of chronic anovulation rates range from 6-15% of women during the reproductive years<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Female bodies l already have a \"built-in mechanism for contraception<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As ovulation needs to be suppressed during pregnancy, there is already a mechanism in place by which this can happen. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Women are more affected by pregnancy<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Since women are more affected by pregnancy and childbirth, the risk they feel they have when they don't use contraception or use it incorrectly is larger. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Contraceptives for women have more than one use<\/em><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More than half of pill users, 58%, rely on the method at least in part for purposes other than pregnancy prevention. Thirty-one percent use it for cramps or menstrual pain, 28% for menstrual regulation, 14% for acne, 4% for endometriosis, and 11% for other unspecified reasons. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Beyond-Birth-Control.pdf\">Beyond Birth Control: The Overlooked Benefits of Oral Contraceptive Pills<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Harder in men<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>It only takes one<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>While the saying \"it only takes one sperm\"  is probably an exaggeration, it carries a certain truth - you really need to shut down the production of sperm or the risk of a pregnancy is too high. Both the pill and the various IUD options have set a high bar for what's considered an acceptable risk. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Side effects and effectiveness<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>While hormonal contraception for women already has a multitude of side effects, often unrelated to the reproductive system, this is certainly not easier in men. The most prohibiting side effect encountered so far is impotence - not much use in taking birth control to have sex without risk of pregnancy when doing so leads to no sex at all. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Progestins have been used in multiple small studies of men for suppression of spermatogenesis and testosterone production. Progestins used alone result in significant side effects such as loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v22/n3/full/ijir20102a.html\">Update on Male Hormonal Contraception: Is the Vasectomy in Jeopardy?<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(Decreased libido is also a side effect in female hormonal contraception, though. The reasons why it's seen as more acceptable there are probably sociological) <\/p>\n\n<p>That review is a good overview on what has been tried until 2010. Many solutions failed because of side effects or because they didn't work well enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>On testosterone:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of note, this international study revealed that 91% of Asian and 60% of Caucasian patients became azoospermic, suggesting an ethnic difference in endocrine response<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Testosterone proved to be rather good in other doses and combinations, but is not that easy to handle because it requires injections and can't be taken orally. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Testosterone alone has side effects, including acne and oily skin, mood changes, increased hemoglobin and hematocrit, weight gain, decrease in testicular volume, sleep apnea, gynecomastia and possible effects on cholesterol. There are no long-term data with testosterone use and normal men regarding prostate symptoms, growth or cancer. In an era of fear of using medications on relatively healthy individuals, acceptability of routine use may be a major concern, given recent data on medical treatment of menopause with estrogen/progestin therapy. In addition, anabolic steroids are a controlled substance and regulation of this industry is very strict at this time. Abuse of these drugs could easily become prevalent with its widespread use and availability for contraception.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>On cryproterone acetate:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Doses ranging from 25 to 100\u2009mg per day have suppressed spermatogenesis, but side effects have precluded subsequent studies. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And so on... <\/p>\n\n<p><em>The market factor<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>A side effect of the contraceptive options for women being so well-accepted, women often feeling responsible for contraception and also using hormonal contraception anyway, for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, is that the market for male contraception is not that easy and pharmaceutical companies have been pulling away from it. Especially in light of the research difficulties. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although Bayer, Wyeth and Organon were once active in research and development of a male method, all three discontinued their programs between 2005 and 2008 although the industry continues to actively pursue programs for hormonal contraception and hormonal-replacement therapy for women. In withdrawing support, company representatives cited corporate changes in direction and the perception that safety standards demanded by regulatory bodies would require such extensive evidence as to make further research financially infeasible<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775627_3\">Current challenges in male contraceptive research<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that there really is no market. As you mentioned in the comments, at least in questionnaires, many men say they would use male hormonal contraception and many women say they would like their partners to use it. See, for example, <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775627_7\">Market size for male contraception<\/a> (plus the following pages of that paper) <\/p>\n\n<p>But you asked about the challenges ;-)<\/p>\n\n<p>I think it's also interesting to note that the search for hormonal contraception started for both men and women.

You might not find many sources that directly cover this question because it is hard to test. If speciation did happen in two separate locations and the resulting species were so similar that they could breed with one another and not the original species, how would we be able to tell if the species originated in separate locations and that the new species didn't just travel to the new location? Below I'll try and explain why it's safe to assume they probably didn't have different locations for speciation.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Thought Experiment<\/h1>\n\n<p>Here is what happened in hypothetical land. Species X exists in <em>happy land<\/em>. Individuals of X then move to <em>water land<\/em>. Some more individuals from X move from <em>happy land<\/em> to <em>H2O land<\/em> (very similar to <em>water land<\/em>). Species X undergoes speciation in <em>water land<\/em> to species Y and speciation of X also occurs in <em>H2O land<\/em> to species Z. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can Z and Y be the same species with different origins where the niche conditions are the same?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, the longer after geographical isolation the more mutations occur and the less likely it is that the new species will be able to breed successfully with similar species. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although the two environments may seem identical, ecology is notoriously complex and chaotic, and so in reality as far as ecology is concerned, they are very different environments. Even the <strong><em>slightest difference between niches will naturally select different traits<\/em><\/strong> that could make Z and Y sexually incompatible. <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when dealing with the geographical origin, you must assume that there was geographical isolation between the two speciation event locations. Since there is typically no contact between Z and Y species, there is <strong><em>no selective pressure to remain genetically compatible<\/em><\/strong> and given enough time, they will become unable to breed.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Humans<\/h1>\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090828/full/news.2009.870.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">contentious claim<\/a> that ancient humans bred with chimpanzees after both speciation events from our common ancestor to humans and chimpanzees. Broadly I think this has now been dismissed. However it is reasonably well accepted that in a more recent \"Tolkien-esque\" world <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26435-thoroughly-modern-humans-interbred-with-neanderthals.html#.VWRmRS_v32Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">humans bred with Neanderthals<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But ultimately I don't think there is a single example <em>(I am thoroughly open to being proven wrong!)<\/em> in the natural world of two similar geographical isolation events driving exactly the same species to evolve and both versions of the new species are more genetically similar to one another than they are to the origin species.

To\n  maintain a constant body temperature despite rapid heat loss across a\n  body surface, a small animal must oxidize food at a high rate. Because\n  the relative amount of food consumed and the pace of digestion,\n  respiration, and so on must rise with decreasing body size, there is a\n  lower limit on the size of endotherms. The smallest mammals are\n  shrews, which weigh only about 4 grams. They must eat nearly their own\n  body weight of food every day, and starve to death is just a few hours\n  if deprived of food.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is shows that smaller animals, like mice have a much faster metabolic rate than that of larger animals like humans or elephants.<\/p>\n\n<p>When talking of within the cell, the mitochondrial content of a muscle cell of a mouse would be increased to produce more energy from one feeding than that of a human. This is because cells themselves increase the number of mitochondria based on the requirement of the body, thus a muscle cell of a human has more mitochondria than a neuron, since muscle cells have to utilize much more ATP to function. This phenomenon, known as <em>mitochondrial biogenesis<\/em> would be observed in mice vs human cells.\nIn mice, having more mitochondria would be an evolutionary advantage, as only those producing the optimal amount of energy would be able to survive the loss of energy to the surroundings and the process of natural selection would leave mice with relatively larger numbers of mitochondria in their cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>(For more info)<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111900005825\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111900005825<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":40338,"question_id":40281,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1446833765}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40281/why-do-mice-have-a-higher-metabolism","last_activity_date":1448991874,"creation_date":1446654747,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do mice have a higher metabolism?","body":"<p>Mice and other small animals have higher metabolic rate than humans. <\/p>\n\n<p>How does that happen on cellular level, if we look on one cell in the mouse body?<\/p>\n\n<p>What is it in this cell that will be different? <\/p>\n\n<p>How is that regulated inside mouse cell?<\/p>\n","question_id":40281,"tags":["biochemistry","physiology","metabolism","bioenergetics"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":224,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1448991874},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c33b366ce192e4cefbe9db22f2ad7be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":20386,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/20386/mrjayviper","reputation":98,"display_name":"mrjayviper"},"closed_date":1449027035,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":2,"post_id":41140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1448953338,"comment_id":69597,"body":"Nope, all modern humans are one species, even one subspecies (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human<\/a>).

It is also not dependent on the number of susceptible individuals, since it is defined as the number of secondary infections in a fully susceptible population, see e.g. this section in <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2680869?\" rel=\"nofollow\">Farrington et al (2001)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent in a given population is the average number of secondary infections which one typical infected individual would generate if the population were completely susceptible. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also consistent with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia description<\/a> (\"<em>...in an otherwise uninfected population<\/em>\"). $R_0$ is however dependent on the environment (dispersal routes, host-host interactions etc), which also why it is used to evaluate and compare the effect of control measures. Host-host interactions is also dependent on population density, so $R_0$ is indirectly influenced by host population density, and this is partially why estimated $R_0$ values for the same disease will differ between countries and populations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally and conceptually, $R_0$ is the same thing as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_reproduction_rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Net reproductive rate<\/a> (often also labelled $R_0$) in demography and population modelling, and it was originally borrowed from demography to epidemiology. As such, the net reproductive rate is often used in for instance pest control to evaluate the potential impact of pest species on agricultural crops, in direct analog to the <em>basic reproduction number<\/em> in epidemiology (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195427\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emiljanowicz et al, 2014<\/a> for a randomly picked, recent example). Most commonly, $R_0$ (both in population dynamics and epidemiology) is calculated from static demographic rates, but nothing prevents you from considering stochastic effects, density dependence or e.g. ways that demographic rates are functions of host density or population size. This could lead to formulations where $R_0$ is an explicit function of host population  density, but that is not the standard use of $R_0$.<\/p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems like you are asking for the <strong>effective reproduction number ($R(t)$)<\/strong>, which can be defined by: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>...the average number of secondary cases that result from an infectious case in a particular population (Box 1).

So basically, $R(t)$ is the average number of secondary cases per primary case at time $t$ (including the effects of immunity and/or control measures).

Most of these RNAs have been identified by sequencing and the sequencing experiment can only say which region of the genome a read maps to. It does not give any clue about how the RNA was produced. <\/p>\n\n<p>So any read mapping to intron of another gene has been classified as intronic RNA which IMO is not fully correct. Only reads that truly arise from the intronic region of the nascent transcript (via RNA processing) are to be considered as intronic RNAs, and not merely based on their genomic overlap. Any independent transcript that overlaps with the intronic region is to be considered an overlapping gene. However, ascertaining the mechanism may not be that simple. miRNAs and some snoRNAs are known to be produced from processing of the intronic region. <\/p>\n\n<p>A statement such as this (from the <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2Fgkq1080\" rel=\"nofollow\">cited article<\/a> [18] in your quotes):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Examining the data for intronic and exonic DNA from the human genome,\n  piRNAs are significantly more likely than expected ($\\chi^2_{1df}$\u2009=\u20091353.2;\n  P\u2009&lt;\u20092.2\u2009×\u200910<sup>−16<\/sup>) to reside in exons rather than introns, given that\n  introns are on average, approximately 15 times larger than exons.\n  <br>[\u2026]<br>\n  we found 36 sequences with a perfect match to regions overlapping the\n  exon\u2013exon splice junctions of mRNA, suggesting that these piRNA are\n  produced from mature mRNA.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>may be misleading because it just talks about genomic overlap.

Wikipedia, for example, seems rather vague:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While introns do not encode protein products, they are integral to gene expression regulation. Some introns themselves encode functional RNAs through further processing after splicing to generate noncoding RNA molecules.[18] Alternative splicing is widely used to generate multiple proteins from a single gene.

They vary in length from 5 or 6 amino acids up to 10-15. Some common ones include HA, FLAG, Myc, and V5.

They are also soluble, so they don't affect the tagged protein's structure much.

This can sometimes be solved by moving the tag from the amino- to the carboxy-terminus of the protein, if possible, but choosing a different tag is a common strategy. Another purely practical reason to use a different tag is that one protein in your experimental system may already be His tagged, so you need something different.

Well, here's what they essentially did: They tried to model evolution by implementing an algorithm. They had a population of 10000 individuals, represented by their genetic sequence, and had an algorithm do mutations of those sequences and modeled selection and reproduction to get the next generation. They did that for a long time. Why did that make me laugh? I did both my BSc and MSc theses in the field of Evolutionary Bioinformatics. Almost every student there implements something like that when they first start, to learn to write that kind of program. It's not exactly novel. They even cite several other studies doing this kind of analysis. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, their result is basically that human evolution from human-chimpanzee ancestors couldn't have happened because it would have taken way too long. Not only would the whole difference between these two species have taken too long, every single difference of more than two nucleotides would have taken too long to get fixed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since this goes against established science, this algorithm better be good... The paper is lengthy and much of it isn't all that interesting or related, in my opinion. But here's the big problems, in my opinion:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When natural selection successfully amplified the target string to the point of fixation (i.e., when the allele frequency reached 99\u2013100 %), <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Their target is for their target sequence to reach a frequency of at least 99 percent. That's unnecessarily high, and will of course take a long time, especially as they hold their population constant at 10000 individuals. They don't show a figure with how frequency changed over generations - I'd assume that 90 percent is reached a lot earlier than their threshold. <\/p>\n\n<p>Holding the population size constant is of course also not a realistic model for human evolution. It wasn't at 10000 individuals for millions of years. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>initialization : initialize every individual to the same random or user-specified string (e.g., AAAAA)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Humans didn't start with random sequences and then mutated them to make them do something useful, we started with useful genetic material that then changed. If you start at AAAAA, expect a target of TAGGC, don't confer <strong>any<\/strong> benefit to intermediate steps (as they did) at a mutation rate of something like 1 per ten million nucleotides per generation, of course you are going to wait a long time. Mutation rate in genomes also isn't uniform, it varies by region. From what I can see, this was neither taken into account nor discussed. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is also the problem of them only looking at single nucleotide mutation, not gene duplication, insertions, etc. that also make up a lot of the difference between humans and their ancestors. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then there's random \"mate-choosing\", which is a valid simplification to make if you are just looking at some mechanisms of evolution, but not valid if you are going to use your model to estimate time needed for speciation. <\/p>\n\n<p>They also only allow for one beneficial mutation to arise, then wait for it to be fixed, claiming that anything else would have just resulted in even longer times, without, as far as I can see, just implementing this and then testing that assumption. <\/p>\n\n<p>At some points, their paper is just going to going for some kind of dramatic effect:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>waiting time was 500 million years \u2013 which is still extremely prohibitive. This amount of time approximates the estimated time required for the evolution of worm-like creatures into people<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>500 million years ago, we had the first animals emerging on land and the first chordates. <em>Chordata<\/em> and the \"worm-like\" phyla had already diverged. <\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, in my opinion, they took a very simple model and drew sweeping conclusions from it. This kind of analysis is suited for looking at how evolution might result in speciation, what parameters might play a part, etc. but it is not suitable for estimating the time this takes. <\/p>\n\n<p>But these are just my first thoughts, I hope there'll a more thorough review of this on the internet somewhere soon. <\/p>\n","answer_id":41091,"question_id":40845,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1448791026}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40845/do-the-claims-in-this-paper-have-any-degree-of-validity","last_activity_date":1448804904,"creation_date":1448115099,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do the claims in this paper have any degree of validity?","body":"<p>The paper <a href=\"http://www.tbiomed.com/content/12/1/18\" rel=\"nofollow\">The waiting time problem in a model hominin population<\/a> talks about a problem of waiting time, etc. Is the methodology of this numerical simulation, and the conclusion right or is it wrong? <\/p>\n\n<p>(A quick search reveals that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Sanford\" rel=\"nofollow\">first author<\/a> is an intelligent design advocate and apparently believes or believed that the earth is less than 10,000 years old) <\/p>\n","question_id":40845,"tags":["evolution","theoretical-biology","human-evolution"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":159,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1448804904},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b5440c34109e218b55c29d2450159ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6136/21joanna12","reputation":659,"display_name":"21joanna12","accept_rate":46},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61088ee58466316218f96ae12fb35c9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13388,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13388/xelo747","reputation":463,"display_name":"xelo747"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61088ee58466316218f96ae12fb35c9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13388,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13388/xelo747","reputation":463,"display_name":"xelo747"},"score":0,"post_id":41076,"edited":false,"creation_date":1448730761,"comment_id":69495,"body":"I am having trouble finding non academic sources for my last claim, I shall come back and add more sources later once I find them."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b5440c34109e218b55c29d2450159ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6136/21joanna12","reputation":659,"display_name":"21joanna12","accept_rate":46},"score":1,"post_id":41076,"edited":false,"creation_date":1448738302,"comment_id":69510,"body":"thank you for your reply!

Most of your arguments, to the best of my knowledge are accurate. As to answer your questions, I'll provide a basic model of understanding. (Disclaimer:- <em>I'm sorry if the explanation seems overly-messed up and confusing<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<p>At any moment, the potential difference across the cell membrane has to be such that it makes all fluxes balanced. Let us assume there is a cell with nothing but potassium and non-diffusible negative porteins. Since potassium is the only ion that can have a flux, the only balanced position will be the one with zero flux, because any net ionic movement will cause a change of potential and hence will not be the balanced state. Zero flux will be reached when the concentration ratio of potassium outside and inside is such that the potential difference is equal to potassium's Nernst potential.  <\/p>\n\n<p>To complicate it, let's add sodium. Now the balanced state should have zero net flux. But this does not mean that the fluxes of both the ions is zero. They can be equal and opposite. Let us assume that the permeability of the membrane is equal for both. Then, the balanced potential would be equidistant from the Nernst potential of both the ions. This is because, permeability, in an abstract way, is a measure of the resistance. Flux is the potential difference (between the Nernst potential, where the flux would be zero, and the membrane potential) divided by the resistance (like a simple current), which would be equal only if this difference is same, which is, for a membrane potential midway between their Nernst potentials. Hence, the ion which has a higher permeability, will have a lesser resistance, and would hence require the potential difference to be low, so that the ratio of $PD$ and $R$ be equal to the other ion with a large $PD$ and a high $R$ (low permeability). <em>This $PD$, is not the membrane potential but the difference between this potential and the Nernst potential.<\/em>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for your first question<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...resting membrane potential is reached from the hyper polarised state....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is simple to understand because the opening of the potassium channels which caused the potential drop to $-90$ has now been reset and the permeabilities have been reset to the original resting values. Since the balanced state depends on the permebilities only, the balanced state of this is the RMP ($-60$), which the cell will achieve. Since $-90$ is unbalanced, the slightly unbalanced flux will cause a drift of the potential towards $-60$ and when it reaches it, the fluxes will match and hence won't deviate any further. The drift is because more of one ion is moving than the other, causing a net movement of charges across the membrane.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.... action of the sodium potassium pumps comes into this....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is easy to understand but tough to compute. Since the sodium potassium pump is unbalanced, (it puts out 3 sodiums and takes in 2 potassiums), it contributes a net flux always. Hence, the remaining channels, instead of having exactly equal sodium potassium fluxes, will have to have a slight potassium excess to offset the minor flux contributed by the pump. As a result, the effect can be computed in two ways.   <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We find the net flux contribution of the pump. Now we know by what amount should the potassium flux be greater than the sodium in the remainign channels which follow the PD/R formula and hence we can caluclate the PD such that the fluxes have a certain difference (equal to the flux contributed by the pump)  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>We perform experiments and directly find a net amount of potential \"correction\" which has to be added to the potential calculated by matching fluxes because of the pump, which will remarkably stay constant. This method is easier and the value of the correction can be obtained from literature online.  <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Hope this helped. Feel free to ask for clarifications.

In this reaction, the vagus nerve temporarilly slows down the heart rate, which causes a drop of blood pressure and hence fainting. You may be able to learn to prevent such a reaction. In hypovolemic shock, you lose a lot of blood (700 mL+), which again causes a drop of blood pressure. You can&#39;t convince yourself that you did not lose blood; still your psychological reaction to blood loss may aggravate or postpone shock a bit."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1444864575,"creation_date":1444863873,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it possible to stop yourself from going into shock?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are different types of shock: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, anaphylactic, septic, neurogenic, etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you prevent yourself from going into shock by virtue of pure willpower? No. You cannot override the body's reactions to decreased oxygen to the brain any more than you can will yourself out of the flu.<\/p>\n\n<p>The early signs of hypovolemia (blood loss), though, can be confused with those of vasovagal syncope (simple fainting). Both involve dizziness/lightheadedness, cool or clammy skin, and a decrease in blood pressure. However, with hypovolemia, your heart rate increases to compensate for the lowering of blood pressure (which eventually leads to shock), whereas with vasovagal syncope - which can occur with sudden fear - your heart rate drops, which is what causes your blood pressure to fall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Passing out due to blood loss depends in part on how rapid the blood loss is (the more rapid, the earlier on might pass out) and the volume lost. To lose enough blood to pass out, a healthy, normally hydrated person would need to lose about 2 liters of blood (or 20% of one's blood volume); maybe 1.5 liters if it happens quickly enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether it happens slowly or quickly, if enough blood is lost, shock will ensue.

But before talking about this specific code, it is important to talk about how the code is read. Please note that the below answer is a simplification of the reality.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanism by which the code is read<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To make things easier (reality is a little more complicated), DNA is \"formatted\" into RNA which is then \"formatted\" into proteins. When \"formatting\" occurs, we do not lose the previous format but we only copied the information into a new format. The formatting from DNA to RNA is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)\">transcription<\/a> and the formatting from RNA to proteins is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)\">translation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Proteins are the active units that affect the cell activities. The activity of a the proteins is a function of their sequence. As a consequence the language/code we must understand is the relationship between DNA and proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Numeral systems of DNA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>DNA as you said is written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_numeral_system\">quaternary (=numeric system at base 4)<\/a>. The four letters are called A,T,C and G which stands for Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine (<strong>4 nucleotides<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Numeral systems of proteins<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Proteins on the other hand are coded in a system at base 21 (<strong>21 amino acids<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Redundancy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Because $4^2=16&lt;21$, we need to use (at least) 3 letters in DNA to code for 1 amino acid. Because $4^3=64&gt;21$, we necessarily have several codes of 3 nucleotides that match to the same amino acid. We talk about <strong>redundancy<\/strong>. In computer science, a byte is a series of 8 bits. In biology, a codon is a series of 3 nucleotides.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Code<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Below is the code:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/GeneticCode.png\"><img src=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/GeneticCode.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>, where <code>Phe<\/code>, <code>Leu<\/code>, <code>Ser<\/code>, etc... are abbreviation for specific amino acids. <code>Phe<\/code> for example is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine\">phenylallanine<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the above table, most of the redundancy is caused by changes in the third letter of the codon. More information on why it is the case on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35778/evolution-of-the-redundancy-of-the-genetic-code\">this post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are 4 special codons.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>AUG<\/code>: Is the <em>start<\/em> codon. It is an indication of where translation should start.<\/li>\n<li><code>UAG<\/code>, <code>UAA<\/code> and <code>UGA<\/code> are <em>stop<\/em> codons. They are indication of where translation should stop.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Possible confusions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Central Dogma of Molecular Biology<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The unidirectional relationship between DNA, RNA and proteins has been called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology\">Central Dogma of Molecular Biology<\/a>. Of course there is no place for dogma in science and the term is very improperly used. Interestingly enough, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is partially wrong because this relationship between DNA, RNA and proteins is not necessarily unidirectional. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase\">reverse transcriptase<\/a> is an enzyme that reformat DNA from RNA.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Genetic code<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>If you google \"genetic code\", most hits will display the letter <code>U<\/code> instead of the letter <code>T<\/code>. The reason is that the code is often presented for the relationship between RNA and DNA and the only difference in the code between RNA and DNA is that <code>T<\/code> (Thymine) is replaced by <code>U<\/code> (Uracile).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>mRNA vs RNA<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Not all RNA are meant to be translated into proteins.

I very welcome editing to improve this answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The field of bioinformatics is a big field. Bioinformaticians need basic knowledge in<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>biology<\/li>\n<li>molecular genetics<\/li>\n<li>Population genetics<\/li>\n<li>programming<\/li>\n<li>statistics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You may find courses on statistics applied to bioinformatics <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Krijnen-IntroBioInfStatistics.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here (R-language)<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> (I haven't watched these sources).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How to start programming? - Python<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You seem to be mostly interested in is programming. I think that <strong>Python<\/strong> (or Julia) is a very good start to get in touch with programming. Programming might looks a bit scary when you don't really know what it is about but you can easily, in few days, acquire basic knowledge in this field and already solve some pretty neat problems. Many people actually have lots of fun learning how to program. And you'll probably be amazed by all the power this tool will offer to you. I personally really enjoyed learning programming in Python. I did it (I was mostly interested into object-oriented programming, you'll learn what it means) in a day or two with a very good source but unfortunately this source is not available in english. But there are tons of introductory documents, you'll have no difficulty to find a good one. I'd counsel you to directly <a href=\"http://python.org/download/\" rel=\"nofollow\">download Python<\/a> and to look at online courses on <a href=\"https://en.khanacademy.org/science/computer-science-subject/computer-science\" rel=\"nofollow\">khan academy<\/a> or <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-1498\" rel=\"nofollow\">EdX<\/a> (I haven't watch them).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Data analysis - R<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>While Python is a much more powerful programming language than <strong>R<\/strong>, I think that, as a biologist, it is very important that you know about R. R is a programming language which is slow (compare to Python, C, Java, \u2026) but it is very useful for statistical analysis and visual display of data. Also many people use R in bioinformatics (for phylogenetic analysis typically). I think that acquiring basic knowledge in R takes more time than in Python because we tend to use R because of its huge amount of already existing functions and therefore, we have to learn many of these functions before understanding that R can indeed be much more useful than Python for some tasks.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>File manipulation - Shell script<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shell script<\/strong> (BASH for example) is a very specific and very important language too. Very useful for manipulating and transferring files.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C<\/strong> is very fast and very much used as well. <strong>Perl<\/strong> is commonly used for genomic sequence analysis (although Perl is slowly loosing users to the advantage of Python).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Usefulness of programming<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You also ask about the usefulness of programming. Well it is used in pretty much all areas of biology. It is used for analyzing empirical data, computer simulations in population genetics, graph theory, annotating DNA sequences, \u2026 I guess that 98% of biologists have at least some basic knowledge in programming. The main point about programming is that it performs calculation much faster than anything you could ever realized with your calculator. Typically, in bioinformatics, analysis of DNA sequences often asks for very intense calculation and asks for big computation power. Processes such as constructing phylogenetic trees, determining goodness of fit of evolutionary models, annotating DNA, aligning DNA sequences, analyzing microarray and many other things are all sorts of tasks that require programming.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15294,"question_id":15292,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1448728044}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15292/basic-programming-and-bioinformatics","last_activity_date":1448728044,"creation_date":1393196723,"answer_count":1,"title":"basic programming and bioinformatics","body":"<p>As a molecular biology graduate student I have decided to learn some basic programming and bioinformatics since everybody says that it is crucial.

Intestinal epithelial cells are shed and replaced constantly and very rapidly, roughly every 5 days.  So that means about 50-70 cell generations per year.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Each time the cell replicates, it loses a little bit off the end of its telomeres.  How much does it lose?  <\/p>\n\n<p>We know that for lymphocytes, adults lose roughly <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534658/\" rel=\"nofollow\">30 base pairs of telomeres per year<\/a>.  Lymphocytes don't replicate as fast as the colonic mucosa, though.  The estimate for these rapidly-dividing cells is about <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">44 bp/year<\/a>. We can say 50 for a round number.  <\/p>\n\n<p>That doesn't tell us much unless we know what we're starting and stopping with.  Humans start life with about <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v52/n3/fig_tab/pr2002193t3.html#figure-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">10,000 bp of telomeres<\/a>.  At least in cultured cells, once telomeres reach <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482700948237\" rel=\"nofollow\">1000-2000 bp<\/a>, cells become senescent and stop, or greatly reduce, their growth rate. <\/p>\n\n<p>So we start at around 10,000, we can lose up to 9000, and we lose around 50 per year. That means that the intestinal epithelium, which have about the most rapidly-dividing cells in the body, are good for about 180 years of life, assuming that the loss remains constant.<\/p>\n\n<p>(I don't know if loss does remain constant in these cells, but in lymphocytes, the loss of telomeres accelerates in elderly people, from about <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">30 to about 60 bp/year<\/a> in people over 60. However, it's likely that reflects increased lymphocyte turnover in older people, not something intrinsic to the age per se.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So bottom line, we're good for it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>More generally, keep in mind that the popular media have seized on telomeres as a simple answer for everything related to aging.  Obviously, that's not reality.  Telomeres certainly reflect aging; in some cases, perhaps many cases, they may be one influence on aging; but in most cases, telomere shortening is probably only a minor aging factor, and many other causes are more important.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41067,"question_id":41059,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41059/hayflick-limit-and-hair-or-nails","last_activity_date":1448719003,"creation_date":1448699298,"answer_count":1,"title":"Hayflick limit and hair or nails","body":"<p>I am not a bio major but I have heard about Telomerese shortening in each cell division which leads aging and cellular death.

In amphibians and insect the oocyte, or egg, produced by the mother, has a polarity such that some macromolecules are enriched in different regions of the egg.

Evolution does not care about you <em>after<\/em> you have reproduced. As long as an individual reproduces, evolution is \"happy\". For example, you think falling asleep after sex is counterproductive on the evolutionary scale? What about Mantises where the female will sometimes eat the male during or immediately after copulation. Falling asleep seems like a pretty small thing compared to that (<a href=\"http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1801\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although the praying mantis is known for its cannibalistic mating process in actuality it only occurs 5-31% of the time. Especially in laboratory conditions of bright lights and confinement, the female is more likely to eat the male as means of survival. \"In nature, mating usually takes place under cover, so rather than leaning over the tank studying their every move, we left them alone and videotaped what happened. We were amazed at what we saw. Out of thirty matings, we didn't record one instance of cannibalism, and instead we saw an elaborate courtship display, with both sexes performing a ritual dance, stroking each other with their antennae before finally mating. It really was a lovely display\". (7) There is one species, however, the Mantis religiosa, in which it is necessary that the head be removed for the mating to take effect properly. (5) Sexual cannibalism occurs most often if the female is hungry. But eating the head does causes the body to ejaculate faster.

Because ATP or other energetic compounds are not directly involved in co-transport, it is referred to as secondary active transport. The electrochemical ion gradient is mainly established by the Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nAs commented upon by others, your question is not entirely clear and a good way to start is with defining the various terminologies and physiological mechanisms used in your question:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active transport<\/strong> needs an energy source such as ATP. For example, the Na<sup>+<\/sup>,K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase is an enzyme that pumps Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> ions against their concentration gradients into the cytosol (K<sup>+<\/sup>) or out of the cell (Na<sup>+<\/sup>). Note that both Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> are transported against their chemical gradients (and Na<sup>+<\/sup> also against its electrical gradient as the cell is negative). Therefore your statement that <code>[...] in the active process, substance x is transported against the gradient, and substance y down its electrochemical gradient<\/code> is untrue, and likely the cause of your confusion. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Passive transport<\/strong> is mediated by <strong>diffusion<\/strong>, which typically occurs through a concentration gradient. Only small, relatively hydrophobic molecules are able to diffuse across a phospholipid bilayer at significant rates. Examples are gases (such as O<sub>2<\/sub> and CO<sub>2<\/sub>) in the lungs, and small polar but uncharged molecules (such as H<sub>2<\/sub>O and ethanol) (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2040-1124.2012.00227.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooper, 2000)<\/a>.  <\/li>\n<li><strong>Facilitated diffusion<\/strong> is an example of <strong>passive diffusion<\/strong>, but aided by membrane-spanning channel proteins that span the lipid bilayer. Therefore the particles (molecules or ions) do not have to dissolve in the cell membrane's hydrophobic lipid bilayer, allowing hydrophylic and larger molecules (carbohydrates, ions) to be transported into the cell. No external source of energy is needed and  travel across the membrane in the direction determined by their concentration gradients and, in the case of charged molecules, by the electric potential across the membrane (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2040-1124.2012.00227.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooper, 2000)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Co-transport<\/strong> is <strong>active transport<\/strong>, where the <strong>energetically unfavorable transport<\/strong> of a particle <em>against<\/em> its electrochemical gradient is facilitated by the co-transport of a <strong>favorable one<\/strong> <em>down<\/em> its gradient. In other words, multiple particles are transported so as to neutralize the sum of the transport. For example, sodium-dependent glucose tranporters transport glucose into the cell against the concentration gradient (unfavorable) and Na<sup>+<\/sup> is transported along with it into the cell which is a favorable transport (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2040-1124.2012.00227.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haraki &amp; Inagaki, 2012<\/a>). This is an example of a <em>symporter<\/em>. An example of an <em>antiporter<\/em> is the Na<sup>+<\/sup>/Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> antiporter found in the heart to transport Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> out of the cell against a steep concentration gradient and electrical gradient, while 3 Na<sup>+<\/sup> is imported into the cell to balance the unfavorable Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> transport. Note that all these mentioned co-transporters and many others are dependent on the Na,K-ATPase that ultimately generates the Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> gradients by pumping Na<sup>+<\/sup> out of the cell and K<sup>+<\/sup> into the cell using ATP (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21687/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freeman, 2000<\/a>). This generated membrane potential works like a battery being charged, and co-transporters discharge it by using the energy stored by importing Na<sup>+<\/sup>.

In Western blotting, they are run as a \"loading control\" to show that very similar amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. This is absolutely essential in some experimental systems where it may not be possible to always collect the exact same number of cells for each sample, such as when working with primary cells, tissue samples, or systems where you may be altering protein synthesis, cell size/number, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">apoptosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many different loading controls to choose from, and some may be dictated by the cell/tissue type you are examining &mdash; for example, when working with stem cells, you may want to show that your experimental conditions didn't induce differentiation in the cells, so a pluripotency marker like Oct-4A or Sox2 may be chosen. In other cases, you may be examining fractionated lysates (a membrane preparation, just the nuclei, mitochondria, only the soluble fraction, etc.) and so may choose Na/K ATPase, Histone H3, COX IV, or GAPDH, respectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>The choice of loading control can also be influenced by the size(s) of the protein(s) you are analyzing, as investigators frequently either strip Western blots and reprobe them with the loading control, or run two different species and detect with different colored secondary antibodies when performing fluorescent Westerns. In either case, you want your loading control to be a different size than your original targets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, all of this is assuming that the researcher has already attempted to load equal amounts of total protein per lane by using any one of a variety of methods for quantitating protein concentration.

That, young man, is the difference between a spore and a cyst. <\/p>\n","answer_id":38929,"question_id":34889,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b96176b3cb025060df5d8317a08b1a5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":20309,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/20309/sugandha-mahajan","reputation":1,"display_name":"sugandha mahajan"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":41026,"edited":false,"creation_date":1448559938,"comment_id":69383,"body":"Welcome to Bio.
