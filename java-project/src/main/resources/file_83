Thus, the color (<em>R<\/em>=0, <em>G<\/em>=0, <em>B<\/em>=1), i.e. pure $\\color{#0000ff}{\\rm blue}$, has exactly the same <em>L<\/em> value (0.5) as the color (<em>R<\/em>=0, <em>G<\/em>=1, <em>B<\/em>=1), i.e. $\\color{#00ffff}{\\rm cyan}$, yet it's obvious at a glance that the latter color is visually much brighter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the HSL color space doesn't even <em>try<\/em> to match the perceptual lightness of the colors; rather, the definition of the <em>L<\/em> channel is chosen because it has the convenient feature that it maps black to <em>L<\/em>=0, white to <em>L<\/em>=1, and all the six maximally saturated pure RGB colors (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta), despite their wide perceptual lightness differences, to <em>L<\/em>=0.5.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A much better approximation to the perceived lightness of a color is the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_%28video%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">luma<\/a> <em>Y<\/em>', which is defined as a weighted average of the RGB channels.  The precise weights depend on the definition and the RGB color space used, but a common choice (from <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITU-R Rec. 709<\/a>) is: $$Y' = 0.2126\\, R + 0.7152\\, G + 0.0722\\, B$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The weighs are chosen to account for the different perceived lightness of the different RGB primary colors.  A striking feature is the that the green component alone accounts for over 70% of the luma, nearly ten times as much as the blue component.  Yet a visual comparison of $\\color{#0000ff}{\\rm 100\\%\\ blue}$ with $\\color{#00ff00}{\\rm 100\\%\\ green}$ does clearly confirm that this choice of weights is justified: the pure green appears <em>much<\/em> brighter than the blue, and almost as bright as the cyan (which is their sum) above.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, the definition of the luma still ignores the non-linearity of both the standard RGB color spaces (such as <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sRGB\" rel=\"nofollow\">sRGB<\/a>) and the human eye.  While these two effects partly cancel out each other, allowing luma to be used as a reasonable approximation of perceptual lightness, for truly accurate results they need to be accounted for.  This involves several steps:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Convert the RGB color into a linear color space.  For sRGB, the following <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB#The_reverse_transformation\" rel=\"nofollow\">formula<\/a> may be used: $R_L = f(R), G_L = f(G), B_L = f(B)$, where: $$f(C) = \\begin{cases}C / 12.92 &amp; \\text{if } 0 \\le C \\le 0.04045 \\\\ ((C + 0.055) / 1.055)^{2.4} &amp; \\text{if }  0.04045 &lt; C \\le 1 \\end{cases}$$ (Here, $R$, $G$ and $B$ are the sRGB component values, and $R_L$, $G_L$ and $B_L$ the linear ones, both scaled to the range from 0.0 to 1.0.)  Alternatively, a very close approximation to the formula above is given by simple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction\" rel=\"nofollow\">gamma-expansion<\/a> with $\\gamma = 2.2$: $f(C) = C^{2.2}$.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Calculate the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance_%28relative%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">relative luminance<\/a> as a weighted average of the linear RGB component values: $$Y = 0.2126\\, R_L + 0.7152\\, G_L + 0.0722\\, B_L$$ (The weights are exactly the same as for the luma formula above, because that's where they come from; the luma calculation just blindly applies them to the gamma-compressed RGB values.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Convert the relative luminance value into an approximation of the percieved lightness, using something like the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB\" rel=\"nofollow\">CIELAB<\/a> formula: $\\ell^* = 1.16\\, g(Y) - 0.16$, where: $$g(Y) = \\begin{cases} \\tfrac13 \\left(\\tfrac{29}{6}\\right)^2 Y + \\tfrac{4}{29} &amp; \\text{if } 0 \\le Y \\le \\left(\\tfrac{6}{29}\\right)^3\\\\ Y^{1/3} &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$ (Note: In the CIELAB standard, the $L^*$ value ranges from 0 to 100, but for the sake of consistency, in the formula above I chose to define $\\ell^* = L^* / 100$, so that its range is also from 0 to 1.)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":19486,"question_id":7340,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7340/hsl-lightness-vs-eye-sensitivity","last_activity_date":1404504352,"creation_date":1361680630,"answer_count":1,"title":"HSL Lightness vs Eye sensitivity","body":"<p>In a monochromatic spectrum, is the human eye equally able to distinguish between lighter colors just as it is in distinguishing between darker colors?

It is dominant or recessive compared to another allele. Therefore, if you consider one locus (position on a sequence) that has two alleles (bi-allelic locus), you cannot have two dominant or two recessive alleles. It is like saying that two things are darker. In reality you can either say that one is darker than the other one or that the color is as dark as the other one. So either one allele is dominant (or partially dominant) and the other is necessarily recessive (or partially recessive) or the two alleles are codominant.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Think of a gene that influence a phenotypic trait such as tail length for example. This locus is bi-allelic (two different alleles (=variant of a gene) exist (=segregate) at this locus). We'll call the two alleles $A$ and $B$. An individual that homozygous $AA$ has trait value $M_{AA}$. The homozygotes $AB$ have trait value $M_{AB}$ and individuals $BB$ have trait values $M_{BB}$. Viewing this in a table it gives:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{c|lcr}\n\\text{Genotype} &amp; \\text{Tail length} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{AA} &amp; M_{AA}\\\\\n\\text{AB} &amp; M_{AB}\\\\\n\\text{BB} &amp; M_{BB}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The following table gives the tail length of the different genotypes under the different types of interactions (dominance, partial dominance and co-dominance).<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{c|lcr}\n\\text{Interaction} &amp; \\text{AA} &amp; \\text{AB} &amp; \\text{BB} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{A is dominant and B is recessive} &amp; M_{AA} &amp; M_{AA} = M_{AB} &amp; M_{BB} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\ &amp; &amp; M_{AA} &gt; M_{AB} &gt; M_{BB}\\\\\n\\text{Partial Dominance} &amp; M_{AA} &amp; \\text{or} &amp; M_{BB} \n\\\\ &amp; &amp; M_{AA} &lt; M_{AB} &lt; M_{BB} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{Codominance} &amp; M_{AA} &amp; M_{AB} = \\frac{M_{AA} + M_{BB}}{2} &amp; M_{BB} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Because, in the codominance case $M_{AB}$ is necessarily between the values of $M_{AA}$ and $M_{BB}$ ($M_{AA} &gt; M_{AB} &gt; M_{BB}$ or $M_{AA} &lt; M_{AB} &lt; M_{BB}$), one can consider codominance as being a special case of partial dominance where neither $A$ or $B$ dominates because they both contribute as much to the determination of the tail length.<\/p>\n\n<p>Various definitions may exist for such concepts as well as for overdominance (also sometimes called heterozygous advantage) or stabilizing selection for examples. Those definitions differ in the sense that they sometimes apply to the value of the quantitative trait, to the fitness value (which is another quantitative trait) or to genetic polymorphism. <\/p>\n","answer_id":19475,"question_id":19466,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1404477613},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2442ea911c89187262d6575d739a1ca7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5148,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5148/swbarnes2","reputation":1824,"display_name":"swbarnes2"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1404491257,"creation_date":1404491257,"body":"<p>Shorter answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>The dominant/recessive paradigm that is taught in middle school and high school is not universally applicable.

I then used those numbers to reverse engineer how much of each compound would be needed for the measurements to be correct.  Some of the measurements added up while others didn't. The red and blue text are the measurements used for sodium and chlorine, respectively, because they worked against each other. Also, the oxygen and hydrogen didn't add up exactly with the water so that's what the green and yellow text is. From this we see that most of the measurements are off by substantial amounts. This also shows that certain elements exist beyond the compounds stated in the show throughout the body. So although the show is simpler and fun to quote, it's not scientifically correct.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PiZc3.png\" alt=\"humanchemicalbreakdown\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PiZc3.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Full size image)<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p>If you notice anything that stands out or that I missed, feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to correct myself or see your perspective.

Sometimes you want to do this because for example the ligand for a receptor in lets say Drosophila is very difficult to produce but the ligand for the mammalian receptor is easily available so what scientists do is that they attach the human cDNA corresponding to the extracellular side of the receptor to the Drosophila intercellular portion of the Drosophila receptor. Now you can intracellularly activate a Drosophila receptor using a human ligand for a receptor. Now I have never seen/heard of chimeric in vivo sequences and that just doesn't seem possible but what I imagine can happen when viewing sequencing data for a species that are not fully sequences is that the search engines says a particular sequence is from a different species that you have sequenced. This is because the database will try to find the closest match to the sequence. NCBI BLAST for example can do this but usually it gives you a percentage sequence matching/probability.

The population may go extinct, may remain at stable size or may grow indefinitely (theoretically speaking), may increase in size and then go extinct, etc\u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>This is at least true if you make the assumptions that the rates that govern transitions between age/stage classes (survival, growth, reproduction) are  stable over time. Your scenario is explicitly dealing with transitory population dynamics, i.e. it is asking about the population fluctuations that will happen before the age-structured population stabilizes (assuming it does stabilize at some point). <\/p>\n\n<p>To understand what will happen to your population you can model your population using a Leslie Matrix.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Leslie matrix<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Leslie matrix describes the age-specific survival and fecundity of individuals in a population. Shortly speaking, a population dynamic model using age-specific survival and fecundity looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CFnyq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Renaming the matrix and the two vectors you see above it gives: $n(t+1) = M \\cdot n(t)$, where $n(t)$ is the vector of number of individuals in the population at each age and $L$ is the Leslie matrix, where the first row gives the fecundity of each age ($f_2$ is the fecundity of the individuals of age class $s$ where the number of individuals is a given time is given by $n(t)$) and the lower diagonal gives the survival probability ($s_2$ is the probability of surviving from age 2 to age 3).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, basically to answer your question, define your Leslie matrix $L$, define $n(0)$ and iterate (left multiply your vector $n(t)$ several times) to see how the number of individuals change through time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Leslie Matrix and Linear Algebra<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The right leading eigenvector of $L$ gives the stationary distribution and the associated eigenvalue gives the growth rate $R$. If $0&lt;R&lt;1$, then the population size decreases through time if $R&gt;1$, the population size increases through time. $R$ cannot be lower than zero (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perron-Frobenius theorem<\/a> to understand why). Many biologically interesting features can be extrapolated from the Leslie matrix such as the average lifespan or wether you'd better to introduce individuals of a age 1 or of age 2 (for examples) in a natural population in order to prevent its extinction. The sensitivity of the population to change in parameter (such as an increasing mortality rate at lower age due to a new predator for example). You will find more information on the Leslie matrix on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki article<\/a> and on many other websites.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other ways to model using a Leslie Matrix<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One can also model age-structured population using right matrix multiplication (unlike the above example) and use row vector rather than column vector. The Leslie matrix may also be a function of various variables such as the population size. One can also extend the Leslie matrix to incorporate different class of individuals in the population (different genotypes or different sexes for examples).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Books<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Evolution-Age-Structured-Populations-Brian-Charlesworth/dp/0521459672/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404421829&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Brian%20charlesworth\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Charlesworth. 1994.

Firstly, I agree that the upper limit for Forster interaction distance is ~ 10-11 nm due to the rapid fall off of the effect. If I infer from your question correctly, you seem to be asking how to confirm a lack of FRET interaction is a result of no interction, or steric hindrance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Classical methods of confirmation can be learned from biochemsitry. For instance, co-immunoprecipitation and intermolecular linkage with pull-down.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the FRET interaction doesn't show a positive result, perhaps it's because the interaction is so tight and the probes are so close that they are prohibited from the FRET effect. That would suggest a strong interaction, and a co-immunoprecipitation should readily show you that you can pull down one protein, run the results on a western blot, and probe for the other protein. The second permutation is to pull down protein B, and probe for protein A. This is a confirmation that both proteins exist in complex. Failure to co-immunoprecipitate both proteins (especially when trying both permutations) would likely indicate that proteins A and B do not interact, or that their interaction is highly transient or very weak. Co-IP can be demonstrated in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, or in vivo, in their native state from cell lysates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enter the second technique. Various small molecule compounds of different molecular length can be used to make inter-molecular, amine-to-amine linkages. <a href=\"http://www.piercenet.com/product/bs3\" rel=\"nofollow\">See BS3 for example<\/a>. This works best in vivo, where incubation with a compound such as this would create cross-links between neighbouring proteins only with the reach of the englth of the compounds. If two proteins interact, then by definition they must be spatially close to each other, and therefore some percentage of your proteins should be in complex together. From there, you can run a western blot and show that you can probe for both proteins, that run at the same apparent molecular weight defined by the sum of both proteins molecular weights (and therefore both proteins will run higher than expected because their mass is modified by the addition of the interacting protein + linker). Modern versions of this approach involve using mass spec identification of cross-linked fragments, which is much more sensitive and quantitative that western blotting.<\/p>\n\n<p>A third method could be quantitative colocalization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Prepare cells for immunofluorescence, probing for both proteins of interest, and quantitatively assess whether the proteins co-localize with each other. By eye (and not so rigorously), you would expect that both proteins should exhibit very similar spatial distributions within the cell if they are in fact interacting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Failure of the above two methods strongly supports the idea that the proteins do not interact, or that they do interact in very weak or very transient conditions. The only way to truly exclude the idea that they do interact in a very weak/transient manner is if you know that the protein complex does something in a cell. If they do something while in complex, then you can knock one protein out, or express a recombinant mutated form of the protein, and assay for the lack of the normal action.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19463,"question_id":19416,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19416/fret-only-works-for-interactions-between-1nm-to-20nm","last_activity_date":1404417056,"creation_date":1404235269,"answer_count":3,"title":"FRET only works for interactions between 1nm to 20nm.","body":"<p>FRET only works for interactions between 1nm to 20nm.<\/p>\n\n<p>How can you be sure that the interaction that you want to study isn't less than 1 nm/greater than 20nm apart?<\/p>\n","question_id":19416,"tags":["molecular-biology"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e9a3a9b4604655e672c409c628e362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1607,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1607/larry-harson","reputation":151,"display_name":"Larry Harson"},"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user560"},"score":0,"post_id":5099,"edited":false,"creation_date":1351892711,"comment_id":7239,"body":"Can you point to some references that show the UK population has higher pheomelanin?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e9a3a9b4604655e672c409c628e362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1607,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1607/larry-harson","reputation":151,"display_name":"Larry Harson"},"score":0,"post_id":5099,"edited":false,"creation_date":1351897395,"comment_id":7241,"body":"@leonardo not at the moment, so I&#39;ve removed this statement from the question.

First you need to decide, what your target organism which you want to infect is (e.g. mammalian cells, bacterial cells) and based on that you choose your viral vector as listed in this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector\" rel=\"nofollow\">article<\/a>. Generally for mammalian cell stable transfection (usually you want the genetic materials you introduced to persist between cell divisions hence stable transfection) and transformation (just a general statement about changing cells as you have introduced, usually foreign genetic material but transformation is not necessarily the same as making something immortalised, which means the cells won't stop dividing i.e. becoming cell lines or in lay term cancerous) scientists tend to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">lentiviruses<\/a>, which are retroviruses, similar to HIV and they can even infect non dividing cells (so this should allow your imagination to run wild!). Once you have decided what the best viral vehicle for targeting your cells of interest is then you essentially transfect the plasmid DNA (packaging vector), which produces the virus protein package, into cells, whose job becomes to produce the virus as those cells have the required cellular machinery for this purpose. These cells are often 293T packaging cells. Along with the plasmid (circular) DNA, which produces the virus package, you co-transfect the packaging (e.g. 293T) cells with another plasmid, called lenti-vector, which does whatever you want it do, such as express a particular protein or microRNA or whatever but the idea is that stuff produces by the lenti-vector should not be toxic to the target cell (i.e. the cells you intend to target), unless thats what you want it to do.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now as you can see, you can play around with two things here, first the packaging vector, to change the behaviour of the virus if you wish. And second the lenti-virus vector, to produce whatever you want it to! Once the packaging cells made your viruses, containing your lenti-vector, the virus get secreted into the media, which the packaging cells are in so you have to extract the media, congaing the virus, and concentrate the virus using centrifugation. Once you got the virus then you can use it to transform the (target) cells you wish. <\/p>\n\n<p>For the lab based procedure of how you make the virus and what equipments you use and how to concentrate the virus then please see this <a href=\"http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/compbio/research/labprotocols/contentBlocks/0/contentBlock_files/file15/Lentivirus_Production_and_Transfection_Protocol.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">link<\/a>, although its a little technical. In this case, the packaging vector is fuGENE 6 and the lenti-vector or just plasmids of interests are listed (please not that I do not endorse any products mentioned here and I'm just using it as an example).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now for making the packaging plasmid (making the virus), you often use the genetic materials from a virus and change it through a procedure called polymerase chain reaction (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">PCR<\/a>). Same goes for the lenti-vector/plasmid as they are derived from somewhere and then change through time using PCR and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest\" rel=\"nofollow\">restriction digests<\/a>, which is an equivalent of genetic material cut and paste, to make the vectors and products of interest. Once all is done the the virus can infect the target cells and effect it based on its designed function (defined by the two vectors I described).<\/p>\n\n<p>If the above response does not answer you question, since it is currently very broad, please make further clarification to the question so that I can modify my response accordingly.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19393,"question_id":19388,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1404202240},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1404154930,"creation_date":1404154500,"body":"<p>I would not start from so bottom as Bez in making viruses. \nThis is very very long project.\nIt is much less cumbersome task to consider modifying virus, since it already occurs passively in real life.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would choose equipment based on the characteristics of the virus. \nI would start to develop equipment needed for the specific project, since there is no ready solution for this kind of task. \nThe equipment can be targeted to <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>actively changing virus (ss(-) and ss(+) RNA virus)<\/li>\n<li>virus not changing so much (here you have to think how you ignite the point mutation and why).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I would use iPS stem cells to as an target but to get this far is very very long process still. \nI would focus on antigen presentation - again very many fine regulation factors in Interferons etc should be considered in the special viral case - note that the interferon research is now in an active phase but early. \nInterferons are specific so specific parts of the equipment should exists to detect them - for instance, IFN-gamma.<\/p>\n\n<p>Viruses are generally extremely difficult to control - shortly existing in one form. \nYou can imagine how difficult they become after editing them real life.\nSo the plan would be first to understand some easy virus and its early stages in the replication. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can actually choose a virus that undergoes continuously point mutations (drift mutation) like influenza virus. \nHowever, I would pick something that is not so changing (not RNA virus). \nThere is no good equipment to do regular analysis of the changes in the influenza virus. \nIt always requires much work to recognize which genome part has changed and how much internationally. \nThe vaccines are made based on reports from many countries about their influenza virus statuses and their genomes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some simple DNA virus with very slow but fixed point mutations in time so you have time to research them and you can estimate when the next change is going to be. \nIt would be also useful if you know which part of the virus is going to change (particular plasmid).\nThis makes the research much more manageable.\nSufficient time-series analysis and group of Mathematicians are also needed to understand different data from different stages.\nActually, your task is extremely broad.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19394,"question_id":19388,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1404154930},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1404212216,"creation_date":1404205714,"body":"<p><em>Consider this as a summary of the previous answers. Also, I am elaborating more on how to make self-sustaining mutated viruses<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Points to consider before you think about working with viruses:-<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viruses are pathogenic and the biologist working on them faces a risk of infection. Viral work is always carried out in a protected environment at high <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level\" rel=\"nofollow\">biosafety levels<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Viruses need a host to survive. You need to culture host cells or use a live organism to propagate the virus. Generally one goes for the latter only if cell culture methods are unfeasible.<\/li>\n<li>Almost all viruses have a very small genome (which can be replicated very fast), that can be either DNA or RNA. The genome has only very few essential genes that are responsible for the virus capsid (external shell) formation and early replication; most other factors required for the propagation are hijacked from the host.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Having identified and obtained a suitable host, one can proceed to genetic manipulation. The lentiviral vectors that Bez described are basically partial viruses. One part codes for the capsid and cannot make active viruses by itself whereas the other holds the genes for replicative function. So in a way the lentiviral vectors are disarmed viruses that are used as molecular biology tools. But what you are looking for is different.<\/p>\n\n<p>To modify a virus you need to make mutations in its genome. Once you have identified what mutations are to be made then as previously mentioned, PCR can be used to incorporate them. This technique is slightly different from a usual PCR (not in principle, though) and is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">site-directed mutagenesis<\/a>. For ease it is always better to clone (fix) the viral genome in a plasmid (circular DNA that can be propagated in a usual lab bacteria- <em>E.Coli<\/em>). After mutating the viral genome, you can excise it from the plasmid. Note that PCR is done with DNA. For RNA viruses you need to convert its genome into a DNA sequence before you go for site-directed mutagenesis. Conventional technique would be to reverse-transcribe the viral RNA. But nowadays chemical DNA synthesis has become quite easy and you can synthesize entire viral genome in a \"test-tube\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Having done this, we proceed to the trickiest part: <em>How to get this genome to form an active virus?<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>Some viruses, as mentioned before use RNA as their genome (poliovirus, retroviruses, common-cold virus etc) while some use DNA (chickenpox, smallpox, herpes etc). The mutagenesis, however, is performed on the DNA. For DNA viruses, introduction of the viral DNA into the host cell, using the conventional transfection methods, might work. For certain RNA viruses like poliovirus this DNA has to be transcribed to RNA. This can be done using a technique called <a href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/In_vitro_transcription_with_T7_RNA_polymerase\" rel=\"nofollow\">in-vitro transcription (IVT)<\/a> and the RNA product can be introduced inside the cell. IVT wont work well for long RNAs. In such cases you can use the cell itself to make the RNA instead of doing it in-vitro. Use a plasmid that can transcribe a DNA sequence inside a host cell- this is fairly common and almost all molecular bio labs will have such plasmids. Transfect this plasmid inside the host cell and it will make viral RNA, which in-turn will make active viruses.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Retroviruses work slightly different from other RNA viruses. They have an RNA genome that they convert to a DNA. This DNA gets integrated in the host genome and keeps producing viruses. To make a retroviral DNA integrate you need an enzyme encoded in the virus- <strong>integrase<\/strong>.

Humans have three different types,\n  each sensitive to a different color of light. With only one cone type,\n  you couldn\u2019t differentiate between different colors (<a href=\"http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/cuttlefish-colorblind-masters-camouflage/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A study was conducted in the lab of <a href=\"http://hermes.mbl.edu/mrc/hanlon/mathger.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr Lydia M. Mäthger<\/a> where two different checkerboards were used to test their colorblindness. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) Gray \u2013 Green. One green shade, matched to the maximum absorption\n  wavelength of cuttlefish, was combined with 16 different shades of\n  gray. As supposed some shades of gray couldn\u2019t be distinguished from\n  the green by the cuttlefish, which didn\u2019t adapt the body pattern.\n  Experiment one was successful.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>2) Blue \u2013 Yellow. A checkerboard of blue and yellow matching in\n  intensity was used for the second experiment. The skin color of the\n  test species didn\u2019t change either and therefore experiment two was\n  also successful (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16376404\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These experiments concluded that it was indeed colourblind.<\/p>\n\n<p>To confirm the effectiveness of the camouflage, HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) was used to measure the colour match between the cuttlefish and its background. Using this technology it was perceived as to how a predator would view a camouflaged cuttlefish. It was found that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cuttlefish can produce color-coordinated camouflage on natural\n  substrates despite lacking color vision, and that the color aspect of\n  cuttlefish camouflage is highly effective against fish predators. Much\n  of the contrast information (which allows a predator to \"pick out\" a\n  cuttlefish from the background environment) resides in the brightness\n  (luminance) rather than in the color (chromatic) aspect of the\n  reflected light. What this means is that cuttlefish camouflage\n  strategies take away a tool from predators in their ability to pick\n  out their prey from the background and instead leave them with only\n  brightness as a method for prey identification (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576487\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference 1<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-05/mbl-hca051611.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference 2<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And now we get to the main question as to how they do it. Cuttlefish are apparently able to detect the intensity of light reflected from objects in its surroundings. It is able to perceive even a 15% change in contrast. In an experiment, it was found that <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The animals did not respond to the checkerboard pattern when placed on\n  substrates whose color intensities were matched to the Sepia visual\n  system, suggesting that these checkerboards appeared to their eyes as\n  uniform backgrounds (<a href=\"http://hermes.mbl.edu/news/features-archived/feature_cuttlefish.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In another bit of interesting research done on the ability to copy the patterns on checkerboards (<a href=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/12/2119.figures-only\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>), three inferences were drawn <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first find was that the range (relative to the size of the\n  cuttlefish \u2018white square\u2019) for the animal to exhibit disruptive skin\n  patterning had to be withing a certain  narrow range. Secondly, given\n  the appropriate size of checker, cuttlefish regulated their disruptive\n  skin patterns according to the contrast between white and black\n  squares. Third, by manipulating the number of white squares on a board to just  4\n  among 316 black squares (or 1.25 %) produced disruptive patterning,\n  yet increasing the number of white squares to 20, 40 or 80 did not\n  increase the frequency of appearance of the cuttlefish \u2018white square\u2019,\n  but only its clarity of expression.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This study shows that the number of white objects in the background significantly influence cuttlefish skin patterns further putting stress on its ability to view the polarization of light (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212000115\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sRGft.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/B46tK.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Some cuttlefish camouflage examples<\/p>\n","answer_id":19384,"question_id":19364,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1404187703}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19364/how-does-the-cuttlefish-camouflage-itself-accurately-despite-being-color-blind","last_activity_date":1404187703,"creation_date":1403939649,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does the Cuttlefish camouflage itself accurately despite being color-blind?","body":"<p>I have seen/read that the Cuttlefish is able to camouflage itself extremely accurately.

It has a thin cuticle over its body and requires moist skin which is achieved by a slimy mucous (<a href=\"http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~glauren/earthworm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>). It is interesting to note that earthworms are also capable of going into a state of hibernation called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestivation\" rel=\"nofollow\">estivation<\/a> (in American english) (<a href=\"http://www.learner.org/jnorth/search/WormNotes3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>) which helps them maintain a low metabolic state.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since you are planning to cover it with a cloth, the material of the cloth also matters.

White blood cells respond to different kind of stimuli (chemical) in two ways: either they are attracted (by inflammatory cytokines for example) either they are repelled. Macrophages are attracted by cytokines released when a pathogen agent triggers inflammatory response. They \"ingest\" that pathogen through phagocytosis and expose some parts of it (the antigens) on their surface receptors. This stimulates lymphocytes which process that antigen and decide if it is self or non-self. If it is non-self, they stimulate proliferation of specialized cells against that antigen. Another type of blood cells, the platelets, although they have no nucleus, have interesting properties: they can adhere to the broken endothelium where they change shape and start to produce different chemical mediators.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Read more on:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Chemotaxis,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chemotaxis&amp;oldid=600637322\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chemotaxis&amp;oldid=600637322<\/a> (accessed June 28, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Interferon,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interferon&amp;oldid=608718450\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interferon&amp;oldid=608718450<\/a> (accessed June 28, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Adaptive immune system,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_immune_system&amp;oldid=612379171\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_immune_system&amp;oldid=612379171<\/a> (accessed June 28, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Platelet,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Platelet&amp;oldid=614627651\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Platelet&amp;oldid=614627651<\/a> (accessed June 28, 2014).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":19368,"question_id":19360,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19360/can-any-human-cells-learn","last_activity_date":1403970169,"creation_date":1403908914,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can (any) human cells learn?","body":"<p>I'm not talking about single celled organisms, but actual cells in your body.

A higher number of daily meals is recommended to the elderly suffering from cardiovascular diseases [5] because less but square meals lead to a redistribution of blood to the gastro-intestinal tract to increase absorption, which causes reduction of blood pressure [6]. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Energy balance is more important than meal frequency. As this study says [7]:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... there is no evidence that weight loss on hypoenergetic regimens is altered by meal frequency.

In my experience, back-crossing allows you to generate a genetically-altered mouse that differs as little as possible from a (generally well-characterized) parent strain, except at the locus of the genetic manipulation. This way, any differences in phenotype can more easily be explained by the knockout/knockin/transgene/what-have-you, and not by any variations in background genetics. <\/p>\n\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000664.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">C57BL/6<\/a> mice, being inbred, have a number of well-known mutations, deficiencies, resistances, etc., and for one reason or another have become one of the most popular and most-characterized mouse strains in biology, so there is a great interest in continuing research using a well-known historical model with so much extant experimental data. These mice are quite different from the <a href=\"http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/002448.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">129<\/a> strain, which are frequently used to make initial genetically modified strains due to the large number of embryonic stem cell lines available, and other technical reasons which allow for the relatively easy generation of transgenics, etc. However, for various other reasons, 129s aren't used as often in the type of studies that BL/6s are, so it's preferable to create the mutation in a 129, then back-cross it onto a BL/6 background. Both of these strains are quite homogenous from one individual to another (each sibling is practically a twin of the next), but once you start breeding 129s to BL/6s you can generate all sorts of genetic heterogeneity due to random cross-overs and all the other things we like to talk so much about around here when it comes to mutations and meiosis. As anyone who has worked with genetic diseases in humans will readily tell you, it can be extraordinarily difficult to nail down specific genotypes that lead to specific phenotypes when there are so many other confounding factors present. Backcrossing a mutant 5, 10, or even 20 or more generations back onto a reference strain is one of the best ways we have at the moment of controlling for all the genetic variations that are introduced when two inbred \"tool\" strains are bred together.<\/p>\n\n<p>And now, cute pictures :)<\/p>\n\n<p>129 mouse<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oaVno.jpg\" alt=\"129\"><\/p>\n\n<p>C57BL/6 mouse<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HY3t9.jpg\" alt=\"C57BL/6\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sup>both images from <a href=\"http://www.criver.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles River<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":19359,"question_id":19355,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19355/what-is-the-purpose-of-back-crossing-mice-for-multiple-generations","last_activity_date":1403906525,"creation_date":1403887126,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the purpose of back-crossing mice for multiple generations?","body":"<p>Occasionally I will come across articles that refer to back-crossing mice of one strain onto the background other another strain (e.g., C57Bl6).

It was first suggested in the 1920s that simple organic molecules could form and spontaneously polymerize into macromolecules under the conditions thought to exist in primitive Earth's atmosphere. At the time life arose, the atmosphere of Earth is thought to have contained little or no free oxygen, instead consisting principally of $CO_2$ and $N_2$ in addition to smaller amounts of gases such as $H_2$, $H_2S$, and $CO$. Such an atmosphere provides reducing conditions in which organic molecules, given a source of energy such as sunlight or electrical discharge, can form spontaneously. The spontaneous formation of organic molecules was first demonstrated experimentally in the 1950s, when Stanley Miller (then a graduate student) showed that the discharge of electric sparks into a mixture of $H_2$, $CH_4$, and $NH_3$, in the presence of water, led to the formation of a variety of organic molecules, including several amino acids.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zQTPp.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Although Miller's experiments did not precisely reproduce the conditions of primitive Earth, they clearly demonstrated the plausibility of the spontaneous synthesis of organic molecules, providing the basic materials from which the first living organisms arose.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The next step in evolution was the formation of macromolecules. The monomeric building blocks of macromolecules have been demonstrated to polymerize spontaneously under plausible prebiotic conditions. Heating dry mixtures of amino acids, for example, results in their polymerization to form polypeptides. But the critical characteristic of the macromolecule from which life evolved must have been the ability to replicate itself. Only a macromolecule capable of directing the synthesis of new copies of itself would have been capable of reproduction and further evolution.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Of the two major classes of informational macromolecules in present-day cells (nucleic acids and proteins), only the nucleic acids are capable of directing their own self-replication. Nucleic acids can serve as templates for their own synthesis as a result of specific base pairing between complementary nucleotides. A critical step in understanding molecular evolution was thus reached in the early 1980s, when it was discovered in the laboratories of Sid Altman and Tom Cech that RNA is capable of catalyzing a number of chemical reactions, including the polymerization of nucleotides. RNA is thus uniquely able both to serve as a template for and to catalyze its own replication. Consequently, RNA is generally believed to have been the initial genetic system, and an early stage of chemical evolution is thought to have been based on self-replicating RNA molecules\u2014a period of evolution known as the RNA world. Ordered interactions between RNA and amino acids then evolved into the present-day genetic code, and DNA eventually replaced RNA as the genetic material.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The first cell is presumed to have arisen by the enclosure of self-replicating RNA in a membrane composed of phospholipids.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lk7dW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Phospholipids are the basic components of all present-day biological membranes, including the plasma membranes of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The key characteristic of the phospholipids that form membranes is that they are amphipathic molecules, meaning that one portion of the molecule is soluble in water and another portion is not. Phospholipids have long, water-insoluble (hydrophobic) hydrocarbon chains joined to water-soluble (hydrophilic) head groups that contain phosphate. When placed in water, phospholipids spontaneously aggregate into a bilayer with their phosphate-containing head groups on the outside in contact with water and their hydrocarbon tails in the interior in contact with each other. Such a phospholipid bilayer forms a stable barrier between two aqueous compartments\u2014for example, separating the interior of the cell from its external environment.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The enclosure of self-replicating RNA and associated molecules in a phospholipid membrane would thus have maintained them as a unit, capable of self-reproduction and further evolution. RNA-directed protein synthesis may already have evolved by this time, in which case the first cell would have consisted of self-replicating RNA and its encoded proteins.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Source:<\/em><\/strong> Cooper GM.

Selection selects between various objects/units that differ. These objects may be genes, individuals, populations, species, etc\u2026 In other words, there are various level of selection or different units on which selection acts. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, it is often assumed better to think in terms of selection acting on alleles (gene variants) or on individuals. Therefore, we tend to think that selection acting on genes or on individuals is more effective than selection acting on species. However, selection acts on species and we should not necessarily discard explanation using the concept of species selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>What you say, if I am not mistaken, if we consider a set of species that are either mortal or immortal, we would predict that selection would benefit the mortal ones. Stating differently, mortal species have some advantage over immortal species that allow them to not get extinct or eventually to speciate more.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I don't quite understand the reasons why immortality would be deleterious to species. You say that it leads to overpopulation. So would you expect that a population is lead to overpopulation due to immortality and suddenly disappear because it is overcrowded. It doesn't sound like a well formulated argument to me. You could however argue that mortal species have a much greater individual turnover allowing them to adapt faster to environmental change than would immortal species.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19287,"question_id":19283,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1403799860}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19283/senescence-immortality-and-evolution","last_activity_date":1403799860,"creation_date":1403552588,"answer_count":1,"title":"Senescence, immortality and evolution?","body":"<p>Many have heard about the fabled \"immortal\" jellyfish, <em>Turritopsis dohrnii<\/em>, which doesn't die from aging (senescence) and can revert the aging process indefinitely.

Then add to this the fact that most carbon atoms in biomolecules are tetravalent so that even when they are part of a chain they can be linked to other functional groups 'hanging off' the chain (such as amino acid side chains).<\/p>\n\n<p>This combination of properties is unique to carbon.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19334,"question_id":19322,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19322/why-are-we-carbon-based","last_activity_date":1403771752,"creation_date":1403744855,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why are we carbon-based?","body":"<p>Is that because of evolution? \nDoes it have something to do with its amount in the universe?\nCarbon compounds form the basis of all known life on Earth, and the carbon-nitrogen cycle provides some of the energy produced by the Sun and other stars as I know. <\/p>\n","question_id":19322,"tags":["carbohydrates"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dade3c2b6b2f04cae2010646143c97c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8135,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8135/raghavakrishna","reputation":199,"display_name":"Raghavakrishna","accept_rate":43},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ecb2130d870caa97f33b9e9e658e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4109,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4109/resonating","reputation":3125,"display_name":"Resonating"},"score":1,"post_id":19314,"edited":false,"creation_date":1403723178,"comment_id":27471,"body":"Codons are like &#39;put green ink here&#39;.

I would like to make a fine distinction between evolution and dynamic adaptation and add some comments about relative evolvabilities of different biological networks. <\/p>\n\n<p>Given an architecture, a network can respond dynamically to different inputs. The preferred paths may change and the output characteristics can vary. Example cases include the effect of environment on metabolism. Personally, I would not consider this as network evolution because the architecture remains the same. Network evolution refers to rewiring or addition of new connections. <\/p>\n\n<p>It would be apt to classify the biological networks like this: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>molecular networks<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gene regulatory networks (GRN)<\/li>\n<li>Molecular (protein-protein) interaction networks (PPI)<\/li>\n<li>Cell signaling networks <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>cellular networks<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neural networks<\/li>\n<li>Biofilms (?)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p>organismal networks <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ecological networks (food webs etc)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are several ways in which a network can evolve: Edge addition, edge deletion, edge modification, node addition, node deletion and node duplication. <\/p>\n\n<p>In molecular networks <strong>edge modification<\/strong> happens when the chemical interaction is affected. For e.g. in a gene regulatory network a promoter-Transcription Factor (TF) interaction can change if there is a mutation in promoter sequence or in the DNA binding domain of TF. Similar situation exists in the cases of PPI and ligand-receptor interactions (Though concept of mutation doesn't apply to ligands). \nGene (node) <strong>duplications<\/strong> are also common mechanism of evolution of GRN. Gene <strong>deletions<\/strong>/inactivations also change the network and in some cases result in complex diseases. Metabolic networks evolve if an enzyme mutates and a new pathway is created. \nUsually <strong>node additions<\/strong> rarely happen; <strong>node duplications<\/strong> and <strong>edge modifications<\/strong> are more common in molecular networks. <\/p>\n\n<p>In neural networks the plasticity is higher than molecular networks. There is a basic architecture that is essential to support life but the connections keep changing, nonetheless, in the non-core regions. Since active neurogenesis stops after a certain point, we can assume that number of nodes remains unchanged but <strong>edge addition<\/strong> (new synapse), <strong>edge deletion<\/strong> (synaptic pruning) and <strong>edge modification<\/strong> (long term potentiation/depression) is quite rampant and widespread. In neurodegenerative diseases neurons die and therefore nodes are lost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ecological networks are affected by environment and geological barriers. So there are several subnetworks (ecosystems) that are weakly or strongly connected with each other. Introduction of foreign species (<strong>node addition<\/strong>) causes immediate perturbation of the <strong>local<\/strong> network architecture. Long term effects arise because of extinction (<strong>node deletions<\/strong>), speciation (<strong>node evolution<\/strong> leading to <strong>edge modification<\/strong> i.e feeding habits etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also to be noted that in all the cases the effect of a change on a network depends on which node/edge is affected; hubs are under tight scrutiny and are protected from perturbations because any dysregulation can lead to network collapse. Some networks also follow the preferential attachment behavior (which appears contradictory to hub preservation as a mechanism). I <strong>guess<\/strong> that molecular networks do not employ preferential attachment whereas ecological networks do. <\/p>\n","answer_id":17710,"question_id":17696,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1401276570},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ecb2130d870caa97f33b9e9e658e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4109,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4109/resonating","reputation":3125,"display_name":"Resonating"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":0,"post_id":19309,"edited":false,"creation_date":1403717381,"comment_id":27465,"body":"Could you provide some databases and references which have the evolution of these networks recorded overtime?

only the disease).\nSo the strategy is to avoid drugs that immunosuppresess.\nIn a similar way, avoiding living style or habits that puts immunosystem down can help with HIV.\nDoing sport when you have slept badly many days and feel exhausted, puts your body under immunosuppression. \nSo the state of the disease or your physical wellbeing determines when sport is useful and when not.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other part of your question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To hit toiled before exercise is good because then<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and venous congestion. <\/li>\n<li>effect of exercise on constipation is one topic here;

The mutation rate varies along genome sequences, species and individuals. According to the recent DECODE study (Kong et al., 2012) a human mother transmit on average 15 mutations to her offspring and a human father transmit on average $25 + 2(g-20)$ mutations to his offsprings, where $g$ is the age of the father and where the formula stands only for father older than 20 years old.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Mutations happen by chance and are not directed toward creating some specific feature. But it is much more likely to create a round of color on the wings of a butterfly than creating the picture of Tom Sellek. The reason has to do with the developmental and biochemical pathways linking the given mutation to its phenotypic effect. Looking at a given mutation, you can understand how it yield to the modification of some phenotypic trait by looking at the biochemical and devlopmental pathways.<\/p>\n\n<p>3,4) The third point that you raise is called \"genetic drift\". Shortly speaking the concept of genetic drift may be called the good luck/bad luck effects. Stating differently genetic drift is the random sampling of alleles (gene variant) from a population. If some alleles are favored over some others at a given locus, then sampling is not 100% random but is not either 100% deterministic. The only case where genetic drift is absent is in infinite population (which is obviously an unrealistic case). Genetic drift is inversely propotional to population size and you'll understand it better by reading <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>5) When the mutation is at very low frequency, the mutation needs to be dominant in order to be expressed, this is true. But an allele may increase in frequency due to genetic drift up to the point that some individuals are homozygous for this allele and therefore express the trait. Dominance and recessivity are just extreme case of a continuum and most often alleles have intermediate level of dominance. Pleiotropy is also something to consider.

Every time a cell divides, there is an error rate of about one per billion. That's a very low error rate per division, but when you multiply it by the number of divisions, times the number of cells, times the number of individuals, times the number of years the species has existed... well, that's a lot of mutations. Mind you, way fewer mutations will get passed along to offspring, because the vast majority of mutations are non-advantageous (because there a lot more ways to make a bad butterfly than a good one). But that's the job of selection, not mutation.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Evolution is a step-by-step process. There doesn't just have to be mutation and advantage, there has to be an advantage every step of the way. If big circles were selected for, that means intermediate forms (smaller circles, perhaps?) were selected for too. A blob that sort of looks like Tom Selleck will not confer as many fitness advantages as a blob that looks a lot like Tom Selleck (assuming the butterflies' predators hate Magnum P.I., which as far as I'm concerned is a perfectly reasonable assumption ;-)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lots of butterflies get eaten by bad luck. But it's unlikely any trait was the result of one mutation in one individual (although it does happen sometimes). There are lots of mutations happening, and if one individual doesn't pass it along, another will. Think of this: maybe 100,000,000 years ago some butterfly developed a mutation that would be ten times more effective at discouraging predators than the owl-eye circles ... but then it got stepped on by a dinosaur. You'd never know it happened, and you're left eons later wondering how a way less impressive mutation happened.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There's natural selection, and there's sexual selection. Maybe the females don't like the owl-eye wings so those butterflies mate half as often as their more attractive brethren. But if the resulting offspring is four times more likely to survive, that ugly butterfly just won the gene pool lottery.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>That's a common misconception, traits don't have to be dominant in order to be selected for. Think of this: lactose intolerance is dominant, but in many populations lactose intolerant people are in the minority, because after the domestication of the cow being lactose intolerant was enough of a disadvantage to make those people less likely to have offspring.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>One of the concepts people most often lack when dealing with evolution is of scale. You're looking at a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of all the mutations that could have possibly happened and thinking, \"What are the odds that that happened, it seems so improbable!\" But that's because you're not seeing the trillions and trillions and trillions of mutations that could have happened if random chance had taken things in an ever so slightly different direction. SOMETHING had to happen, it's the laws of physics. You're only able to see and be amazed by what did happen... well, because it's the thing that ended up happening. The more you think about it, the easier it is to wrap your mind around.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19274,"question_id":19254,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19254/on-evolution-statistics","last_activity_date":1403628714,"creation_date":1403452971,"answer_count":2,"title":"On evolution statistics","body":"<p>This basic evolution theory question has been haunting me since childhood and I'm kind of embarrassed that I can't explain it yet:<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider a butterfly. It's wings have evolved to look like the eyes of an owl, so to prevent it's predators who are themselves preys of the owl to attack it.<\/p>\n\n<p>From what I've learned (and feel free to indulge me in the very basics if I get this wrong), natural selection suggests that the butterflies that didn't have the owl's eyes in their wings would be eaten, leaving the ones with the eyes to survive, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>But that implies that this useful trait appeared in the butterfly's wings by chance. Now, I know trillions of butterflies have been born before this, but trying to figure out the possibility of this to happen by chance doesn't look like it's plausible. Let's go through the things that have to work right before this trait is passed over:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>For a butterfly to be born in a different wing colour, it should be a genetic mutation which doesn't happen this often, for what I know.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The wings are composed of micro-scales. For every scale to compose an image so similar that confuses even us, the margin of error is very slim. It could be anything. It could be a picture of Tom Selleck for all we know. The scales must be in the correct spectrum of colour by a small margin of error. So that is already a very unlikely thing to happen.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Then, this butterfly cannot be eaten out of bad luck (mind you, the wings don't guarantee it will not be eaten, just enlarge her chances).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>It has to mate, which also is not a guarantee to happen, since nature deals with competition. If this butterfly we are considering is a male, the female must find the wings hot, instead of being afraid of those creepy eyes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The genes of this mutations must also be dominant, so when it mates and generates offspring, at least part of the new butterflies inherit this trait.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>And this is a simple example.

They have used labelled amino acid technique and mass spectrometry (SILAC) to make measurements of protein turnover. It is concluded that on average the turnover is 20 hours, which is correct in my experience when doing gene knockdowns in Drosophila (S2) cells using RNAis as we incubate the RNAi with cells for 72 hours to ensure most proteins that we targeting are degraded and we can see the desired effects in cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now getting to your questions regarding organelle turnover, you have to consider that cellular organells are very precious to the cells as most of them consume a lot of energy to build hence they are maintained unless they suffer critical damage, and they would become detrimental to the cellular integrity. In that case organells such as mitochondria undergo a specific type of degradation called mitophagy, which is a subtype of autophagy. Now I'm sure there are specific average times for the so called turn-over of cellular organelle under \"normal\" conditions but thats a slightly misleading view since the turnover can be tipped through reactive oxygen species (ROS) or ageing leading to less efficient cellular maintenance and buildup of toxic aggregated proteins or ROS.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now just to clarify the use of the word half-life in you last paragraph, half-life normally refers to the time it takes for half the molecules in a given system to degrade (or to be more correct Half-life is the amount of time required for a quantity to fall to half its value as measured at the beginning of the time period) so I do not agree with your use of the word half-life in the last paragraph of above question although human DNA does have a replication limit (Hayflick limit) of roughly 40-60 due to telomer shortening and afterwards the cells (due to the DNA) that no longer replicates will enter senescence and eventually die.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now getting to non-replicating, highly differentiated cells such as neurons, it still remains a mystery as to how neuronal DNA remains so highly stable (although DNA is a highly stable molecule (compared to RNA) and its further stabilised through histones), while undergoing many dynamic processes such as transcription (since if anything goes wrong the cells cannot be replaced at least in CNS) and how axons of some neurone that can reach over a meter in length are maintained so well for decades. There is a lively argument amongst the scientific community about this, which you can find out about if you simply search for axonal maintenance in a search engine.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this answers some of your questions.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17294,"question_id":14409,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14409/what-are-the-lifetimes-of-cellular-components-on-organelle-or-molecular-level","last_activity_date":1403546367,"creation_date":1389415494,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are the lifetimes of cellular components on organelle or molecular level?","body":"<p>I was thinking that even though I know how generally the cell works, I don't really have a feeling of how volatile it is.\nI want to know what is the lifetime/turnover rate of different constituents of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the molecular level what are the lifetimes for various proteins, for ribosome, lipids, carbohydrates, DNA and RNA.

Some species are 1N (haploid), some are 3N (triploid), etc\u2026 It would actually be more correct to talk about the time a species spend in each of its phase or talk about the number of cells in each of its phase because many species undergo change in chromosome number during their existence as it is the case for humans. Humans are 2N most of the time but they are 1N when they are ovules or spermatozoid. The correct word to describe the human <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">lifecycle<\/a> is diplontic. Some species are diplontic, some are haplodiplontic and some have phases when they have a greater number of chromosomes. Those species are said to be polyploid.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ploidy number, chromosomes and chromatids<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To make sure one don't mix up things... One chromosome is made of one or two chromatids (depending on the cellular phase). The chromatids of the same chromosome (called sister chromatids) are (almost completely) identical. A given \"chromosome type\" is either alone (1N) or accompagnied by one very similar chromosome (2N) or two other very similar chromsomes (3N), etc.. Considering the case of a 2N individual: If at a given locus (position in the chromosome) the two alleles (gene variant) are different than the individual is said to be heterozygote for this locus. The ploidy number describe \"this number of chromosomes\"! Now there may have different number of different \"types of chromosomes\". Humans for example have 23 different types of chromosomes and in its haploid phase has therefore 23 chromosomes (23 or 46 chromatids depending on the cellular phase) and has 46 chromosomes (46 or 92 chromatids depending on the cellular phase) in its diploid phase  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ploidy number in angiosperms and other plants and non-plants organisms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, D. Attenborough (who I don't know and I haven't read anything of his work) probably means doubling, tripling, quadrupling, .. the number of N of chromosomes. And, yes indeed polyploidy (3N, 4N, 6N, 8N) is relatively often observed in flowering plants. There are many crop species that are polyploid. According to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> an important part of the speciation that occurred in plants is accompanied by a change in ploidy number but this is not only true for angiosperms.<\/p>\n\n<p>Polyploidy is also found in many fungi species and some animal species as well. There are lots of terminologies linked with the discussion of chromosome number and reproductive system and many articles discuss these mechanisms and also the evolution of polyploidy. I found the work of Sally Otto to be of the greatest interest for example.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The words inventions are not really used in evolutionary biology but rather in popular books. Also, there are many non-angiosperm plants that have symbiotic relationship with animals. For examples: some angiosperms and the squirrels or birds. But it is true that angiosperm have particularly important symbiotic relationship with animals, in particular insects and this probably allowed an important diversification in both angiosperms and insects. As already said angiosperms are not the taxon of plants to include polyploid species. There are other characteristics that allow to tell an angiosperm apart from other plants.

This is a quite common mechanism of transmission when drug addicts share and re-use needles and syringes and also in third world hospitals with poor hygiene standards.<\/p>\n\n<p>A drop of blood is considered infectious at least until it has completely dried up (some research showed that it might be contagious for up to 5 days longer when the conditions are right, see reference 1 below). Mostly HIV is senstive against high temperatures (over 60°C), while it is stable at low temperatures. It is very sensitive against shifts in pH (below 7 or above 8) and also against desinfectants like bleach.
