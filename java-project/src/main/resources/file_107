This is more of a highlight and primer sort of response to a somewhat subjective question so pardon if this isn't what you wanted. I don't have paper references for all this, but I'll try to come back and add some later - I usually only have half an hour or so to write an answer so bear with me. <\/p>\n\n<p>Synthetic biology as defined as the use of genes and promoters to engineer cells or even multicellular organisms like devices is a major category.  I like browsing the projects from the <a href=\"http://www.igem.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">iGem Competitions<\/a>.  A couple of outstanding efforts in this field are the use of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3053042/\" rel=\"nofollow\">photoreceptors to program E coli gene expression<\/a> and the general effort to create logic and computational circuits in the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>A major application in systems biology is engineering cells to produce new chemical compounds or to overproduce compounds.  A classic example (sort of old, but still pretty outstanding) is the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12051.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">engineering of E coli to produce the antimalarial drug artemisinin<\/a> at levels which would enable world wide release of the drug.  This has inspired efforts to produce fuel from algae and bacteria as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you define Systems biology as being often concerned with modeling some or even all the biological processes of the cell, there are probably too many major efforts to cite, but this is just a list of some favorites. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of papers focused on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_balance_analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">flux balance analysis<\/a> which models how the metabolic machinery processes and synthesizes all the scores of chemical compounds that make up a cell.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Another category of synbio tries to take the genes found in a genome and model the actions of all the genes.  One of the most exciting papers to come out in this sort of systems biology is the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763\" rel=\"nofollow\">whole cell model of Mycobacterium genetalium<\/a>.  Using data from a massive effort to characterize every gene in this very small genome, the model consists of over 20 specific models which have combined to make a very impressive simulation of the entire cell dividing.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is metagenomics, which looks at the different populations of microorganisms and tries to look at how they vary with different environmental conditions. A recent paper that's exciting is the review of <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/13/the-mucus-lover-that-stops-mice-from-getting-fat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">how different bacteria dominate in the gut of obese mice and people<\/a> (several references in the link).

Gain-of-function oncogenic mutations are frequently heterozygous events or may represent a single allele of an amplified gene; thus, the signal for mutated residues is typically reduced relative to neighboring bases. Moreover, the ability to detect single base mutations or small insertions or deletions in biopsy material by Sanger sequencing depends heavily on sample purity (for example, the extent of contaminating stromal DNA) and genomic DNA integrity. Furthermore, resistance to kinase inhibitors may correlate with low-frequency second-site mutations. These observations underscore the challenges for accurate mutation detection in cancer specimens.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis approach, \u2018picotiter plate pyrosequencing,\u2019 provides a new alternative to Sanger sequencing. This approach relies on emulsion PCR-based clonal amplification of a DNA library adapted onto micron-sized beads and subsequent pyrosequencing-by-synthesis of each clonally amplified template in a picotiter plate, generating over 200,000 unique clonal sequencing reads per experiment. Sequence variants that represent a fraction of a complex sample can be vastly oversampled, thus enabling statistically meaningful quantification of low-abundance variants.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":8348,"question_id":8343,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1368531843}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8343/why-is-sanger-sequencing-inferior-for-detecting-snps-in-cancer-cells","last_activity_date":1368532691,"creation_date":1368480488,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is Sanger sequencing inferior for detecting SNPs in cancer cells?","body":"<p>I am familiar with Sanger sequencing, but at the level of an undergraduate.

This can be quite challenging and it depends on many issues that is out scope of this post to discuss them all  <\/li>\n<li>If you are interested in performing these two assays using only one 96-well ELISA plate and examine validity of different sample matrices, sample buffer (lysis buffer or sometimes called extraction buffer) for a certain analyte, say X, then this scheme below is for you:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zThos.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Technical Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In this scheme, recovery is examined in 3 types of solutions; <code>assay buffer<\/code>, <code>sample buffer<\/code> and <code>samples<\/code>. These are different in their complexity. Typically, the assay buffer is usually optimized to detect the standard protein provided with the commercial kit  <\/li>\n<li>The idea of <code>spike-and-recovery<\/code> is that you add a certain amount from standard stock solution into the wells containing the solution to be tested (e.g., sample buffer or samples) and measure them, to see whether you can recover that amount again, and how much you can recover from it in %. If, for any reason, you couldn't recover that amount in comparison with a control well, where that same amount was added into assay buffer, then this means that something in the test solution is not in favor of the assay. The specific amount you add into the wells is called <code>spike<\/code>, and it should be the same amount across all tested wells (try to be consistent). Make sure that the added amount when diluted in the well, its final concentration should still be measured by the assay and lie inside your standard curve. E.g., if your standard curve is from 4- 4500 pg/mL, and each well has 100µl of sample, if you want now to add spike into that sample well, you may add whatever amount you want that will still give you at the end a reading inside the standard curve, you may choose to add 10µl from the highest stock which is 500pg/mL, so you end up here with 1/10, that is 50pg/mL, which is fine as it lies inside the 4-500pg/mL range. Alternatively, you can add 50µl sample + 50µl spike (500pg/mL) and would end up with 1/2 dilution (which is the same in this scheme), that is 250pg/mL, which is also fine. So it is up to you to choose, keeping in mind the final concentration should lie inside your standard curve  <\/li>\n<li>For the <code>linearity-of-dilution<\/code>, it is obvious that you need a high concentration solution that you can make two-fold (or whatever fold you like) serial dilution from and its reading should still lie inside the standard curve. The best candidate for this is the high spiked wells. The <code>LOD<\/code> would tell you about the effect of different dilutions on the precision of the assay  <\/li>\n<li>For <code>SAR<\/code> and <code>LOD<\/code> you will get at the end an average percentage from 3 samples at least (calculation example will be provided later), I added a fourth sample, but this fourth can be a different sample type, say samples from tissue culture, so it is up to you to re-design this scheme and be innovative   <\/li>\n<li>Choosing the best dilution is not an easy task, it is not without compromises sometimes. For example, if you have a harsh sample buffer, you may not have good recovery at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 dilutions of the <code>sample buffer<\/code> in <code>assay buffer<\/code>, whereas almost good recovery is achieved at 1/16, then this dilution factor is most probably the one you should go for in your assay. On the other hand, 1/16 might not be detected by your ELISA assay, which is limited by its sensitivity. Here, the <code>E<\/code> wells can give you a clue whether you detect something in these unspiked samples or not, that's why I recommend you include at least one sample of high expected value of the analyte in question (this is not easy sometimes to predict) in this scheme, here this is sample 3. One more thing, if you get good recovery at 1/16 DO NOT go to 1/32 or 1/64, as it is obvious that with these higher dilutions you are reducing the chance of the analyte's detectability as it is limited by your assay's sensitivity  <\/li>\n<li>In most of the cases, you will see that the dilution factor of good recovery of the <code>sample buffer<\/code> in columns 3 and 4, will coincide with that of the <code>spiked samples<\/code> in columns 5, 7, and 9.

Homocysteine inhibits the function of thrombomodulin, an anticoagulant glycoprotein on the endothelial surface that serves as a cofactor for the activation of protein C by thrombin. The effects of homocysteine on thrombomodulin expression and protein C activation were investigated in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and CV-1(18A) cells that express recombinant human thrombomodulin. Addition of 5 mM homocysteine to endothelial cells produced slight increases in thrombomodulin mRNA and thrombomodulin synthesis without affecting cell viability. In both cell types, thrombomodulin synthesized in the presence of homocysteine remained sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H and failed to appear on the cell surface, suggesting impaired transit along the secretory pathway. In a cell-free protein C activation assay, homocysteine irreversibly inactivated both thrombomodulin and protein C in a process that required free thiol groups and was inhibited by the oxidizing agents diamide or N-ethylmaleimide. By inhibiting both thrombomodulin surface expression and protein C activation, homocysteine may contribute to the development of thrombosis in patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":8333,"question_id":8328,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8328/by-what-mechanism-does-elevated-homocysteine-level-accelerate-thrombin-formation","last_activity_date":1368459580,"creation_date":1368442595,"answer_count":1,"title":"By what mechanism does elevated homocysteine level accelerate thrombin formation?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/8300/1413\">It has been stated<\/a> that elevated homocysteine level accelerates thrombin formation.

This means that they have reservoirs outside a single host, and hence of course reinfection with the exact strain is possible if this strain leaves the body and at a later stage is carried back to it. This could typically happen for example with the common influenza, spreading from one child to other children at school and later being carried back to the original child through them.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is what the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive immune response<\/a> counters: Immune cells specific to a pathogen will proliferate and differentiate both into effector cells to destroy the pathogen, and into memory cells. These can mount a much stronger immune response much faster when they come in contact with the same (or a structurally very similar) pathogen, meaning that a secondary infection normally results in weaker or no symptoms, or at least a quicker regress of the infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reinfection immunity is complicated by evasion mechanisms pathogens have evolved. In viruses the most prominent one is probably high mutation rates of those antigens which tend to be targeted by immune systems. This means that reinfection with the same strain of virus can still trigger an immune response like a completely unknown pathogen. Again, influenza is a great example. The reason why we get flu again winter after winter and why the influenza vaccine is not commonly distributed*, is because this virus tends to mutate over the year with relatively low infection prevalence. Then during the winter, when human immune systems are generally weakened already by the temperature, typically only one or two strains cause epidemics - because we were maybe immune to last year's influenza, but this year's has mutated antigens which our immune system does not recognise yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>*) Influenza vaccine exists. It is developed new every year and is distributed among the population at risk: in the UK for example, people older than 65[if I recall that poster correctly] are encouraged to have the vaccination annually. It is not given to younger people as the vaccination itself causes symptoms, i.e. \"flu\". Younger people would easily resist the actual influenza and hence it is a better bet simply to hope they do not get infected at all. Older people however face a realistic risk of death from the virus and hence the vaccination can save lives.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8320,"question_id":8317,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1368399249}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8317/is-it-possible-for-a-person-to-become-reinfected-with-the-same-strain-of-a-vir","last_activity_date":1368399249,"creation_date":1368393175,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is it possible for a person to become \"reinfected\" with the same strain of a virus?","body":"<p>If a person contracts a virus, viral conjunctivitis for example, is it possible for the individual to become \"reinfected\" with the exact same strain of the virus once the person has it treated and the symptoms have gone away?

We will not be able to print humans any time soon, if ever. Despite the potential of the technology, it will likely still make more sense to use stem cells to fight genetic diseases, create limited cellular masses such as hearts and other organs, and to do reconstructive surgeries such as skeletal repairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reasons vary but will include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The human being is not just a single series of cells, we are a complex melange of integrated systems connected together in a predetermined manner by our genetic code.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The standard 3D printing process might be most effective for producing a single type of cells or a simple organ whose structure is simple and whose configuration could be managed with computer aided design to produce the cells needed at the time of the organ's creation. Even an organ such as a liver will need connective tissues, for blood to be provided for the organ and those cells would need to be integrated as well.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Brain tissue would be the most difficult part of this process. Even having the tissue matrix derived from stem cells would not give us the understanding of how to create an actual brain from a printing process, which uses a layering method to deliver the material into a 3D structure. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It is certain that some things we may do in the future may be done by printing output that resembles cellular matter, i.e. bone repair and restructuring.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In the case of fixed materials such as bone, a 3D model could be taken and then replicated on a printer. The replicated material is then integrated into an area of the body and allowed to either grow in place or artificially stimulated to grow to replace the damaged area. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I use bones as an example since they have very limited purposes and once replicated artificially, would be relatively easy to put in place. This would certainly transform the dental industry, perhaps hip replacement surgeries. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If the technology could be applied internally to damaged tissues, perhaps spinal injuries could be repaired and with proper rehabilitation, a person who may have lost mobility due to an injury could have nervous tissue regrown and learn to walk again. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The potential for specific cellular development is outstanding but the method for growing complete humans has had millions of years evolution and not likely to be surpassed by Humanity in the next thirty to one hundred years unless we come to a far greater understanding of the human genome and the genetic/cellular relationships between systems in the human body as a collective whole.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8311,"question_id":8307,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3698349ad0b898d398a6573f4d1f867a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":696,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/696/rex-kerr","reputation":261,"display_name":"Rex Kerr"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1368387316,"creation_date":1368387316,"body":"<p>No.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason is that development is extremely important for getting tissue organized on the appropriate scale.

Focusing requires all the rays from a source to end up at the same point on the retina/film, the aperture, when it is as small as possible \"selects\" only those rays that will end up focusing at exactly the right place (assuming the lens focuses to the right place, which it does not in the case of the short or long sighted). This selection cuts out a lot of the light, and often it is good to trade off the ability to focus for the amount of light.

When one stops thinking about a gene (and its protein products) as something that was designed to fulfill a specific purpose, but rather as something that has been adapted (often serendipitously), for better and for worse, to fulfill a particular set of functions, the difficulty with annotating gene function is a lot clearer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, this idea is confounded by the fact that <strong>reliable functional annotations are <em>really, really rare<\/em><\/strong>. Sure, lots of genes in human and yeast and <em>Drosophila<\/em> have been extensively studied for decades, and many of their functions are well understood (at least we think they are). But for the vast majority of genes for the vast majority of organisms that have been studied, functional annotations are inferred from sequence similarity to previously annotated genes, without any additional experimental validation. Of course, every genome project would love to functionally classify all of the genes for their pet genome, but this is really expensive, time consuming, and low-throughput. For every extensively studied, well annotated gene, there are literally hundreds of analogous genes in other organisms that have been annotated solely based on sequence similarity to this gene. As disappointing as this is, it doesn't seem like it's going to change any time in the near future (unless there are some drastic improvements in the throughput of gene function annotation).

Bacteria, fungi and parasites are all living organisms, alive in the traditional sense. It is, therefore, possible to design drugs that kill them. <\/p>\n\n<p>Viruses are trickier, while <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=are-viruses-alive-2004&amp;page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">not really alive<\/a> in the traditional sense, they still have to make copies of their genetic material (DNA, or RNA in the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">many viruses<\/a>) in order to cause infection. Therefore, drugs like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganciclovir\" rel=\"nofollow\">ganciclovir<\/a> that stop the formation of viral DNA can be an effective treatment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prion based diseases such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mad Cow disease<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_%28disease%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kuru<\/a>, are not caused by a classical infectious agent but by a simple protein, a prion. Prions are misfolded versions of proteins already present in the host's body. When a prion interacts with the host protein, it causes this protein to adopt the same, misfolded, state as the prion. Protein function depends directly on the protein's structure, the way it is folded in three dimensional space. Therefore, the misfolded protein can no longer carry out its physiological role and disease symptoms occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, since the prion is just a protein, one single molecule, there is no essential life process that we can disrupt. We have to attack them using chemical agents that target the prion while not affecting the healthy, correctly folded, host protein.

That is to say all their cells divide forever - there is no senescence (planned cell death) in any of their cells. Interestingly Hydrae that reproduce sexually age and die, but asexual reproduction appear to be immortal.  Animals that are immortal more often reproduce asexually... this may only be because immortality became unpopular in evolution early on and may have not developed senescence in the way other animals have, or lost it when it was not so integral to life.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306686/\">Although immortal Hydra also appears to share the (TTAGGG)n telomere repeat, there is as yet no data on how or whether they avoid chromosome end depletion. These data suggest the possibility that senescence or death of asexual individuals and colonies may in part result from a failure to maintain chromosome ends that are restored by going through a sexually reproductive cycle .<\/a> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So its not clear if the telomeres are protected in hydrae and other immortal animals.  I would guess they probably don't have active telomerase if they are truly immortal, though its possible the telomeres are shortened and are repaired.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are other factors which are supposed to be important for immortality.  Yeast and single eukaryotes are not individually immortal; an individual mother cell can only divide a limited number of times. While hydrae are not a popular focus of research, there has been a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2536486/\">concerted effort in trying to understand yeast mortality<\/a> and there are more than one mechanism being pointed to. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since there is no germline in single celled organisms, (they only have one copy of their genome to reproduce from) telomeric shortening would not be a useful mechanism for aging; Calorie restriction has been shown to prolong fission and budding yeast by activating pathways which slow aging by protecting against stress, and slowing down reproduction.  All of these findings have strong parallels in work in aging in animals which is a hot topic now.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Finding these pathways is encouraging strong thought that aging and senescence are an evolutionary adaptation rather than a biological necessity. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our current knowledge suggests that an apoptotic program has evolved in microorganisms as a survival strategy beneficial to the group. This program is dependent on cellular pathways like the Sch9, Tor1, and Ras/PKA pathways and its activation reduces cell protection and maintenance and raises the level of superoxide production, which in turn contributes to cell damage and death. Superoxide also elevates DNA damage and mutation frequency in the aging cultures ... Aging and apoptosis are intrinsically related in yeast and the mechanisms that cause them have just begun to be elucidated. ...  will provide important information to understand the fundamental biology of aging in other species and investigate the controversial hypothesis that an \u201caging program\u201d might be conserved in higher eukaryotes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is an open question as to whether an immortal yeast could be <em>engineered<\/em> to be immortal.  A team at Max Planck Institute did a lot of foot work and found a strain which they claim <a href=\"http://dalje.com/en-lifestyle/finding-immortality-is-a-challenge-for-me/263225\">does not seem to experience individual mortality either<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>So this does indicates that immortality might not be a necessity for any cell or maybe even for animals.  Occasionally, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit\">even animal and human cells can be coaxed to revert to an immortalized state<\/a>, though usually it is the result of <a href=\"http://actu.epfl.ch/news/demystifying-the-immortality-of-cancer-cells/\">cancerous rearrangements of the genome<\/a>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a rich field and there are lots of <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/animals/immortal-animals-reveal-anti-aging-secrets-110421.htm\">telomerase focused ideas too<\/a>.

This circumvents a lot of the issues above (theoretically, but I'm not an expert on hydras). Many copies of the DNA are separately housed, so if a copy gets damaged irreversibly, it can just get trashed. Most (if not all) human organs have similar reserves of active stem cells. There isn't a single universal source (outside of the sperm and eggs), but this is less important so long as the entire stem cell supply isn't compromised by some gross organ damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second part is much, much harder for humans though. While some tissues (say muscle) can easily replace dead cells, it's much harder in others, like the brain. You don't just have to replace a dead cell, but all of its connections to every other cell. And really, the brain is what this all comes down to, and an identity crisis in humans.  I don't care if you replace my liver and my left arm times, but how do you replace the brain?

Only mutations that occurred when we were in the early stages of development will affect all cells. That's why pregnant mothers shouldn't smoke. The reason for this is that one cell goes on to divide and become all our cells so any mutations in that cell are passed on to cells formed when it divides. That same principle explains your smoker example. In the lung we have two types of cells which are called Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 cells are constantly dying as they get old and they get replaced by type 2 cells whose job it is to divide continuously to replace Type 1 cells. So we have lots of type 1 and few type 2. When type 2 divide they make one type 1 cell and one type 2 cell, so type 2 cells never run out. If smoke causes a mutation in type 1 cells generally they're okay because they'll die before enough mutations occur. Of course something that causes lots of mutations could make it cancerous before it dies but that's rare. Now if it occurs in Type 2 cells every subsequent type 1 or type 2 cell that cell makes is mutated. <\/p>\n\n<p>The last thing you mentioned are mutations that occur to eggs and sperm. When making sperm you have the same as above. One cell makes sperm and a sperm maker cell. The sperm is like type 1 cells and the sperm maker cell is like type 2. So mutations affect them as they do above, where a mutation in a sperm maker cell is way worse. As for eggs women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have and there's no egg maker cells. So mutations just occur, and the older women are the more mutations. That's why the older a mother is the much higher risk of genetic diseases like downs. But an older man only has a slight increase in risk. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations that affect eggs and sperm tend to be really harmful, as they affect every cell, so these cells or \"babies\" die before the mother even realises she's pregnant or as a miscarriage.

This negative feedback\n  mechanism gives a 24-hour rhythm in the expression of the clock genes.\n  Many genes are suspected to be linked to circadian control by \"E-box\n  elements\" in their promoters, as CLK-CYC and its homologs bind to\n  these elements.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The 24-hr rhythm could be reset by light via the protein cryptochrome\n  (CRY), which is involved in the circadian photoreception in\n  Drosophila. CRY associates with TIM in a light-dependent manner that\n  leads to the destruction of TIM. Without the presence of TIM for\n  stabilization, PER is eventually destroyed during the day. As a\n  result, the repression of CLK-CYC is reduced and the whole cycle\n  reinitiates again. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus#Fruitfly\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus#Fruitfly<\/a>)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a tiny part of our brain residing in the center. It maintains a biological clock through a gene expression cycle in the individual neurons. The mechanism for humans is very similar to the mechanism for fruit flies, as explained above, but to rehash a bit...<\/p>\n\n<p>In the fruit fly model there are five players: CLK, CYC, PER, TIM, CRY.<\/p>\n\n<p>CLK and CYC are transcription factors for PER and TIM, and bind to their promoters in order to activate the expression of PER and TIM.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the expression level of PER and TIM gets very high, the PER and TIM proteins return to the nucleus, and inhibit their own transcription factors (CLK and CYC) through molecular interactions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CRY protein is light-sensitive, and so daylight (or artificial light) will cause CRY to destroy the TIM proteins. Without TIM, we no longer get the PER-TIM dimers that inhibit the CLK-CYC transcription factors.<\/p>\n\n<p>In humans and other mammals it's the same concept, but with slightly different players (e.g., homologous genes).<\/p>\n\n<p>What's important here is that we have a biological clock on the cellular level. We haven't gone into how this clock is used yet... But, it's my understanding that the SCN uses the information to tell the pineal gland when to produce melatonin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The melatonin causes us to be drowsy, lowers our body temperatures, and causes us to fall asleep.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see another cycle at work here - our body temperature, which rises with wakefulness, and declines with sleep. <\/p>\n\n<p>This gives a more general answer to how circadian rhythms are used to influence our sleep cycle. Your question was how the genes involved in circadian rhythms regulate each other. The answer is the transcription-translation negative feedback loop described above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps...<\/p>\n","answer_id":8143,"question_id":8137,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1367296220}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8137/what-is-the-mechanism-of-regulation-of-per-cry-genes","last_activity_date":1367296220,"creation_date":1367239373,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the mechanism of regulation of PER /CRY genes?","body":"<p>I've read multiple descriptions of biological/circadian clocks and they all mention PER, CRY and CLOCK genes.

The frequency of infection varies throughout the day, with a peak in early morning and late evening.<\/p>\n\n<p>A recent study conducted by Ivan Norscia and Elisabetta Palagi (University of Pisa) has provided the first evidence that the behavioral contagion of yawning is associated with the empathic bond between people. The study showed that the infection follows the same gradient of empathy: is greatest in close relatives (parents / children / grandchildren, brothers, stable couples), decreases in friends, then acquaintances in (people connected only by a third, external, ie work or a friend in common) and reaches a minimum in the unknown.<\/p>\n\n<p>Various studies of clinical, psychological and neurobiological suggest and support the link between the yawn contagion and empathy. For example, the infection begins to occur at 4-5 years of age, when children develop the ability to identify, in a proper way, the emotions of others. In addition, the infection is reduced or absent in people who have problems related to empathy, how people with autism, and is positively related to subjective scores of empathy based on tests of psychological type. Finally, the areas of the brain related to the emotional sphere overlap, in part, with those involved in the response to yawn, with a possible involvement of mirror neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yawning has been observed among various primates. In these cases the yawn is a threat gesture, a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. Specific studies were conducted on chimpanzees and stumptail macaques. A group of these animals was shown a video of other conspecifics yawning; both species yawned as well. This helps to partly confirm a yawn's \"contagiousness\".<\/p>\n\n<p>In animals, yawning can serve as a warning signal. For example, Charles Darwin, in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, mentioned that baboons yawn to threaten their enemies, possibly by displaying large canine teeth.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawn\" rel=\"nofollow\">see yawn<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder\" rel=\"nofollow\">autism<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Gordon Gallup, who hypothesizes that yawning may be a means of keeping the brain cool, <strong>also hypothesizes that \"contagious\" yawning may be a survival instinct inherited from our evolutionary past<\/strong>. \"During human evolutionary history, when we were subject to predation and attacks by other groups, <strong>if everybody yawns in response to seeing someone yawn the whole group becomes much more vigilant and much better at being able to detect danger.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, I can make an observation. Cats yawn as specific means to calm people, and especially to reassure the other cats and the pups. In order, they stretch, yawn, lie down, half close theyr eyes as if they start to sleep. When the whole group repeats the gestures, the majority of them (now calm) actually falls asleep.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong> @kmm<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028472\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norscia &amp; Palagi<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The Pisa Group in cooperation with CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche =\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111212092649.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friends and loved ones yawn together - Science Daily<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~fdolins/berenty/scientists/pisa_grp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Pisa Group/ Elisabetta Palagi, Ivan Norscia, and Daniela Antonacci - University of Michigan - Dearborny<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Gallup\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gordon G.

All that is required is flexibility. Once hair gets long enough, it collides with itself, and is pushed off to one side or another, forming a chiral curl. <\/p>\n\n<p>For some anecdotal evidence against microscopic chirality, find someone with large diameter hanging curls in their hair. Those seem to often curl straight back on to themselves. A more compelling anecdote is that curled objects, including hair and telephone cords (if anyone still remembers those) can be pulled through themselves and chirally inverted. Sometimes there will be some resistance, but that could be the keratin or plastic or whatever having set in its shape over time, rather than being preferentially formed that way.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are obviously both anecdotal though, and the idea that there is some slight chiral preference isn't ruled out. I'm not even opposed to the fundamental idea of transitive chirality through several orders of superhelicity (look at DNA), but it just hasn't been my empirical experience. As Ryan points out, if it were a strong effect, all hair would curl the same way, and straight hair wouldn't exist at all.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just to provide a bit of data, this paper demonstrates that hair curvature is based on the distribution of 4 different cell types in a follicle. The keratin (and many other proteins associated with) intermediate fibrils were associated with curvature, but only to the extend that their compositions were different in the 4 cell types. But the curvature was based on the distribution of the cells themselves.  Chirality wasn't specifically studied in the paper, but I think (given that they were staring at individual fibers with an electron microscope) that they would have noticed it had it existed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cortical cell types and intermediate filament arrangements correlate with fiber curvature in Japanese human hair\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847708002980\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847708002980<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Naturally straight and curved human scalp hairs were examined using fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques to determine morphological and ultrastructural features contributing to single fiber curvature. The study excluded cuticle and medulla, which lack known bilateral structural asymmetry and therefore potential to form curved fibers. The cortex contained four classifiable cell types, two of which were always present in much greater abundance than the remaining two types. In straight hair, these cell types were arranged annularly and evenly within the cortex, implying that the averaging of differing structural features would maintain a straight fiber conformation. In curved fibers, the cell types were bilaterally distributed approximately perpendicular to fiber curvature direction with one dominant cell type predominantly located closest to the convex fiber side and the other, closest to the concave side. Electron tomography confirmed that the dominant cell type closest to the convex fiber side contained discrete macrofibrils composed of helically arranged intermediate filaments, while the dominant cell type closest to the concave side contained larger fused macrofibrils composed of intermediate filament arrangements varying from helical to hexagonal arrays approximately parallel to the longitudinal fiber axis.

This accounts for about 10-20% of the total file size.  Also many PDBs have ANISOU records, but they're about as redundant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, even if you're dealing with raw coordinate data, I think you're underestimating just how well GZIP already does.  Let's just say half that column data is somehow completely redundant and we can just compress it all away. Next we'll encode the 5 numbers (x, y, z, q, b) in binary using 2 bytes for each number (which isn't even enough room for practical use, but we're optimistic here).  So we've compressed 80 columns to 10 columns, which is 12.5% of the original size. Running gzip on a couple simple pdbs (after grepping out just the ATOM records), it achieves 23.0% of the original size. If we really cared about file size, we could use bzip2 which gets to 16.4%.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Our magical compression tool is only twice as good as gzip, which is nice, but gzip is already four times better than uncompressed pdbs.  If we cared enough, we'd just use bzip2, which is only 30% larger than this hypothetical minimum size. And once we got all the atom specifications back in there, I'm sure they'd be virtually identical.  The bottom line is that bzip2 is already very close to the maximal theoretical compression limit for many kinds of files, especially text files. For genome sequencing data, which is orders of magnitude larger and more redundant, people just made slight modifications of the underlying algorithm. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've downloaded and analyzed the entire PDB database (a little out of date, but it's 75K structures and 14GB, gzip compressed), and can appreciate wanting to shrink it down further, believe me.  At that level, compression makes a difference in analysis time just reading data off the hard disk (or an NFS server). Fortunately, many (if not most) pdb tools read gzip'd pdbs natively (sadly not the case for bzip'd files). Perl, Python, and every other major bioinformatics language have simple APIs for automatically decompressing gzip'd files as they're opened. Against the ubiquity of gzip, it's not really worth thinking about a small improvement in compression. Again, if we cared, we'd just make everything use bzip2 instead. <\/p>\n\n<p>The future is more like PDBML, which I kind of despise.  But it's far more complete and easier to parse (given that XML parsers exist for every major language), even if the files themselves are an order of magnitude larger. I don't like them (and mostly XML in general) because they're not human readable in any practical sense. But at the same time I'm not suggesting we just move to a 120 column PDB format just to address PDB format limitations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Using only dihedral angles would never work either, and not because of numerical precision. There is small but significant variance in bond lengths and angles that would cause coordinates to be off by angstroms by the end of the chain.  It wouldn't help with ANISOU, REMARK, and other records. And it would frankly be a huge pain to write new parsers for. <\/p>\n","answer_id":8103,"question_id":1795,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/compressing-structural-information-in-pdb-files","last_activity_date":1367045402,"creation_date":1334291989,"answer_count":3,"title":"Compressing structural information in PDB files","body":"<p>There seems to be a lot of redundancy in PDB files.

For reference, the format of ATOM records in PDB files is defined at wwpdb.org/documentation/format33/sect9.html#ATOM.<\/p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the data in the above excerpt seems redundant.  The first field (ATOM), second field (atom index, e.g. 332 in the first row), sixth field (residue index, e.g. 42), tenth field (occupancy, e.g. 1.00) and last field (element name, e.g. N) seem clearly extraneous.  The fourth field (residue name) could be shortened from three characters to 1 character, or simply an integer.  I'm not a data compression expert, but I imagine gzip picks up most of this redundancy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Slightly less obviously, the atom names for each residue also seem unnecessary.  To my understanding, the atomic composition of all residues' backbones will always be the same, and represented in PDB files as \"N\", \"CA\", \"C\", \"O\".  The same for the atomic composition of the residues' respective sidechains: a lysine sidechain will always be \"CB\", \"CG\", \"CD\", \"CE\", \"NZ\" and a phenylalanine sidechain will always be \"CB\", \"CG\", \"CD1\", \"CD2\", \"CE1\", \"CE2\", \"CZ\".  <\/p>\n\n<p>A subtler redundancy, but one that might increase compressibility a lot, seems like it could be in the atomic coordinates themselves.  For example, in the backbone, would it be possible to deduce each residue atom's X, Y and Z coordinates (12 data points: 4 atoms * 3 coordinates) given only their phi, psi and omega <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dihedral_angle&amp;oldid=474965018#Dihedral_angles_of_biological_molecules\" rel=\"nofollow\">dihedral angles<\/a> (3 data points)?  Could applying dihedral angles to atoms within sidechains similarly remove the need to explicitly list the 3D coordinates there?<\/p>\n\n<p>Could \"temperature  factor\" (the second to last field in the excerpt) be losslessly removed, or compressed in some non-obvious way?  What are some other possible optimizations that could be used to more efficiently compress PDB files?  Are there any obvious grave performance implications of these various compression techniques on the speed of a hypothetical decompressor to convert back to the official PDB format?  Have these questions been answered in the literature or an existing PDB-specific compression program?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any answers or feedback.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<p>Given that no PDB-specific file compressors seem to be available, I suppose my specific goal is to develop one.  One potential application I see for this is in significantly decreasing fresh times-to-render in certain use cases of browser-based molecular visualization programs, e.g. <a href=\"http://jmol.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jmol<\/a>, <a href=\"http://web.chemdoodle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ChemDoodle Web Components<\/a> or <a href=\"http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp/glmol/viewer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">GLmol<\/a>.  Another application could be decreasing the time and size of data needed to download archives of PDB files like those described <a href=\"http://www.wwpdb.org/downloads.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This would of course require a way to efficiently decompress the packed PDB files, but this trade-off between decompression time and download time seems like it could be useful in at least some niche applications.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<p>In a comment, nico asks \"How would compressing the file decrease render time?\".  Decreasing gzipped PDB file size (e.g. by half or more) and thus decreasing time needed to download the file would decrease the time between when the PDB file was requested from a remote server and when the structure was rendered by a molecular visualization program running on a client machine. Apologies if that use of \"fresh time-to-render\" in that context was unclear.<\/p>\n\n<p>A lossless compression could also involve encoding the PDB file to an object (e.g. JSON) that is faster to parse for the visualization program, and decrease render times that way.  Looking around further, if the application only required displaying the 3D structure and not also retaining data about specific atoms and residues, then using a binary mesh compression (e.g. <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/webgl-loader/\" rel=\"nofollow\">webgl-loader<\/a>) seems like it would probably decrease time-to-render even more.<\/p>\n","question_id":1795,"tags":["bioinformatics","pdb","3d-structure","visualization"],"score":6,"accepted_answer_id":1797,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":386,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1334429637},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GY9jW.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3450,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3450/bombyx-mori","reputation":111,"display_name":"Bombyx mori"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9XAi.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1668,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1668/domagoj","reputation":131,"display_name":"Domagoj"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GY9jW.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3450,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3450/bombyx-mori","reputation":111,"display_name":"Bombyx mori"},"score":0,"post_id":8095,"edited":false,"creation_date":1367123638,"comment_id":10257,"body":"While this helps, it does not answer my question.

The same holds for rats and other denizens of sewers. Sewers are a very nutrient rich environment, and as in many nutrient rich environments, a few species tend to possess the right traits (whatever those may be) to survive and out-compete other species. To take an example from coral reefs, when coral reefs suffer from eutrophication, this leads to a growth in phytoplankton and a reduction of the euphotic zone that can lead to the death of all but the most resistant corals. Likewise in the terrestrial environment, only the most tolerant or opportunistic species tend to survive in highly perturbed and nutrient rich environments like sewers. With respect to cockroaches getting cancer, I've never read anything about insect cancer, but I imagine in theory that they could get cancer.

It is rare but hardly\n  unique. The odds of two such persons randomly meeting each other and\n  mating are probably pretty low. Depending upon each partner's exact\n  karotype there may be no difficulty producing healthy offspring with\n  unusual chromosome complements.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\"If they will have make a new species, let's breed them!!
