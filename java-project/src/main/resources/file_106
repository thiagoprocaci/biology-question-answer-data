A small fraction of bacterial species are known to be naturally competent, meaning that they can engage in this sort of horizontal gene transfer in their natural environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, naturally competent bacteria carry genes that encode the machinery necessary to facilitate the transport of this DNA across the membrane and into the cell. The exogenous DNA binds to a receptor located on the surface of competent cells, gets fragmented into small pieces, and then one strand is degraded while the other strand is transported across the membrane into the cytoplasm with the aid of a DNA translocase enzyme. Ultimately, assuming a sufficient degree of homology, it incorporates into the host genome via recombination.<\/p>\n\n<p>During this process, however, the DNA has to be protected from degradative nucleases. I remember reading something about a transformation-specific DNA binding protein that coats the entire length of the DNA strand and prevents degradation. Is it the same translocase enzyme that facilitates movement across the membrane that is responsible for this? Or is there another protein involved?<\/p>\n\n<p>And then, regardless of which protein is responsible in the case of natural competence, how does that protein get expressed and activated in the case of artificial competence? When we induce competence in the laboratory through one of various methods (e.g., electroporation), the DNA is essentially forced into the cell through openings in the membrane, so no transferase protein is needed. What signals the bacterium, then, to express the protective binding protein? What keeps the exogenous DNA from being readily degraded by endogenous nucleases? Whatever signals induced the expression of this protein in the case of natural competence would seem to be absent when competence is induced artificially, and it doesn't make any sense that the bacterium would constitutively express such a protein.<\/p>\n","question_id":7887,"tags":["genetics","microbiology","bacteriology","molecular-genetics","transformation"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":765,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0syJT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1813,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1813/brenton-horne","reputation":1198,"display_name":"Brenton Horne","accept_rate":32},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":8155,"edited":false,"creation_date":1367297467,"comment_id":10312,"body":"check the units.. may be a μM to nM conversion problem.. verify"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0syJT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1813,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1813/brenton-horne","reputation":1198,"display_name":"Brenton Horne","accept_rate":32},"score":0,"post_id":8155,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1367298899,"comment_id":10313,"body":"Nope, all the units are nM."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":8155,"edited":false,"creation_date":1367311859,"comment_id":10320,"body":"it would be better if you can save this page as a document or pdf and put it in dropbox.

These autophagosomes are then transported to, and merge with, lysosomes, releasing the cargo into the lysosome to be degraded. The broken down materials are then released back into the cytosol, where other processes can make use of them. That is the \"some kind of recycling\" you are referring to.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two types of autophagy - selective and general. In selective autophagy, receptors on the membrane of the autophagosome specifically selects for ligands (e.g. p62, ndp52 selects for ubiquinylated substrates, which usually marks molecules for degradation). In general autophagy, the uptake into the autophagosome is random.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you can think of general autophagy as maintaining a basic level of turnover - to ensure everything in the cell is not worn out; and selective autophagy as a response to specific ligands that needs to be degraded.<\/p>\n\n<p>By this logic, autophagy activity increases during infection because those infectious agents, once gaining entry into the cell (either through phagocytosis or by forced entry), will need the autophagy machinery to transport it to the lysosome to be degraded.

Take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance#Lactase_persistence\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lactase Persistence<\/a> as a widely studied example in humans. The majority of the world is lactose intolerant after they stop drinking their mother's milk, but a single point mutation results in the ability to consume dairy products into adulthood. It does not make people who are lactose tolerant a new <em>species<\/em>, but it does open up a potential new nutrient source, which benefits the people who have it and thus it was passed down successfully over other variations.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to that example, the definition of \"Species\" is <strong>NOT<\/strong> exactly defined. There are many variations, including (but not limited to):<\/p>\n\n<p>1) A group of organisms that cannot interbreed <em>in the wild<\/em>.<br>\n2) A group of organisms with significantly different phenotypes (appearances).<br>\n3) A group of organisms with sufficient* genetic divergence.  <\/p>\n\n<p>*There is absolutely <em>no<\/em> scientific consensus on how much genetic divergence is necessary to create a new species. We share >95% of our genetics with Chimpanzees, so it's not much - it could be as little as a few key genes out of the entire genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>So where you define the boundaries of species is up for grabs to some extent, but the most <em>common<\/em> is what you delineated - when a member of one group cannot interbreed with another group.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wouldn't there have to be a male and female with the same genetic divergence at the same time to make a new species?  What is the popularly accepted mechanism for the splitting into a new species in organisms that require sexual reproduction?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Nope. Assuming everything necessary for the gametes to produce fertile offspring is present (aka - the chromosomes aren't significantly altered and the gametes are compatible) then a new species emerges through successive generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>One mother or father gives their mutation to their children, which pass it on to their children, which pass it on to their children, etc. If the mutation is significantly advantageous it will allow the children with the mutation to better survive in the environment, and over time it could become the dominant phenotype that could lead to the creation of a new species as further mutations build in the new group - further differing the generations of the mother/father from the original group the mother/father were born into. Good examples are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_accelerated_regions\" rel=\"nofollow\">HAR - Human Accelerated Regions<\/a> which are sets of genes that are pretty much the same throughout all other vertebrates, but startlingly different in humans. The HAR did not <em>create<\/em> humans, but it's thought the mutations contributed greatly to our intelligence - which allowed <em>other<\/em> mutations to be taken advantage of (like the humble opposable thumb) as our lifestyle changed due to the increased intelligence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not all mutations need to be advantageous, though. There's lots of fuzzy areas. If a mutation isn't beneficial, but also isn't that detrimental, it can also stick around in a population. These mutations might not lead to the creation of new species, but can certainly contribute to genetic divergence.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8644,"question_id":8640,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1370524845,"creation_date":1370519342,"body":"<p>It should also be added that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">allopatric speciation<\/a> is arguably the most common form of speciation (compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric_speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">sympatric speciation<\/a>).

Two hypotheses based on asymmetric inheritance of sex chromosomes (\u201cunguarded X\u201d) or mitochondrial genomes (\u201cmother's curse\u201d) explain sex differences in lifespan as sex-specific maladaptation leading to increased mortality in the shorter-lived sex. While asymmetric inheritance hypotheses equate long life with high fitness, considerable empirical evidence suggests that sexes resolve the fundamental tradeoff between reproduction and survival differently resulting in sex-specific optima for lifespan. However, selection for sex-specific values in life-history traits is constrained by intersexual genetic correlations resulting in intra-locus sexual conflict over optimal lifespan. The available data suggest that the evolution of sexual dimorphism only partially resolves these conflicts. Sexual conflict over optimal trait values, which has been demonstrated in model organisms and in humans, is likely to play a key role in shaping the evolution of lifespan, as well as in maintaining genetic variation for sex-specific diseases.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3716,"question_id":3566,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1370514851},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1348867111,"creation_date":1348867111,"body":"<p>The testosterone effect mentioned by @rwst is an exciting new discovery, but there may be a deeper answer which is an evolutionary adaptation.

Grandfather's probably don't enjoy this benefit as much because they are thought to contribute less to the offspring.

In the rational world of evolutionary biology, children love their parents for the same sort of reason - the parents give them resources to gather their strength and develop as adults so they can have their own children with the most advantage that they possibly can.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Humans are off the charts in the amount of resources we invest in our children - our lives are 1/4 to 1/3 over before we sometimes leave our parents household (in some societies of course they never leave the house, but step into an extended family).  This may be one of the reasons we are so successful as a species - we live in practically every place we possibly could and have no danger of competition from any other living thing excepting ourselves.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The grandmother effect is essentially the idea that if women, who are more attached to the offspring in more cases than fathers, continue to live and help support the grandchildren and make them more successful, then this will allow post menopausal women to have a longer lifespan (which they do). <\/p>\n\n<p>The evolutionary biologist Sara Hrdy, emeritus UC Davis, has written quite a bit about the nuances of the evolution of the role of motherhood - reading some of <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends\" rel=\"nofollow\">her articles<\/a> or <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0345408934\" rel=\"nofollow\">books<\/a> might give you a deeper sense of how profoundly filial love has shaped human beings. <\/p>\n\n<p>--- more answer this stuff may or may not be worth reading depending on how broadly you want to understand this question...<\/p>\n\n<p>Its important to say that many of the expansions of human average human lifespan have not been genetic.  Its commonly cited that sewer systems, clean water, antibiotics and plentiful food are the three most important factors in human lifespan - and before modern developed world nations, the average lifespan of human beings was somewhere in the 30s.  And there are significant lifespan differences in regions where these factors and others (education of women, access to prenatal and early care etc) are available.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Studies continue to be published that examine environmental and lifestyle factors compared to genetics and it seems that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/magazine/the-island-where-people-forget-to-die.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">environment and lifestyle can make an astounding difference<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But genetics undoubtedly has a role to play here too.  <a href=\"http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030125\" rel=\"nofollow\">There are probably some individual humans and animals which have evolved to live longer<\/a>.  This has been found to be genetically related in some humans by demographics and family lines.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Still there are genetic factors that are being identified.  I think its a common misconception that evolution changes the entire species, but its not really true.  There are some who have that tendency and others who do not - at times there will be more of say shorter lived people and other times longer lived individuals will be more common.  It depends upon whether the living conditions of the population really favor one tendency over another.

The basis of spectrophotometry is that light passes through a sample, and less light emerges than the amount which entered. The amount of light that has \"disappeared\" is used to deduce something about the solution in the cuvette. Light can be absorbed by chemical groups (this is the basis for e.g. DNA having an absorbance value) or it can be scattered by particulate material (this is the basis for measuring the cell density of a bacterial culture). If you are trying to make a measurement of the first type (absorbance) and you get a precipitate your reading will be distorted by the light scattering effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Precipitates are incompatible with spectrophotometry.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the comments have noted: if you give more details of your protocol someone may be able to help.

This question can then be read as:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the process in which a cell population is targeted and implanted with a gene of interest?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many ways, which depend on the specific cell type and on whether you want to do it <em>in vitro<\/em>, <em>in vivo<\/em> and in which species, and it would be very complex to explain them all in detail here, so I will limit myself to two approaches that are popular when doing optogenetics in rodents: viral infection and transgenesis.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Viral infection<\/strong> uses an inactivated virus to deliver the transgene. Essentially you engineer a piece of DNA with the gene for the bacterial opsin of interest and you put it in a <em>viral envelope<\/em>, that is a series of proteins that form the \"body\" of the virus and that contain its genetic material.<br>\nYou then inject the virus in the desired zone (e.g. in a specific brain nucleus) and wait for it to infect the cells around the injection site. A week later those cells will express the transgene. <\/p>\n\n<p>For (at least, I think) historical reasons the first type of viruses used for this approach were lentiviruses. These, however, are a tad more complex to handle (especially as they require specialised rooms where they can be handled safely) so adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are becoming more and more popular.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the virus is inactivated, that is, it cannot replicate, just infect the cells around the infection site, but it will not be able to spread around. This is both for safety reasons and because you want the infection to be confined to the specific region where you injected the virus.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I was saying before, instead of putting a bacterial opsin you can put whatever gene of interest, the procedure is the same. As for the opsins, the first two that were used were the channelrhodopsin-2 (<em>ChR2<\/em>), a channel sensitive to blue light and that can be used to depolarize (=excite) the cells and the halorhodopsin (<em>NpHR<\/em>), a chloride pump sensitive to yellow light that will, conversely, hyperpolarize (=inhibit) the cells.<br>\nThere are nowadays tens of variants of these and other opsins that can be used to drive cell activity with lights. Many of these are described in this (beware! Quite technical) review:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21745635\" rel=\"nofollow\">Optogenetics in neural systems<\/a> - Yizhar et al., Neuron 2011<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Transgenesis<\/strong> works instead by generating an animal that carries the opsin (or any other gene) in its DNA. This can be done in various way, such as by microinjection of embryonic stem cells carrying the transgene.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can find a fairly detailed explanation of the process here: <a href=\"http://9e.devbio.com/article.php?id=290&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=1198&amp;vpy=115&amp;dur=615&amp;hovh=245&amp;hovw=205&amp;tx=184&amp;ty=108&amp;ei=zjirUebAJ46BhQf4qoC4Ag&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=137&amp;tbnw=115&amp;start=25&amp;ndsp=32&amp;ved=1t:429,r:32,s:0,i:186\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transgenic Cells and Gene Knock-outs<\/a>, well summed up by this figure (taken by the same page):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://9e.devbio.com/images/ch02/wt020302-2.jpg\" alt=\"Transgenic mice generation\"><\/p>\n\n<p>But how do you get <strong>cell-type selectivity<\/strong>?<br>\nIn front of the gene for the opsin you also will have to put another sequence, called promoter. The promoter is a sequence that is specific to each gene and that is used to determine which genes a cell will or will not transcribe. For instance, the promoter for the gene coding for a protein only present in muscles will be used by muscle cells but not by neurons. You can even get more specific, for instance by using promoters that are typical of a subset of cells and not other (e.g. glutamatergic neurons use a different set of promoters than GABAergic neurons, although these two sets will -at least in part- overlap). However, this means that if you want to change the cell type you are working on you will have to change the DNA vector you are using.<br>\nA commonly used approach to avoid this is that of using <strong>Cre-dependent vectors<\/strong> (note that this can be used both for viral infections or for transgenic animals).<br>\nEssentially you will have a mouse line which expresses a protein derived from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P1_phage\" rel=\"nofollow\">P1 phage<\/a>, called <strong>Cre recombinase<\/strong>, only in the cell type of interest (again, using a specific promoter). Cre has the property of cutting DNA next to specific 34 base-pair-long sequences called <strong>loxP<\/strong> (with sequence <code>ATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT<\/code>). Essentially, if you have <code>loxP-[some sequence in the middle]-loxP<\/code> and Cre recombinase is around, it will cut away the sequence in the middle, leaving only a loxP sequence.<br>\nHundreds of different Cre-expressing mouse lines are commercially available nowadays, to target many different cell types in different organs.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, you just need a construct that allows you to express the opsin in a Cre-dependent manner. This is what was done by the group of Hongkui Zeng, and reported in this paper:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446880\" rel=\"nofollow\">A toolbox of Cre-dependent optogenetic transgenic mice for light-induced activation and silencing.<\/a> - Madisen et al., Nat.

Males are said to be heterogametic. In Drosophila there is also an XY system, with heterogametic males, but in this case what determines sex is the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. This ratio exerts its effects through the Sxl gene. In this system the Y chromosome does not carry male-determining genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>In flowering plants, in dioecious species, the usual situation is that males are heterogametic. However, there is variability in the underlying mechanism of sex determination.  So for example in hop (<em>Humulus lupulus<\/em>) there is a pair of sex chromosomes that can be distinguished by their appearance. However there is no active male determination but rather the X to autosomal ratio determines sex (as in Drosophila). Conversely, in asparagus (<em>Asparagus officinalis<\/em>), sex is determined by a pair of chromosomes designated pair 5. The two chromosomes are morphologically indistinguishable but genetic evidence indicates that there is active sex determination in this species - one member of pair 5 acts like the mammalian Y chromosome.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8603,"question_id":8601,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1370027514}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8601/how-do-fully-dioecious-plants-determine-sex","last_activity_date":1370027514,"creation_date":1369982787,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do fully dioecious plants determine sex?","body":"<p>I know that a minority of plants are fully dioecious, with adult plants producing either only male or only female flowers.

Quorum sensing is a signalling pathway in bacteria which senses a molecule that the bacteria themselves secrete.  When the concentration of the quorum signal reaches a certain level, the bacteria interpret this as their population density reaching some threshhold.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Bacteria are always around - even infectious Staph, as described in the other answer, the bacteria are always being cleared out by the immune system, but when they find the right place where they can get critical mass, they dig in, form a biofilm and secrete toxins, which can help them divide more successfully.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a description of the process from a <a href=\"http://www.jci.org/articles/view/20442\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper on Staph infection<\/a>, a common bacterial infection in humans.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>S. epidermidis is considered part of the of the normal human microbial flora, while S. aureus is usually regarded as a transient member. Colonization by either species usually does not lead to adverse events. However, when these organisms or their extracellular products are allowed to breach the epithelial layer, serious disease can result (1). S. aureus has many cell surface virulence factors (such as protein A and clumping factor) and secreted exotoxins and enzymes that allow strains to cause a myriad of infections. These diseases range from relatively benign furuncles and subcutaneous abscesses to scalded skin syndrome, sepsis, necrotizing pneumonia, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). While no single cell surface virulence factor has been shown to be uniquely required for mucous membrane attachment, once colonization occurs, numerous secreted exotoxins, including the pyrogenic toxin superantigens and exfoliative toxins, definitively cause serious human disease. Other secreted exotoxins, such as the four hemolysins (α, β, δ, and γ) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin have also been suggested to contribute to significant illnesses. S. epidermidis does not possess the array of extracellular toxins that S. aureus does, and its primary virulence factor is considered to be its ability to form biofilms.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>To improve their ability to cause this variety of human disease and to occupy numerous niches within the host, staphylococci have developed quorum-sensing systems that enable cell-to-cell communication and regulation of numerous colonization and virulence factors.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Viruses are typically simpler - as @MattDMo describes. They seem to rely on finding an environment where they can infect more cells at such a rate greater than the immune system can clear them out.  For influenza, this is more of a 'shock and awe' offense where they infect and multiply quickly, trying to outpace the immune system.  Another virus like HIV will actually multiply so slowly that the immune system can't find the host cells, allowing HIV to slowly spread over the host cell population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a bonus topic... When they were looking a cholera in the 1990s they found that V cholerae bacteria actually t<a href=\"http://microbiology.ucsf.edu/micro/pathogenesis/course/05%20Lectures/MPDisc_0506_Waldor.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ake up phage with toxins in them that convert benign bacteria to virulent ones<\/a> (that cause dysenteric cholera).  They do this by conveying both the pili that attach to human cells and the toxin that causes the violent G.I. reaction of dysentery.  I think this is not unusual for bacterial diseases.  (the reference is Science 272, 1910-14 BTW). <\/p>\n\n<p>This has lead to a suspicion that bacteria might be even <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121220195237.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3a%20sciencedaily/plants_animals%20%28ScienceDaily%3a%20Plants%20&amp;%20Animals%20News%29&amp;utm_content=My%20Yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">adapting to infectious phenotypes through genomic changes<\/a>.  This study had sequenced the genome of C difficile from 486 patients and found that relatively few of them really were capable of patient to patient infection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The results of the study indicated that, although transmission between patients is likely to occur, it actually happens at relatively low frequency.

The larger the construct is, the more difficult it will be to get it into your target cells in one piece, without degradation or shearing. Since the transformation efficiency is lower, you are getting fewer whole constructs per cell, so depending on how you've set up your promoters, the overall expression level can be significantly lower. The trouble with splitting your genes amongst two or more plasmids is that each will have different transformation efficiencies, and there will be a certain (perhaps large) number of cells that don't get the full complement of genes, interfering with phenotype analysis. And again, you'll also have to consider differential expression rates.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, once you get your vector into the cells in one piece, theoretically they should all get expressed at approximately equal levels (assuming identical promoters). It's possible that steric hindrance among multiple transcription complexes may occur - I just don't know enough about bacterial transcription and the effects of circular plasmids to say.<\/p>\n\n<p>One way to get around many of these factors would be to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_artificial_chromosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">bacterial artificial chromosome<\/a> or BAC.

The instinctive behaviour is also known as a fixed action pattern or FAP which is a collection of well-defined motor patterns that are activated in response to a stimulus, i.e. a group more eleborate reflexes [2]. FAPs allow the brain to concentrate on other things as they don't need require time or energy to be thought about. The theory is they've been selected for because they decrease choice and decision time, which can be particularly important to survival.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some cool examples here (<a href=\"http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n09/fastfacts/comportold_i.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n09/fastfacts/comportold_i.htm<\/a>).\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GTzhS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>the bird is continues to perform parental instinctive behaviour in the absence of a brood of chicks because the similar stimulus of hungry open-mouthed fish is present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another article draws comparisons between different animals as to how much of their behaviour is fixed/pre-determined [3]. There can be a correlation between the size of the cerebral cortex, used for thinking and problem solving, and the amount of innate behaviour (i.e. the bigger your cortex the less you need to rely on pre-determined behaviours in certain situations). <\/p>\n\n<p>These patterns seem to be for the most part genetically determined, however some studies with song-birds in the 70's demonstrated that a learning aspect can modify the innate behviour. Birds which have been reared in an environemnt where they cannot hear other birds of the same species sing still sing their typical song, but when allowed to hear others sing the song becomes more complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>Investigating the genetic basis behind innate behaviours involve searching for Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) or stretches of DNA that contain genes (complex traits require the concerted actions of multiple genes) or are linked to genes that are involved in determining a specifc trait (in this case a behaviour). Classically this involves crossing two animals that differ in the trait you're interested in and looking at the segregation patterns in the offspring to try and pinpoint the specifc region of DNA/collection of genes that control the trait. I think quite a lot of this has been done in insects and mice which have high breeding rates and can be studied easily in the lab. <\/p>\n\n<p>...at this risk of making this answer ridiculously long I've just included a snippet from another website on behavioural genetics which details the OMIM and some of the traits you can search for[4]:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a large, searchable, up-to-date database of human genes, genetic traits, and disorders.

Your modified lifetime reproductive output still leaves out many variables which can affect λ. By your own words it leaves out mutations and daughter cells that are dead-on-arrival. There could also be predation or conditions where the Mother-cell produces more than one Daughter-cell, resulting in R = 3 instead of 2 and your subsequent λ also being 3. <a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-bioengineers-discover-confined-235851.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">UCLA Bioengineers have actually observed up to 5 daughter cells in cancer lines.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean by \"... or it depends on the natural situation?\", but ultimately reality is always more complicated than basic equations usually describe.

In short, <strong>r-Selection<\/strong> is the reproductive strategy of producing extraordinary amounts of offspring with a very, very low survival rate.

There is nothing special about how these metastases cause death, they do so in the same ways as the primary cancer eventually might:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Replacing functional cells with non-functional cancerous cells<\/li>\n<li>Eroding into other tissues and disrupting normal body architecture <\/li>\n<li>Causing haemorrhage <\/li>\n<li>Putting pressure onto other structures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If we apply those principles to lung and liver secondary tumours, it is easy to see why they are likely to contribute significantly to mortality.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Cancerous masses in the lungs reduce the surface area available for gas exchange, reducing oxygen saturation of the patient.  The tumour may also erode into a primary bronchus, which if obstructed would cause lung collapse, or into the mediastinum.  If the mediastinum is involved then the great vessels or heart may be invaded into with significant consequences.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Liver metastases are more likely to cause problems due to the reduction of liver function as the cancer grows. This causes a plethora of problems as the liver is involved in so many pathways within the body.  Examples of serious effects would include the patient becoming coagulopathic due to a reduction in production of clotting factors, making bleeding much more severe.  The liver can begin to fail to clear toxins from the blood, leading to the risk of acidosis or hepatic encephalopathy (leading to coma and eventual death).  If the tumour were to invade the portal vein, this can cause portal hypertension, which in turn shunts pressure into the systemic venous system.  This can cause oesophageal varices which are prone to spontaneous and catastrophic bleeding. Similarly a tumour invading the common bile duct (or other part of the biliary tree) can cause obstructive jaundice and associated problems. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason your quote suggests that most deaths are from metastases than the primary tumour is probably because tumours in these locations have greater negative effects at a smaller size because they are in crucial tissues.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There may be another contributing factor in the form of data interpretation, however.

I'm going to cite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins%3a_How_a_Scientist_Changed_the_Way_We_Think\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alan Grafen's essay here<\/a>, \nRichard Dawkins, proposes that the logical, fundamental unit of evolution is the <a href=\"http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/dawkins_replicators.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">replicator<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The replicator is the fundamental unit of reproduction - whether these replicators survive or do not defines the properties of the biological system they reside in.  These words were chosen carefully because DNA sequences themselves are not replicators exactly - many individual copies make up the animals in a gene pool and the replication of one copy or another doesn't matter.  The distinction between a physical strand of DNA and the replicator is the bulk of more than one of Dawkins book.  It shows why the life of an individual means nothing to biology or evolution, how the boundaries of genes as transcriptional elements do not define the replicon (commonly misunderstood by molecular biologists).  The replicon (a genetic unit of replication) manifests a behavior or phenotype in the organism that helps it reproduce and is reproduced.  This can be cooperation with other members of your species or egg rolling or killing other sperm and is usually the result of many individual mRNA transcripts working in concert.  A given gene as defined by mRNA transcription commonly participates in multiple replicon type behaviors. <\/p>\n\n<p>But DNA is in the mind of the molecular biology camp highly intertwined as a replicator because it is the physical medium through which the replicator is passed from one generation to another.  Without DNA, meiosis and the rest there are no replicons.  The earliest replicators were possibly simple transcripts which self replicated and not much more, but over time they have become a network of intertwined molecules working in a system.<\/p>\n\n<p>To my understanding this is axiom more than proof.  It does not need to be proven because the physical transmission of DNA replication over time is the minimal necessary scenario to picture biology and evolution as we understand it.  The selection amongst groups of genes or groups of cells or groups of individual multicellular animals seem unnecessary given the physical framework of DNA replication.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Certainly that these connections have been shown.  The inspiration for The Selfish Gene is the confirmation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trivers#Influence\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Triver's<\/a> Selfish Gene hypothesis with the discovery of <em>t<\/em> a terribly selfish gene which takes up the better part of chromosome in drosophila and increases its chances of showing up in the next generation by showing up in sperm more than half the time.  There are lots of other examples in the Selfish Gene and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Extended Phenotype<\/a>, which answers many of the common questions about this thesis.  The literature since has been pretty productive. That being understood, its one thing to prove that something is true in biology, and another thing to prove that all other similar mechanisms are simply not true.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Yet even in Dawkins essays we see that the replicator is a bit of an abstraction some practically indefinable group of genes. Even as they each compete against each other, they create phenotypes collectively and the replicon becomes abstracted from the fundamental mechanism of replication.  The most popular example of replication Dawkins creates - the meme - has no relationship to DNA at all - a sticky idea that spreads socially and replicates in the minds of individuals.  <\/p>\n\n<p>When we look at terribly complicated but obviously advantageous behaviors, the connection between the replicator and the competition of individual genes gets muddy.

Unlike others, Wilson has I think always kept the conversation scientific and isn't jumping off any ideological cliffs (though responses say differently, the whole conversation is still published).  <\/p>\n\n<p>I don't see how an unbiased forum can ignore the fact that the editors of Nature still call this an open discussion.  Some may object, but calling the subject closed is overreaching I feel.

I expect others will post their corrections/objections/views - please do!  Whenever group selection is mentioned it often happens that someone will pop up and say 'this is not appropriate for a scientific discussion of biology here' but never any justification of disqualifying questions - I think that's not really scientific.  The fundamental attraction to academic thought to me is that minority voices that have legitimate observations are tolerated and often result in scientific revolutions, after which they are venerated for their persistence.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a good place to tell us why some questions are beneath discussion in biology.  I personally do not agree; even if a position is intertwined by politics and religion, its the scientific value that should be judged, not by the company it keeps - lest science become just another intolerant clot, not driven by logic, observation and facts.

Any ingested nutrient will lead to an increase in the growth rates of bacteria capable of metabolising that nutrient, and will therefore lead to a change in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is, unfortunately, difficult to observe, as most studies of the intestinal microbiota use fecal samples to look at intestinal microbial composition. Since stool represents an average of what happens between two bowel movements, it is difficult to draw inferences about short-term changes in the microbial composition of the bowel. However, there is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20520652\" rel=\"nofollow\">evidence<\/a> from Pythons that suggests extensive remodelling of the microbial composition does indeed occur, at least in animals with less regular feeding schedules.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of long-term changes, there is strong evidence that specific oligosaccharides contained in human milk <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/48/18964.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">specifically select<\/a> for certain strains of <em>Bifidobacterium<\/em> and <em>Lactobacillus<\/em>. Apart from this very specific set of oligosaccharides however, there is a paucity of studies dealing with the effects of diet on the gut microbiota, and even fewer looking at specific nutrients. <\/p>\n\n<p>The premise that long-term changes to the gut microbiota can be made with diets is the foundation on which the entire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebiotic_%28nutrition%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">prebiotics<\/a> industry is built. The most popular prebiotics are fructo-oligosaccharide, inulin, galacto-oligosaccharide and lactulose.

One model for this problem is the reconstruction model, which calculates the minimal edit distance between a possible superstring (that contains all fragments) and each one of the fragments. What I don't understand yet is the fact that when calculating the edit distance for a given fragment, it's necessary to calculate the edit distance for the reverse complement of that fragment.<br/> An example of a fragment and its reverse complement could be:<br/><br/>\n ACTGTCC fragment<br/>\n TGACAGG complement (the complementary strand as we know)<br/>\n GGACAGT reverse complement<br/><br/>\nAccording to the book I'm reading the ideia behind it is to find a superstring as short as possible that either the given fragment or its reverse complement must be an approximate substring of the superstring.

This Na<sup>+<\/sup> gradient is, in turn, generated by a pump which uses ATP to move Na<sup>+<\/sup> out and K<sup>+<\/sup> in.

Smaller proteins will refold more easily than larger ones. Hydrophilic proteins tend to refold better than more hydrophobic ones, especially membrane-bound proteins. Multi-subunit proteins/complexes tend to need some help to properly reassemble. Adding in chaperones/heat shock proteins will almost certainly help the process along for all but the smallest and hardiest samples, and will give you better results than just dialyzing all the salts/detergents/chaotropic agents away into PBS.

Telomeres are not replaced (in normal cells), which gives rise to a <em>replicative lifespan<\/em>; the number of times a cell can divide before permenantly leaving the cell cycle (senescence).\n<ul>\n<li>This is generally viewed as an anti-cancer mechanism to protect against errors creeping in to the genome through many cell divisions. In order to become cancerous, a cell must first overcome its replicative lifespan [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgp268\">ref.<\/a>]. This is achieved by activating the (normally inactive) <em>telomerase<\/em> enzyme that extends the telomeres - embryonic stem cells are one of the few cell types that normally express this enzyme.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are other ways in which you could argue that our lifespans are fundamentally limited, but <strong>it is important to note that the objective is not 'to die', but to increase <em>fitness<\/em><\/strong> (in a Darwinian sense) <strong>earlier in life<\/strong>. This is known as <em>antagonistic pleiotropy<\/em>; when an advantageous trait early in life is disadvantageous later in life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Telomere shortening is just one example of antagonistic pleiotropy (protects against cancer when younger, but limits the number of times your cells can divide).<\/p>\n\n<p>Other traits that inherently limit lifespan include;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neurons (as a rule) do not replicate, and last for your whole life time. This certainly excludes them from replicate senescence, however it means they are highly susceptible to 'wear and tear'; oxidative stress is a natural by-product of respiration, and the vast majority of damage done by these species (e.g. reactive oxygen species) is repaired by the cell, however some will always remain unchecked, and eventually this leads to neurological dysfunction and cognitive decline. <strong>Without intervention this is inevitable in each individual (the <em>rate<\/em> of aging differs between people, but aging and age-dependent diseases are disorders are a natural part of living)<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>The same is true for cardiac and smooth muscle - whilst much repair can be carried out, it is inevitable that damage will creep in over a life time, and thus the vast majority of human age-related deaths are due to cardiac problems in one way or another.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So there is no 'programmed' limit to life span, in that we have not evolved to die, but our bodies are inherently limited by the systems that have evolved. Life expectancy a few thousand years ago was ~20 years (if you lived beyond infancy!), whereas now in the developed world this is ~80 years, so our bodies can already survive way beyond our 'natural' life span, and thus we now succumb to age-related disease. <strong>Evolution has spent millions of years giving us every possible advantage that leads to reproductive success. Natural selection of traits beyond reproduction are secondary to those beforehand<\/strong>, and thus we have fundamentally limited life spans.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is an argument for an evolutionary advantage of limited lifespan. This seems at first counter-intuitive, until you consider that natural selection does not act on individuals, but genes. It is proposed to be advantageous (in some circumstances) for an organism to have a shorter life span, as this increases the turn-over of individuals in that population. This in turn increases their <em>evolvability<\/em> - clearly advantageous for the gene(s) influencing this trait if it increases the likelihood of successful reproduction and thus passing on that gene/allele/trait...  <\/p>\n\n<p>I like this hypothesis, and can see that natural selection may favour it. I think mice are great examples here; they have much shorter lifespans than us, yet they 'age' (biologically) the same (cardiac problems, diabetes, cancer) but at a faster rate to give a higher population turnover). In a high mortality environment, the most adaptable animals will be more successful.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I think this is likely to be secondary to the pressures on other survival traits that  more directly increase the chances of successful reproduction.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2880,"question_id":2879,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1342191976}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2879/are-human-bodies-programmed-to-die","last_activity_date":1368768501,"creation_date":1342084699,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are human bodies programmed to die?","body":"<p>Following from this question: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1495/what-is-the-evolutionary-advantage-of-death\">What is the evolutionary advantage of death?<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there any evidence that human bodies have systemic self-destruction built into their developmental program?
