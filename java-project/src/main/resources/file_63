The mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis, transport,\n  and signal transduction\n  are conserved in monocots and dicots make this question more complex (McSteen 2010). Early research has\n  proposed that the selectivity of auxinic herbicide is because of\n  either limited translocation or rapid degradation\n  of exogenous auxin, altered vascular anatomy, or altered perception of auxin in monocots (Monaco et al. 2002;\n  Kelley and Riechers 2007). Auxin transport is influenced by plant vascular\n  systems (Mattsson et al. 1999;\n  Scarpella et al. 2006). The difference in vascular tissue structure between dicots\n  and monocots may contribute\n  to the selectivity of auxinic herbicides. In monocot\n  stems, the vascular tissues (the phloem and xylem) are\n  scattered in bundles, and lack a vascular\n  cambium; in dicot stems, the vascular tissues are form\n  ed in rings and\n  possess a cambium. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So in other words, we don't know yet. It seems to be very strongly tied to auxin transport, but we do not have the full mechanism of action; since auxin is such an important plant hormone, and the pathway is therefore highly conserved (that is, the genes tend to be nearly identical on the parts of the sequence that affect the phenotype), the general conclusion is that the pathway itself is not affected, but an accessory pathway clears up auxin in levels excess of any normal amount in monocots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: Whoops, got the author's first/last names mixed up.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20138,"question_id":20006,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20006/why-doesnt-the-herbicide-2-4-d-damage-lawn-grass","last_activity_date":1422415230,"creation_date":1406520901,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why doesn't the herbicide 2,4-D damage lawn grass?","body":"<p>I sometimes use <a href=\"http://www.ruralking.com/agristar-2-4-d-amine-1-gallon.html?utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_source=google&amp;CAWELAID=1624250989&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;catargetid=520009190000031013&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwxtKeBRDMzoeQmYn5uHcSJACGCF3Dhs22FITlehPhZgOacOeZU5_PbIz8W8iI4BOsuTyoPBoCeW7w_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow\">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid<\/a> to control broadleaved weeds in lawns.

And I think most of the companies involved will sell non-hazardous reagents to anyone with a credit card. The biggest problem is that it would be expensive. You&#39;d definitely need a centrifuge of some sort. And of course the <b>big<\/b> barrier is that you need to have some idea what you&#39;re doing."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":0,"post_id":28096,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3aea672353a508f4b88649324d810d12?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":13219,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13219/leon-avery","reputation":196,"display_name":"Leon Avery"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1422424507,"comment_id":45872,"body":"@LeonAvery The expense is why I mentioned phenol and chloroform, if you have the money for qiagen kits you probably don&#39;t need to worry about at home molecular biology.

THERE MAY BE LEGAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN CREATING A GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM, EVEN A HARMLESS ONE, DEPENDING ON YOUR LOCATION. SOME OF THE CHEMICALS REQUIRED TO HANDLE DNA ARE DANGEROUS, AND SHOULD ONLY BE HANDLED IN A FUME HOOD AND WITH PROPER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. I <em>HIGHLY<\/em> RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>First, you cannot do genetic engineering outside of a lab. You <strong>might<\/strong> be able to set up a lab at home, but don't expect to do this using standard household chemicals. Lets assume you're only interested in adding DNA to bacteria, because that's <strong>relatively<\/strong> simple.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first step you need to add DNA to bacteria is to get the DNA. Your major plasmid suppliers probably won't like selling to a non-lab, but if you're lucky you might get some from Invitrogen, Aldevron, or another supplier. If you know someone who works in a molecular biology lab, you might be able to get some from them, but that might violate rules with their university or employer. If possible, I'd get a green or red fluorescent protein gene, as those proteins are easy to detect using a UV lamp you might be able to build with UV LEDs, you might also be able to use a black light. Note that I do not know what promoter would be best to use on your gene. The lac operon is often used to express proteins in BL21 E. coli using the molecule IPTG as an inducer, but that requires you to have IPTG and BL21 bacteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speaking of bacteria, you need competent bacteria. E. coli is the most often used species, but several strains are available. DH5a E. coli is most often used to grow up DNA plasmids, which is something you'll want to do because you probably won't be able to get much plasmid, so you have to make more or you'll run out. But DH5a usually isn't used to produce protein. BL21 E. coli is most often used to produce protein, but you'll probably need IPTG to induce the bacteria to make the protein. You might be able to get IPTG from Sigma Aldrich, but good luck getting them to sell anything to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have the bacteria, you'll need to grow them. You need bacterial media, which might be obtainable because it's relatively safe. LB media is a mixture of yeast extract, tryptone, and salt. If you want solid plates you'll need agar too. You can probably get the media sterile enough by boiling it. You'll need some ampicillin or kanamycin to make sure only bacteria with your desired gene is allowed to grow, again Sigma Aldrich <strong>might<\/strong> sell it to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course you can't just put DNA into bacteria, the bacteria must be competent. You can make chemically competent cells by carefully treating them with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. You'll also need dry ice, these need to be kept very cold. So now you can add your plasmid your competent cells, heat shock them in water at precisely 37°C for precisely 60 seconds, and plate them on your agar media. Then you need to incubate them at 37°C overnight.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you need to purify the DNA plasmid back from the bacteria, you need to pick a colony off that plate and put it in liquid LB media, also at 37°C overnight with antibiotic. Here you'll need a centrifuge to spin down the cells and remove the left over media. Then you'll need to lyse the cells to release the DNA. You might be able to do this with soap, but you'll probably need NaOH and SDS. Once the cells are lysed you need neutralize them with an acetic acid solution, vinegar <strong>might<\/strong> be good enough. Then you have to centrifuge the cell debris to pull the insoluble crap out and leave the plasmid DNA and RNA in the supernatent. At this point you can extract the DNA and RNA with a phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mix. Good luck getting that, as the vapors from that solution <strong>are harmful to inhale, and really bad if you spill it on you, and should not be used outside a hood<\/strong>. But if you manage to get the extraction to work, take the top layer and add an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol and put it in your freezer for a couple hours. Then spin it down, carefully remove the supernatent and you should have a pellet of DNA in the bottom. You might have to clean the pellet with a 70% ethanol solution (140 proof) and another centrifugation. Quantifying your DNA at home will be almost impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, this all assumes you just want to put a ready-made plasmid into bacteria. Trying to change the plasmid will require restriction enzymes, PCR, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>So yes, you can do genetic engineering at home if your home has an incubator (preferably with shaking), a centrifuge, a water bath, a -80°C freezer, a fume hood, a variety of chemicals, and a decent set of pipettes. But if you have $10,000 you don't really need you might be ok.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28096,"question_id":28095,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1422398823}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28095/can-genetic-engineering-be-performed-without-a-laboratory-setting","last_activity_date":1422408128,"creation_date":1422388092,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can genetic engineering be performed without a laboratory setting?","body":"<p>I'm becoming more interested in genetic engineering as I learn more about it, and it's becoming more and more apparent that there's very few resources on genetic engineering at home.

This is the key to understanding why life on Earth doesn't violate the second law: Earth absorbs and re-radiates roughly the same amount of light, but that light's state is radically changed as this happens, and this state change and the huge entropy increase it brings about overwhelmingly offsets the decrease in Earth's organisms' entropy as they build themselve whilst making use of that light.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's look at the radiation balance in more detail.<\/p>\n\n<p>The thermodynamic entropy of a system is basically the system's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">conditional information content<\/a> (also known evocatively as <em>equivocation<\/em> in information theoretic circles) conditioned on the given macroscopic properties of a system. It's the logarithm of the number of ways a system's internal microstates can be arranged consistent with the observed outward properties. A simple explanation of the logarithm is that when you add two systems together, the number of ways that they can be arranged multiplies (think of two car number plate letters: one letter yields 26 different number plates, two letters $26^2$ number plates, three letters $26^3$ number plates, three letters and two digits yields $26^3\\times 10^2$ number plates and so forth). So the entropies add when the possibilities multiply.<\/p>\n\n<p>The entropy of a system of identical particles is proportional to the number of particles in that system. Think of each particle as like a letter in an alphabet of its states and then think of long \"number plates\" of concatenated particle states.<\/p>\n\n<p>So now: let's look at the input to the Earth: around about $1{\\rm kg}$ of energy in the form of sunlight per second is available to Earth systems to do work. It comes as $\\frac{c^2}{h\\,\\nu}$ photons per second, where $\\lambda = \\frac{c}{\\nu}$ is of the order of 500nm so $\\nu\\approx600{\\rm THz}$. That is, about $2\\times 10^{35}$ photons per second. <\/p>\n\n<p>The energy <em>output<\/em> of the Earth is basically infrared heat: it's the same amount of energy as comes in, but it is now composed of many more photons, because now $\\nu$ in the photon number $\\frac{c^2}{h\\,\\nu}$ is of the order of $30{\\rm THz}$ (corresponding to $\\lambda=10{\\rm \\mu\\,m}$). The Earth therefore radiates roughly twenty times more photons than it absorbs: about $4\\times 10^{36}$ photons per second. Each photon can encode the same amount of information, so the entropy increase is roughly <em>twentyfold<\/em>. Life systems on Earth use about one thousandth of the incident Solar energy: it has been estimated that photosynthesis fixes energy for use by life systems at the rate of about $100{\\rm TW}=10^{14}{\\rm J\\,s^{-1}}$, compared with an input of $1{\\rm kg\\,s^{-1}}\\approx 10^{17}{\\rm J\\,s^{-1}}$. So, no matter how complex life organisms get, this barely makes a dint on the massive entropy \"production\" of the total Earth energy cycle: the nett production of entropy by the whole Earth system is still strongly positive notwithstanding the presence and evolution of life, and therefore in keeping with the Second Law.<\/p>\n\n<p>An interesting calculation has been done on how much Solar energy is needed to evolve life on Earth to the present day.

Any system tries to avoid confinement and maximize the number of states it can occupy. However if the system is in a stable state and any movement would cost it energy, then it would remain in the present state at the cost of reduced degree of freedom. <\/p>\n\n<p>This relationship is described by this equation: <strong>ΔG = ΔH -TΔS<\/strong> <br>Where <strong>ΔG<\/strong> is change in the Gibbs free energy, <strong>ΔH<\/strong> is change in enthalpy, <strong>ΔS<\/strong> is change in entropy and <strong>T<\/strong> is the temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though the process of natural selection destroys the number of phenotypic states that life can occupy, thereby causing a decrease in entropy, there are other processes which lead to gain in entropy (for example population growth and migration). Note that the process of reproduction itself creates order from disordered molecules, but as the population expands and spreads entropy is again maximized. As already pointed out by bobc, catabolic processes which fuel life processes increase entropy but anabolic processes do the opposite.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my opinion is that the process of <strong>Natural Selection<\/strong> reduces entropy, so is the formaton of the eukaryotic cell.

By definition, two individuals are related only if they have a common ancestor. (If you mean something else by it, please correct me. For completeness, I include the trivial case in this: that is, I regard you as one of your own ancestors.) So your question can be inverted: it is really asking after how many generations <strong>everyone<\/strong> in the ancestral population is your ancestor? <\/p>\n\n<p>As indicated in the comments, the answer will depend on the specifics of the population structure, including its size. But a first stab can be taken in this way: you had 2 ancestors one generation back, 4 two generations back, ..., $2^n$ (not necessarily distinct) $n$ generations back. So you certainly cannot be descended from everyone in the ancestral population if less than $\\log_2 N$ generations have passed. ($N$ = population size, which for simplicity I assume to be stable.) In a freely mixing population under the very simplest assumptions, you will eventually decay exponentially towards complete coverage with a half-time of one generation. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is complicated by the fact that some lineages die out completely. For instance, some of the individuals in the ancestral population didn't have any children. Some had children, but no grandchildren, etc. Obviously none of them were your ancestors, so you will never be related to them (except through previous common ancestors), no matter how much time passes. In fact, as time passes, more lineages tend to die out. So, if you look back very far, you'll find that the entire current population has only a very small numbers of ancestors in the distant past. This is called coalescence, and is what people are talking about when they speak of \"mitochondrial Eve\", for instance. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, it's complicated. It takes only a fairly small number of generations ($O(\\log_2 N)$) before you're potentially related to most of the ancestral population. But over longer times ($O(N)$ generations) your relationship to the ancestral population actually goes down. <\/p>\n","answer_id":28087,"question_id":28042,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1422373352}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28042/after-how-many-generations-descendant-is-not-more-related-to-ancestor-than-to-a","last_activity_date":1422373688,"creation_date":1422256616,"answer_count":1,"title":"After how many generations descendant is not more related to ancestor, than to a random individual in an ancestral population?","body":"<p>Descendant of n generation has on average 1/2<sup>n<\/sup> DNA of ancestor.

A protein called MutS scans DNA for lesions caused by mismatched nucleotides incorporated during replication that escaped DNA polymerase proofreading. These are detected by the kink they produce in the DNA backbone. MutS recruits MutL and MutH; the former activates the latter, which is an endonuclease. MutH cuts the DNA backbone near the lesion in the newly synthesized strand (the one containing the misincorporated nucleotide). This strand can be identified because it has not yet been methylated, while the parent strand contains the original methylation. After cleavage, UvrD helicase unwinds the strand and an exonuclease digests it. The gap around the former lesion can then be filled by DNA polymerase III and DNA ligase. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1lHQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>[ <a href=\"http://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DNA_mismatch_repair.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">image adapted from<\/a> ]<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's an interesting review in a Nature publication that discusses it in more depth, as well as the mechanism in humans:\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v18/n1/full/cr2007115a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guo-Min L. 2008.

In the end apoptotic bodies are formed from the cell. Additionally the mitochondria break down and release cytochrome c and ATP. Their release from the cell attracts macrophages which take up and eliminate the apoptotic bodies and in turn release cytokines which suppress an inflammatory response.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apoptosis goes on in a ordered way and does not trigger any further reactions in neighbouring cells (except these receive the same signal). See also reference 1 and 2 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Necrosis is triggered by external stimuli of the cell as injury of tissues or toxins from infections. Necrotic cells swell, while there internal structures are in a state of unregulated degradation. Finally the membrane will burst and set free cytochrome c and phosphatidylserines from the membranes which cause inflammation in the affected tissue. The necrotic cells are not removed by macrophages which allows the released interior of the cell to spread further and cause problems.

It's a form of programmed cell death (in immune cells, e.g. macrophages), so it is similar to apoptosis. However, instead of a neat and tidy non-phlogistic (inflammatory) death as is the case in apoptosis, the cell purposefully upregulates inflammatory cytokines, swells, and bursts, releasing the cytokines and other inflammatory mediators out into the extracellular space. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UXbHF.jpg\" alt=\"Pyroptosis activation\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroptosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">The wikipedia page on this is quite good<\/a>, and for this image and more information you can check out <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910423/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this study<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's a response to certain Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs).

This pro-inflammatory response attracts other immune cells to the area, and helps to drive an immune response, containing and aiding in the elimination of the invading pathogens.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: OP may also be interested to know that if an apoptotic cell is not cleared by a macrophage, eventually it will become \"secondarily necrotic\", meaning the membrane eventually falls apart and the cell releases it's contents (<a href=\"http://cshperspectives.net/content/5/1/a008748.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>).

Since the cells are rapidly dividing and the DNA gets duplicated each time a cell splits, more and more mutations accumulate as the tumor grows and metastasizes. Just like in evolution as a whole, mutations that are either neutral or help the cell survive better in its environment are kept, whereas cells that develop deleterious mutations (perhaps killing the cell outright, making it more visible to the immune system, or just giving it a growth disadvantage as compared to neighboring cells) either die out or get outnumbered by other cells. This is why, over time, tumors can become resistant to therapies intended to kill them, as their cells accumulate mutations that help it evade the treatment and keep growing. There may be a disadvantage that the cells might grow more slowly than the original ones, but since the original ones were killed by the treatment, the resistant ones survive. So, this means that a tumor is rarely homogeneous, with all the cells having the exact same genome. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sequencing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deep sequencing<\/a> using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-generation_methods\" rel=\"nofollow\">next-generation methods<\/a> is being used to gather information on all the different mutations throughout a tumor, which can help doctors learn which mutations are most common and prescribe patient-specific <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">combination therapy<\/a> which can kill all the various cell populations at once.<\/p>\n\n<p>So why are metastatic and xenografted tumors different from the parent?

As they grow and divide, as described above, they will become different from their parents. The surrounding environment definitely affects this: the amount of oxygen present, degree of vascularization and blood supply, number and kind of immune cells present, etc. With all these and more factors, a metastasis or xenograft will evolve differently than its parents.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28002,"question_id":27997,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27997/why-does-a-tumours-genome-change-depending-on-the-environment","last_activity_date":1422142374,"creation_date":1422129184,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does a tumour's genome change depending on the environment?","body":"<p>According to the book \"Primer of The Molecular Biology of Cancer\" by Vincent, Theodore and Ateven, the tumour cell is <strong>changed depending on its environment.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>performed genome-wide analysis on three tumor samples: a patient's primary breast tumor; her metastatic brain tumor, which formed despite therapy; and a xenograft tumor in a mouse, originating from the patient's breast tumor.

We are doing much worse at telling apart animals from other species just because we have not evolved for this purpose. This is the reason why we tend to see human faces when looking at clouds but we rarely see sheep faces! Several studies (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6860/full/414165a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1476/2155.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>) showed that sheep are able to recognize each other (and we even know the number of neurones needed to remember one face). They are probably better at telling two sheep apart than telling two human apart.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another interesting fact is the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">cross-race effect<\/a>. We, humans, are better at recognizing faces of people from our own ethnic group than faces of people from other ethnic groups. For example, a Japanese is very good at Japanese faces recognition but not good at recognizing European faces. Same is true the other way around.<\/p>\n\n<p>As @user568459 said in the comments: some people are not able to recognize faces. This is due to a cognitive disease called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prosopagnosia<\/a> (also called face blindness). Those suffering from this disease are not better at recognizing sheep faces than human faces.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So consider the class of cats they are one type of species so why aren't they diverse in phenotype like us?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no good definition I think of what is phenotypic diversity (no accurate and objective index to measure it) but at first sight I would tend to think that cats are more diverse than humans. One of the main features one would probably raise when talking about human diversity is skin color. And in terms of color, cats are much more diverse than humans. You may think of an extraordinary diversity when thinking of Norwegian that are taller than Indonesian (I may not have chosen the two extremes) by several centimeters on average but think about cats! The average cat weight 4 to 5 kg but some cats weight less than 2 kg and some other (like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon\" rel=\"nofollow\">coon cat<\/a>) weight more than 10 kg (<a href=\"http://www.cat-world.com.au/cat-world-records\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Record<\/a>: 21.3 kg). Imagine a human ethnic group that would on average weight 5 times more than another ethnic group! And think also about cats' hair length or tail shape! Humans vary in terms of facial feature (lips size, nose shape, etc.) so do cats. Some look like their face was smashed against a wall while others have a long muffle.

Many species also evolved in order to recognize their own. In some species individuals use smell rather than visual features in order to recognize each other (odor is also a kind of phenotypic variation). But still some species are poor to recognize each other. For a bird, it seems rather easy to not feed the wrong individual as all their offspring are usually together in the same nest. However you might be interested the lifestyle of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cuckoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">cuckoo<\/a> who parasites nests of other bird species. Cuckoos' babies and particularly the inner beak resemble to the babies of the species they parasite and often the parents (often the mother only is involved in feeding the young) get fooled and feed the cuckoo.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So can i say they aren't diverse because of in their meiosis division their chromosomes don't cross over and random assort (alignment)?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, you can't say that! Because they are diverse and because for many of the species you may think about, cross-over does occur. Their genetic diversity as well as their phenotypic diversity is as high than in humans. There is nothing extraordinary about humans (except their brain and the related fact that we predigest our food by cooking it) compare to other lineages. And there is nothing extraordinary to have one extraordinary feature (such as a big brain) that you can't find in other lineages!

First he noted the wide variation between many types of living organism: between species of plant, fish, bird and mammal; and also between different family groups within the same species; and also between different exemplars within the same family. Wherever we look - and during his five year voyage on The Beagle in his early twenties, there were few places on earth where Darwin had not looked - we see differences between organisms: different sizes, different colours, different features, different behaviours and, of course, different survival rates.

That is why it is very common to have particular illnesses in closed communities.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance Amish people have an higher incidence of genetic disorders such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis%E2%80%93van_Creveld_syndrome\">Ellis-van Creveld syndrome<\/a> (a form of dwarfism)<\/p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8661097\">The Gene for the Ellis\u2013van Creveld Syndrome Is Located on Chromosome 4p16<\/a> - Ruiz-Perez et al., Nat. Genetics 2000<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Autosomal recessive transmission of the disorder is supported by\n  multiple affected siblings with unaffected parents in families with\n  known parental consanguinity. The largest known pedigree segregating\n  with EVC is that reported by McKusick and his colleagues in the Old\n  Order Amish (McKusick et al., 1964). The prevalence of living persons\n  affected with EVC among the Lancaster County Amish was estimated to be\n  2 in 1000, whereas the frequency of occurrence among live births was 5\n  in 1000. McKusick et al. estimated that the frequency of heterozygous\n  carriers in the Old Order Amish is as high as 13% (McKusick et al.,\n  1964). All cases of EVC in the Amish at that time were traced to a\n  common founding couple, Samuel King and his wife, who immigrated to\n  Pennsylvania in 1744.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a well known effect, called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect\">founder effect<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for India, a study on the genetic behind casts has been done a couple of years ago. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842210/\">Reconstructing Indian Population History<\/a> - Reich et al., Nature 2010<\/p>\n\n<p>From the paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Haldane wrote 45 years ago that \u201cif inter-caste marriages in India become common, various\u2026 recessive characters will become rarer\u201d. However, it has not been generally appreciated that this applies to groups throughout India, and not only to groups in the south where consanguinity is common. We hypothesize that founder effects are responsible for an even higher burden of recessive diseases in India than consanguinity. \n  To test this hypothesis, we used our data to estimate the probability that two alleles from a group share a common ancestor more recently than that group\u2019s divergence from other Indians, and compared this to the probability that an individual\u2019s two alleles share an ancestor in the last few generations due to consanguinity. <strong>Nine of the 15 Indian groups for which we could make this assessment had a higher probability of recessive disease due to founder events than to consanguinity, including all the Indo-European speaking groups.<\/strong>\n  An additional reason why some diseases are expected to occur at elevated frequencies in India is shared descent from a common Indian ancestral population. An example is a 25 base pair deletion in MYBPC3 that increases heart failure risk by about 7-fold, and occurs at around 4% throughout India but is nearly absent elsewhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They conclude that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have documented a high level of population substructure in India, and have shown that the model of mixture between two ancestral populations ASI and ANI provides an excellent description of genetic variation in many Indian groups. \n  [...]<br>\n  By showing that a large proportion of Indian groups descend from strong founder events, these results highlight the importance of identifying recessive diseases in these groups and mapping causal genes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is very important to understand that this results in no way show a genetic basis for the existence of casts, which remain purely social entities. They rather show that an <strong>environmental<\/strong> constraint can influence the distribution of genetic traits, due to a restriction in the possibility of mixing genes in the population.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1890,"question_id":1866,"up_vote_count":16}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1866/on-the-genetics-behind-caste-marriages","last_activity_date":1422088390,"creation_date":1334755820,"answer_count":1,"title":"On the genetics behind caste marriages","body":"<p>I am in India where it is typically a custom to marry within one's caste.

The importance of starch biosynthesis in the wrinkled seed shape character of peas studied by Mendel. Plant Mol Bio 22(3):525-531<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Abstract:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The wrinkled-seed mutant (rr) of pea (Pisum sativum L.) arose through mutation of the gene encoding starch-branching enzyme isoform I (SBE1) by insertion of a transposon-like element into the coding sequence. Two isoforms of starch-branching enzyme have been documented in the developing pea embryo. The second isoform, SBEII, is expressed towards the later stages of embryo development while SBEI is expressed highly in the early stages. Due to mutation of SBEI the total amount of starch and the proportion of amylopectin, a branched starch polymer, are greatly reduced in the wrinkled (rr) line as compared to that in the wild-type, round (RR) line. Consequently, the level of sucrose in the rr line is nearly two fold that of the RR line. Increased sucrose concentration in the developing embryos of this mutant line causes increased uptake of water and thereby increases the cell size and fresh weight. During seed maturation in these mutant seeds a greater loss of water occurs. As a result, the wrinkled seed phenotype develops. Besides this morphological variation, the mutation also causes changes in the amount of lipid and of one storage protein, legumin. This review article discusses the role of the SBEI enzyme in causing such metabolic changes in the developing embryos with the implication that metabolism can play a central role in plant development.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These authors claim that the mutant protein is not present in peas, so the wrinkled phenotype is not due to an inability of the protein to bind its substrate (amylose and amylopectin - the linear and branched components of starch, respectively) but rather its complete absence. The mutant is due to an 800 bp transposon insertion into the coding sequence of SBE1. If it was expressed, it would be reasonable to expect that it wouldn't be able to bind its substrate. The authors also discuss mutations at other loci that have been shown to be responsible for the wrinkled phenotype, but it is believed that these are relatively newer and would not have been observed by Mendel. <\/p>\n","answer_id":27974,"question_id":27970,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1422039741}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27970/mode-of-enzymatic-inhibition-via-r-allele","last_activity_date":1422039741,"creation_date":1422033960,"answer_count":1,"title":"Mode of Enzymatic Inhibition via R-Allele","body":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cwi1x.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The photo above shows the effects of the R allele of the pea shape gene on the synthesis of an enzyme that converts unbranched starch into branched starch.

The argument is then that \"all the evolving happened gradually, long before the selection event\" because that is when the variation was generated. <\/p>\n\n<p>To me, this seems to be a misuse of the term \"evolution\", which is usually defined as a change in trait or allele frequencies in a population over time. Under that definition, much of the evolution does occur via the selection event. Before, you have a wide range of trait values; after, only a narrow selected set of trait values. In such a model, selection indeed is the major cause of allele frequency or trait value change. <\/p>\n\n<p>In practice, both processes are usually acting in concert; variation is being produced by mutation and recombination and eliminated by selection at comparable rates so that the net amount of variation in the population is at an approximate steady state. This is essentially the model Darwin espouses, though note that Darwin does not have our modern understanding of heredity and therefore is not able to explain how variation is generated or preserved. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional note: When thinking about models of the kind that you describe, it is also key to understand that if you have a large number of loci affecting your trait (e.g. coat thickness), then the Gaussian distribution prior to strong selection will not include the extreme phenotypic values. If there are 20 diploid loci interacting additively to determine coat thickness and the mean individual has 20 thickness alleles and 20 thinness alleles, no individuals in a reasonably sized population will initially have all 40 thickness alleles, or even 39 or 38 etc. Selection for thickness will change the mean, and will also result in individuals outside of the initial range of variation. If the mean is 30, you may well get an individual with 38 or 39 or even all 40 thickness alleles. So once selection occurs, new more extreme phenotypes will suddenly appear. Nothing strange has happened in terms of rates of generating new variation; in fact this is just a consequence of reassorting the current alleles under the new allele frequencies. <\/p>\n","answer_id":27957,"question_id":27952,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27952/gradualism-vs-punctuationalism","last_activity_date":1421992838,"creation_date":1421981296,"answer_count":1,"title":"Gradualism vs. Punctuationalism","body":"<p><strong>TLDR? Just read the bold bits!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I started with Darwin's <em>Origin of Species<\/em>, and then read Dawkins's first three books <em>The Selfish Gene<\/em>, <em>The Extended Phenotype<\/em>, and <em>The Blind watchmaker<\/em> (I just started <em>River out of Eden<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Dawkins talks of Gradualists and Punctuationalists as if their views are incompatible but my initial understanding of Darwin was that <strong>both of these are true<\/strong>. My understanding is that if you look at an individual line of heredity then you will see a very <strong>consistent and gradual change<\/strong> through the generations (at the mutation rate), but if you look at the population as a whole you will see <strong>\"periods of rapid evolution\"<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To me this seems easy to reconcile. Imagine <strong>a gene for fur thickness<\/strong> in polar bears, if each n<sup>th<\/sup> generation has a 'random' mutation for thicker or thinner then for each line of heredity <strong>you'll see a random walk about the starting point<\/strong>. Most of them will go up a bit, then down a bit, and end up close to where they started, some will be a bit further away, and a small number will be far away (much thicker or thinner fur) <strong>in a Gaussian distribution<\/strong>. So any random sample from the population that happens to become <strong>a fossil is most likely to be in the middle<\/strong> (i.e. unchanged over many generations).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if there's a <strong>sudden environmental change<\/strong>, or a one-off freak event such as a very cold winter, say that only the 10% with the thickest fur survived this cold winter (and perhaps a very small number of others who got lucky). Now very quickly within a few generations, that <strong>thick fur gene will dominate<\/strong> and as the population grows back to whatever size the environment can sustain it will be <strong>present in much greater absolute numbers than before the selection event<\/strong>. When looking at random samples of the population throughout this period, you might conclude that there has been a \"period of rapid evolution\". If the change is more gradual than a single sudden event, for example it gets colder over 500 years, each year the ones with the thinnest fur die off and the thicker fur genes get more popular in the population. <strong>This would appear to be a very rapid period of evolution, but really all the evolving happened gradually, long before the selection event<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question really is what's wrong with this view of things? Dawkins seemed to anticipate all my thoughts and objections while I read his books and provided explanations, except for this one.

The average person requires roughly 2000kcal per day if they perform mild physical labor throughout their day - 25.9% of the total energy available in 1kg of fat. So you could say that if a person did not eat for a day they would lose ~1/4kg or 1/2lb of fat-mass.<\/p>\n\n<p>I calculated the above in \"fat\" because it's the number I knew off-hand, but truth be told the amount of \"mass\" you'd lose also depends on density. Fat (9kcal/g) is more energy dense than alcohol (7kcal/g), carbohydrates/sugars (4kcal/g), and protein (4kcal/g). For the same energy expenditure of 2000kcal in a single day you would metabolise more than 1/2kg or 1lb of either carbohydrates or proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>In reality you will burn roughly equal amounts of fats and carbohydrates (assuming you're not forcing your body into a ketogenic state) at about a 55% fat/45% carbs ratio IIRC.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, with the assumption that the person isn't on a keto diet, has sufficient fat reserves, and expends 2000kcal of energy in a single day while drinking enough water to replace what is used in the energy metabolism, you will lose ~.14kg of fat and ~.63kg of carbohydrates for a grand total of <strong><em>~.77kg (~1.69lbs)<\/em><\/strong> of mass expended per day.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since humans vary greatly, however, that is going to vary wildly. Personally speaking, it's easy for me to expend >3000kcal per day with an hour of moderate exercise since I'm simply <em>bigger<\/em> than the average person and require more energy to do anything. If you're shorter than average, do less work than average (i.e. - are sedentary), or hormonal conditions (which are <strong>rare<\/strong> and <em>cannot<\/em> be self-diagnosed) modify calorie expenditure, your numbers will be different.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also worth it to note: Ghrelin, a major hunger-regulating hormone, changes its tonic behavior significantly if you go more than 2 days consuming less than 1200kcal. After 2 days fasting it will instigate changes that will result in more fat <em>retained<\/em> after you resume a regular eating schedule <em>for up to 5 years<\/em>... So starving yourself for a week to lose 5kg seems great until you realize you'll gain 10kg once you go back to a normal diet.<\/p>\n\n<p>As always, if you're unsure of any diets please go to a qualified professional for consultation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27950,"question_id":27939,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27939/how-much-mass-does-a-person-lose-in-a-day-through-breathing-and-perspiration","last_activity_date":1421969303,"creation_date":1421927383,"answer_count":1,"title":"How much mass does a person lose in a day through breathing and perspiration?","body":"<p>Water and carbon are lost through perspiration and breathing.<\/p>\n\n<p>How much mass is lost in this way in a single day for a typical person?<\/p>\n","question_id":27939,"tags":["biochemistry","breathing"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":27950,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hF7Y.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13055,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13055/augustzf","reputation":129,"display_name":"augustzf"},"closed_date":1421966466,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":2,"post_id":27949,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421963622,"comment_id":45341,"body":"I&#39;m voting to close this question as off-topic because it is about gardening.

The segregation of gene variants, called alleles, and their corresponding traits was first observed by Gregor Mendel in 1865. Mendel was studying genetics by performing mating crosses in pea plants. He crossed two heterozygous pea plants, which means that each plant had two different alleles at a particular genetic position He discovered that the traits in the offspring of his crosses did not always match the traits in the parental plants. This meant that the pair of alleles encoding the traits in each parental plant had <strong>separated or segregated<\/strong> from one another during the formation of the reproductive cells. [...] We now know that the segregation of genes occurs during meiosis in eukaryotes, which is a process that produces reproductive cells called gametes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, the <strong>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium<\/strong> is explained on <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium-122\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature's website<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle stating that the <strong>genetic variation in a population will remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So in case of Mendell's experiments, his pea plants showed no disturbance and quite perfect ratios, for example 3:1 green:yellow seed pods:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/I1g3W.gif\" alt=\"seed pods\"> <\/p>\n\n<p>The Nature site continues on the Hardy-Weinberg principle:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When mating is random in a large population with no disruptive circumstances, the law predicts that both genotype and allele frequencies will remain constant because they are in equilibrium. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can be disturbed by a number of forces, including mutations, natural selection, nonrandom mating, genetic drift, and gene flow. [...]. This occurs because certain alleles help or harm the reproductive success of the organisms that carry them. [...]. Because [...] of these disruptive forces [...] the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium rarely applies in reality.

You need to understand it, not seek to make it fit your (especially) <em>electrical circuits with resistors<\/em>. Blood isn't electricity. At least try a fluid dynamics model.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's take this very simple model: Blow up a balloon four-fifths of the way, and put a wide inflatable cuff around its middle. Inflate the cuff so that the balloon bulges just a tiny bit at the ends, then stuff it all into a plexiglass box so that the balloon has no room to expand. The plexiglass box represents our body. Lets call the pressure inside the balloon now normal blood pressure. The air in the balloon represents your total blood volume. It can't change from moment to moment; it's fixed. The box can't change it's volume moment to moment either. It's fixed.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cuff represents arterial smooth muscle. Vasoconstriction can be represented by inflating the cuff further. Constriction (inflation of the cuff) will increase the pressure throughout inside the balloon, because the same amount of gas now has to exist in a smaller space. Vasodilation (deflating the cuff) decreases the pressure inside the balloon, because the gas can now inhabit a larger amount of space.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's it, really. If the same volume must inhabit a smaller, constricted space, the pressure exerted by blood in that space will be higher. If the blood vessles dilate, the pressure in the blood vessels falls.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now add about 20 layers of complexity to that simple model, and you have a working model of the circulatory system.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sparknote answers<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Arterial and arteriolar smooth muscle \"injects energy into the system\", resulting in systemic increases in the pressure existing in the vascular \"circuit\" (meaning somewhat elastic tubing) if <em>resistance<\/em> requires energy.

When biomass turnover is very high (for example in plankton and whales), it is possible for whale biomass to exceed that of the plankton, even through the whales feed on plankton. Therefore, it is better to use a pyramid of energy, where the total energy flux through a specific trophic level is used. See the article <a href=\"http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/energyflow/highertrophic/trophic2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for more detail. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just as with the inverted pyramid of numbers, in some rare exceptions, there could be an inverted pyramid of biomass, where the biomass of the lower trophic level is less than the biomass of the next higher trophic level. The oceans are such an exception because at any point in time the total amount of biomass in microscopic algae is small. Thus a pyramid of biomass for the oceans can appear inverted (see image part b). You should now ask \"how can that be?\" If the amount of energy in biomass at one level sets the limit of energy in biomass at the next level, as was the case with the hares and foxes, how can you have less energy at the lower trophic level? This is a good question, and can be answered by considering, as we discussed in the last lecture, the all important aspect of \"time\". Even though the biomass may be small, the RATE at which new biomass is produced may be very large. Thus over time it is the amount of new biomass that is produced, from whatever the standing stock of biomass might be, that is important for the next trophic level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7O6l.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>2: Biomass conversation rate in each trophic stage.

Consequently, the lens convexity difference between 6 meters gaze and infinity is negligible and this is why the answer to your question is between 6 meters and infinity (zero accommodation).<\/p>\n\n<p>From this explanation you can calculate the dioptric add for any reading distance  and understand how the reading spectacles correct the loss of accommodative power (=presbyopia, the vision of older people).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to know how much the crystalline lens changes its dimensions during accommodation, the answer is near 7% for diameter and near 10% for thickness, so the lens as was convex, stays convex and the visible changes are minimal.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15994,"question_id":15981,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1395505549}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15981/whats-the-minimum-distance-of-focus-for-the-lens-of-a-human-eye-to-reach-maximu","last_activity_date":1421648954,"creation_date":1395401802,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's the minimum distance of focus for the lens of a human eye to reach maximum flatness?","body":"<p>According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_%28eye%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article on eye accomodation<\/a>, the range in which a human eye can focus is from 7 centimetres away up to essentially an infinite distance. Of course, people can't see things an infinite distance away, but at a certain point the light reflected off an object will come at the eye in effectively parallel paths.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an eye focuses on objects progressively farther away, it seems to me there would be a point when the lens hits maximum flatness, after which it everything will be equally sharp in focus. Looking at an object 500 metres away or 1000 metres away probably doesn't require any change in the lens. However, going from one metre away to seven requires the ciliary muscles adjust to just the right amount.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is, <strong>what is a normal minimum distance from the eye at which the lens will reach maximum flatness?<\/strong> Everything else in this question is just for context, so an answer to this, stated in metres from the eye, is all I am seeking.<\/p>\n\n<p>The article I linked to above mentioned the human eye seeing \"13 dioptres\", and I have tried to understand <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diopter\" rel=\"nofollow\">dioptres<\/a>, but it's a little confusing for me. If I understand correctly, the higher the dioptre, the closer you focus, so the 13 dioptres refers to how close the human eye can see. If I have this backwards, please let me know.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, my purpose in asking is to determine the range in which ciliary muscles would be required to do more nuanced work in order to hold the lens at in the right shape. Focusing on something 7 centimetres away, the ciliary muscles are at maximum exertion, and at a certain point and beyond the ciliary muscles are completely relaxed. To hold somewhere in between would require more subtly nuanced, and, I suspect, more difficult work on the part of the ciliary muscles.<\/p>\n\n<p>At least, I assume that to be the case because I am hypothesizing that the act of contraction for the ciliary muscles would be similar to other muscles. For example, it is easier to do a bicep curl with weight when going from full resting position to maximum contraction, as opposed to stopping at a particular spot somewhere in the middle of the motion. To stop mid-motion requires more muscle control, and, depending on how fast you wanted to do it, can be difficult to be exact.<\/p>\n","question_id":15981,"tags":["human-biology","eyes"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":15994,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4015,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1395455022},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mP8wh.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13082,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13082/newintern","reputation":18,"display_name":"newintern"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":27816,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421629689,"comment_id":44852,"body":"Could you expand please?

When you sample the population you would get two peaks. Bistablity (two stable steady states) is a common phenomenon in biological systems and positive feedbacks generally exhibit such behavior. In bistable systems there is also an unstable steady state which lies \"between\" the two stable states (like a mountain separating two valleys). If the system is in the unstable state, it can fall to either of the two stable states. (See <a href=\"http://jb.asm.org/content/194/5/1088.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article for an example).
