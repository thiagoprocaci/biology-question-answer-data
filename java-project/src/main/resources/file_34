Make sure to have a look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia page<\/a>. In short:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mitochondrion contain DNA<\/li>\n<li>mitochondrion is the result of a bacteria that has somehow been internalized into a bigger cell (it is a symbiont). This is why today mitochondrion contain DNA. It is therefore not exactly an organelle like others. Note that plants, in addition to having mitochondrion, they have plasmids that are also consequences of a similar process of internalizing other form of life.<\/li>\n<li>mitochondrion DNA evolve (of course)<\/li>\n<li>mitochondrion are basically the energy factory of the cell.<\/li>\n<li>mitochondrion are not able to live by themselves outside a living cell (to my knowledge).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Definitions of life<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>It is important to understand that the definition of life has absolutely no impact on biology and is nothing but a question of nomenclature.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of definitions and I can't cover all of them here. You might want to have a look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Definitions\" rel=\"nofollow\">this wiki page<\/a>. The previous link lists the most common properties we think about when thinking about the definition of life.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homeostasis<\/strong>: Regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature.\nOrganization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells \u2014 the basic units of life.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Metabolism<\/strong>: Transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (catabolism). Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.[49]\nGrowth: Maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adaptation<\/strong>: The ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors.\nResponse to stimuli: A response can take many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reproduction<\/strong>: The ability to produce new individual organisms, either asexually from a single parent organism, or sexually from two parent organisms,\"with an error rate below the sustainability threshold.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Related questions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The question of whether viruses are alive is a very common one.

Simple tubular uterine glands reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply of spiral arteries... Proliferation is induced by estrogen (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by progesterone from the corpus luteum (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the embryo. In the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become ischaemic and die, leading to menstruation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, menstrual \"blood\" is a combination of sloughed off stromal and glandular tissue, broken down vascular cells and blood, and, no, it is not highly oxygenated (it's kind of darker than normal blood.

Looking at the Double Restriction Digest, you can see that the five fragments add up to 14kb, which implies that there are only one of each fragment in the plasmid, and they are produced by 5 separate cuts.\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is an important piece of information because this tells you that you do not have 2 fragments of the same size making up different parts of the plasmid.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that when you do a restriction digest on a circular piece of DNA, the number of fragment you get equals the number of cuts (restriction sites) in the plasmid. So because there were 5 fragments, you have 5 separate restriction sites<\/li>\n<li>From the Double Digest data, you also know that the smallest fragment of DNA that you have is 1kb and the largest is 4kb.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Since the 4kb site is common to both the BamHI only and the the Double Digest, as since you do not have a 0.5kb or 1.5kb fragment (the remainders if the Double Digest 4kb fragment had been produced from the 4.5kb or 5.5kb fragments in the BamHI digest) in the Double Digest, you know that the 4kb fragment is the same in both the BamHI digest and the Double Digest, and is produced by 2 BamHI cuts.\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can now work on roughly placing where the 4kb fragment should be in the map.<\/li>\n<li>If you try to place that 4kb fragment in the vector, then you would either generate a 2kb fragment, or something less than 2kb and a very small fragment.<\/li>\n<li>Since you do not have a 2kb fragment or fragments smaller than 1kb, you know that it cannot be in the vector region. Also in order to get a 2kb fragment from the 6kb vector the 4kb fragment would have needed to be cut once with EcoRI and from the description, above, we worked out that the 4kb fragment is produced by two BamHI cuts<\/li>\n<li>It could have been that the vector was 1kb + 4kb + 1kb, however from point 4 you determined that you only had one of each fragment, so you can't have two 1kb fragments.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>All of that tells you that it has to be in the 8kb gene portion, though you need some more information to determine exactly where. \n\n<ul>\n<li>Remember that you do know that the 4kb fragment was produced by 2 BamHI cuts, which means that it cannot be at the very end of the gene region, as that would require it to be cut once with EcoRI<\/li>\n<li>This also tells you that you have at least two BamHI cut sights in the gene.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>What I would do here is draw two circles, the first having an 8kb arc and a 6kb arc, then draw second circle and make three cuts in it. \n\n<ul>\n<li>From 6 we worked out that the 4kb piece will overlap somewhere in the 8kb area, that it cannot be at an end and that there need to be <strong>2 BamHI<\/strong> restriction sites within the gene. <\/li>\n<li>You also have to consider the 4.5kb and 5.5kb parts from the BamHI digest. Since 4kb plus either of those two are greater than 8kb, then you know that the cut that separates 4.5kb from 5.5kb will be somewhere in the 6kb vector. This is how you know that the third BamHI site is in the vector.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Now that you have determine that the 4kb fragment is in the gene you can start to work out the other pieces.<\/li>\n<li>You had 2 fragments from the BamHI digest that were 5.5kb and 4.5kb and in the double digest you have fragments that are 1.0kb, 2.5kb, 3.0kb, and 3.5kb.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since you have already determine that that 4kb piece is the same for both digests, then at this point you can tell yourself that the 1.0kb and 3.5kb fragments made up the 4.5kb fragments and the 2.5kb and 3.0kb fragments made up the 5.5kb fragment.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Since you know that there has to be two EcoRI cuts that make the 6kb fragment, you are going to need two fragments that add up to 6kb.\n\n<ul>\n<li>The only way to get this with the four fragments that you have from the double digest is with the 2.5kb piece and the 3.5 kb piece.<\/li>\n<li>So you have now determined the exact position of one of the BamHI cut sites. It is in the Vector, 2.5kb from one of the EcoRI sites and 3.5kb from the other EcoRI sites.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Now that you determined where one of the sites is, you know that the 2.5kb fragment was paired with the 3.0kb fragment, so this tells you that there is a BamHI site 3kb away from the EcoRI site in the Gene.<\/li>\n<li>From there you can connect the 4.0kb piece to the end of the 3.0kb piece because you know that the 3.5kb piece has to be attached to the 1kb piece and cannot be attached to the 3kb piece.<\/li>\n<li>All that is left is to close the circle. You know that you have 1.0kb more of the gene that needs to be place and this will connect the 7.0kb that you determine of the gene in step 11 to the 3.5kb fragment in the vector. You have that 1.0kb fragment, and that is the one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So that is how you determine how to construct the plasmid map from the restriction digests.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What the distances between the cut sites tell you<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The cut sites are determined by the sequence of the DNA that the Restriction Enzyme recognizes. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>EcoRI recognizes GAATTC<\/li>\n<li>BamHI recognizes GGATCC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You will notice that these are palindromic sequences, so 5'-GAATTC-3' is 3'-CTTAAG-5' on the complimentary strand. <\/p>\n\n<p>All that the distances are telling you is that in the areas in between the cut sites, the sequences GAATTC and GGATCC do not appear. If they did, then the Restriction Endonuclease would recognize that position and cut the DNA, and you would have an additional cut site at that location.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Assuming that you were given the plasmid map, this should be the answer.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The answer should be <strong>C<\/strong>.

Then you digest those with another enzyme, but the pieces that came from the vector should add up to 6, and the pieces that came from the gene should add up to 8.  The 2.5 and 3.5 long pieces must be the cut up vector, the rest must be the cut up gene.  There is no other way to group pieces of those lengths into 6 kb and 8 kb parent fragments.<\/p>\n\n<p>To find the order of them all:<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, you have the 5 smaller fragments, and you want to put them in the right linear order, like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>enzyme - DNA of some size - enzyme - DNA of some size - enzyme ...etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>We know that there is 6 kb Eco RI fragment, and THEN we cut with Bam, so there have to be Bam fragments that add up to 6, and the rest will add up to 8.

There is no fragment that size, so that's not right.  Same with the 3.0 kb fragment.  So, it must be the 1.0 kb fragment, because that would yield the 4.5 kb fragment that we do see.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eco - 2.5 kb - Bam - 3.5 - Eco - 1.0 - Bam ??? Bam ???

However, the degree to which a gene is expressed can vary tremendously. <em>\"Degree of expression\"<\/em> basically means the number of times the gene is read by the transcription machinery, which (generally) correlates to the number of copies of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">mRNA<\/a> present in the cell, which (generally) correlates with the number of protein molecules being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28biology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">translated<\/a>. Essentially, the <em>degree of expression<\/em> of a gene corresponds to how much of the gene's product is being produced.

All nucleated cells express <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">housekeeping genes<\/a> that are required for the normal function of the cells. These are often involved in maintaining metabolism in the cell, sensing and processing nutrients, maintaining the cell's structure and shape, etc. These genes are expressed to a very high degree, meaning they are always \"on\" and being transcribed. On the other hand, there are many many genes that are not needed in \"normal\" situations, and are only turned on at certain points in development, during pathology, during a certain point of the cell cycle, or other similar situations. These genes have a very low degree of expression, and in fact may be turned off altogether in some cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, the degree of expression can be described as the rate at which the gene is being transcribed. In a study like the one illustrated in your question, the number of copies of each gene's mRNA in the cell is quantitated, and compared to the expression of a housekeeping gene that should have the same degree of expression regardless of the sample. The relative amounts of each mRNA are then compared among individuals, and scored accordingly.

If u googled it, there is a scientific review in 2008 that describes this structure. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the embryonic stage (in humans), we still retain our RBC nuclei. But as we developed into fetus and adult, we no longer have RBC nuclei. This is thought to be related to the EBI present (in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow respectively). Currently, there is a lack of information of the EBI in other mammals. The only proven ones are mice, rats and sick humans. It is widely assumed (not proven) that mammals have EBIs. Besides mammals, some other animals (e.g. birds) have enucleated RBC, and some dont. It is unclear why is it so. Our lab thinks that it might be related to the formation of the EBI. <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to engulfing the RBC nuclei, it is believed that the macrophage acts as a \"nurse\" cell as proposed in the 50s. In other words, possibly providing iron, and possibly providing some proteins required for young RBC to mature. In early 2013, for the first time, it was showed that these macrophages are important in animal models(published by 2 research groups in nature medicine journal). <\/p>\n\n<p>As for enucleation (the removal of erythroid nuclei), the exact mechanisms are unknown. But cytoskeleton proteins are important players in enucleation. However, there isnt enough information, as these proteins are essential for other important cellular activities as well. For example, bringing in nutrients, development and cellular migration. Most animal models that lack these proteins are unavailable for studies, and these animals usually die at the embryonic stage. <\/p>\n\n<p>The research mentioned by EdoDodo is a proposed model on how enucleation takes place, and is a widely accepted model. Currently, our lab are working on another model that could partially explain how enucleation is being triggered.<\/p>\n\n<p>Advantages of enucleation:\nIn addition to better oxygen diffusion across the membranes, some older scientific papers mentioned that it lightened the cardiac workload. Each extruded RBC nuclei is approximately 40 picograms. A normal healthy adult individual would produce about 2 million RBC per second. That would be 0.08 milligrams of weight per second are required to be removed. However, I couldnt trace the scientific evidence for this claim, but this have been cited by some scientific papers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other advantage would be to reduce risk of hemolysis when transversing through the microvasculature. In other words, mature RBC can move along tiny blood capillaries by changing their biconcave shape (to bell-shaped I think), so that they will not rupture (and die).<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>P.S. I forgot to add that, not all RBCs have similar shapes and sizes. You might want to google it for more information. I think camels have slightly different RBC morphology.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14491,"question_id":1037,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1389850005},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKCZP.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5444,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5444/starkers","reputation":109,"display_name":"Starkers"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":0,"post_id":14506,"edited":false,"creation_date":1416158558,"comment_id":38230,"body":"The relationship between carrying more oxygen per cell and surface area does not follow logically to me.

Now recognize that this is happening at multiple genes across the entire genome, so there are many chances to get non-parent-like allele combinations. Add to this the issue of co-dominance, where the heterozygote has a different phenotype than either homozygote (that is, <em>BB<\/em> isn't like <em>Bb<\/em>), and the chances that an offspring has a gene with a non-parent like allele combination is pretty high. <\/p>\n\n<p>There's a further complication that some apple varieties like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycrisp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honeycrisp<\/a> are self-sterile. Even if Honeycrisp could theoretically breed true, there's no way for it to fertilize itself, meaning that all fertilization events are hybridizations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you can certainly grow apple trees from seed. The planted seed will grow up into an apple tree, but the chances are that the combination of alleles it received by random chance from its parents will not result in an genotype that produces any commecial apple phenotype. Instead, you're likely to get <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean\" rel=\"nofollow\">regression to the mean<\/a>, meaning the apple tree will be like the ancestor of apples - a crab apple, or at least crab apple-like. - But there's a small chance that it will have commercial apple-like properties, which may or may not be like the parent. This is how new apple varieties are formed, after all.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only way to guarantee that the genotype of an apple tree is close to the parent plant is to propagate it by cloning, and the easiest and cheapest way to clone trees (at least apple trees) is by grafting.<\/p>\n\n<p>(As a final note, remember that the seeds get their genome from the flowers and the cells which produced the flowers. The genotype of the rootstock - grafted or not grafted - has no bearing on what genes are present in the seeds. You'd have the same issue with apples breeding true even if the parent tree was on its own rootstock.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":38788,"question_id":38757,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04c4eae52c6418d74db3c2007e0bd1a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":19299,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19299/brian","reputation":1,"display_name":"Brian"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1444495658,"creation_date":1444495658,"body":"<p>Grafting is not always the answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>My persimmon grafting was successful, but the produced fruit is the fruits of the stock (from seedling), not the scion, when I used the own seeds from the scion; while the same scion is grafted onto a wild persimmon stock, it produces desired fruits of scion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's say: A is grafted persimmon imported from Asia\n           B is stock grown from the seed of fruit of A\nWhen A (scion out of A) is grafted onto B, the fruit is different from A. \nBut, when A is grafted on wild American persimmon, the fruit is the same as A.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39446,"question_id":38757,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38757/why-dont-the-apples-seeds-from-grafted-trees-produce-the-same-kind-of-apples","last_activity_date":1444495658,"creation_date":1442241592,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why don't the apples seeds from grafted trees produce the same kind of apples?","body":"<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a> says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Grafting is a horticultural technique whereby tissues from one plant are inserted into those of another so that the two sets of vascular tissues may join together. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>In most cases, one plant is selected for its roots and this is called the stock or rootstock.

Most somatic cells are terminally differentiated and mitotically inactive, so they are not called upon to replicate their DNA and divide. And when they do, their telomeres get shorter due to the 3' end replication problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>The end replication problem arises due to the biochemical limitations of DNA Polymerase. Pol requires a primer, 5' to 3', in order to bind to the template strand and begin to catalyze the elongation reaction. So when DNA Polymerase gets to the 3' end of the template strand, it is unable to catalyze the reaction because it doesn't have a free 3' hydroxyl. When the end RNA primer that was used to catalyze the Okazaki fragment just before the 3' end is removed, there is no place left on the template strand to prime, so there is no 3' hydroxyl to begin the elongation reaction and you are left with a 3' overhang of single-stranded DNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the 5' end of the Template Strand, even though the polymerase is able to catalyze the reaction all the way to the end, the end of the chromosome is processed and nucleotides are removed to make a single-stranded 3' overhang on this end. The overhangs are necessary to do strand invasion to form the T-Loops of the telomeres. So every time a chromosome in a cell that has inactive telomerase replicates, it gets shorter.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the cell types that have telomerase actively express, such as lymphocytes, partially-differentiated stem cells, and the precursor cells to sperm, there is a negative feedback loop based on the length of the telomeres, which in turn regulates the activity of telomerase. Telomerase maintains the ends of the chromosomes, especially in these mitotically active cells, but it will only elongate them to a certain point.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It has long been known that telomere length is regulated by a negative feedback loop (reviewed in Smogorzewska and de Lange, 2004). Long telomeres contain more negative regulators that limit further telomere elongation by telomerase. Because of this, the enzyme preferentially acts on the shortest telomeres in the cell (Hemann et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 1998).\n  <strong>- Loayza, et. al.; Cell; Volume 117, Issue 3 30 April 2004<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":39405,"question_id":39402,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1444403316}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39402/why-doesnt-telomerase-activity-cause-dna-to-get-longer-each-time-a-cell-undergo","last_activity_date":1444455333,"creation_date":1444350432,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why doesn't telomerase activity cause DNA to get longer each time a cell undergoes DNA replication?","body":"<p>Telomerase extends the ends of the lagging strands in order for all of DNA to be be copied.

We only use the molecules of oxygen $O_2$ from the air (which takes ~20% of the total volume). This molecule goes in the blood, reach the cells and react with sugar to produce energy. The waster of this reaction is another molecule $CO_2$ that needs to be exhaled through the lungs.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, really the volume and of air that we have in our lungs doesn't vary much (It actually increase a little bit as we had some carbons). Only the composition of the air that we have in our lungs changes. After some time, we need to renew this air and for this purpose we first need to breath out the air that is contain a high density of $CO_2$ before breathing in.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is why when sticking the head out of the water many people first breath out and then breath in. Note, however that one can breath out all its air underwater and then only has to breath in when back at the surface.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Are you asking why do we contract our lips during sport?<\/p>\n\n<p>If yes, I think it very much depend from one person to another.

The other option is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field\" rel=\"nofollow\">far-field<\/a> or radiative technology, where either visible light (from lasers) or microwaves are used.

Their safety in general will depend mainly on the power being transmitted. For example, a laser can be destructive if it is powerful enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>I will focus on inductive coupling, because it is not only safe, it is commonplace. The prime example being <a href=\"http://www.advancedbionics.com/com/en/products/hires_90k_implant.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cochlear implants<\/a>. Cochlear implants are basically electrode arrays implanted in the inner ear to directly electrically stimulate the auditory nerve in deaf people where the hair cells have degenerated (or were never there). The implant is powered by an external battery worn behind the ear. It is coupled to a head-worn external coil that wirelessly transfers the power needed to drive the implant to an internal, surgically implanted coil. I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers, but more than 100,000 folks around the globe have received one or two cochlear implants. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M018n.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M018n.jpg\" alt=\"CI\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Cochlear implant showing the external and internal coil to transcranially transmit power to the implant.Source: <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/electronics/139875-mit-devises-biobattery-that-could-allow-the-human-ear-to-power-its-own-hearing-aid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Technology<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Very similar technology is used in retinal implants.

So this is how Cortisol maintains the body weight normally if our body gets enough exercise or has proper metabolism.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whereas in Cushing' syndrome which comes usually by taking glucocorticoid drugs, or diseases that result in excess cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or CRH levels. In this case Cortisol content will be more than the normal level which in turn requires more carbohydrate. So cortisol metabolizes the food and reefuels the body even when there is no requirement within the body. So because of excessive cortisol content body simply gets excessive fat accumulated in various parts which mainly results in obesity.<\/p>\n\n<p>One more explanation from <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/stress-and-obesity-101-what-are-the-effects-of-stress-induced-cortisol-on-obesity\" rel=\"nofollow\">High level of Cortisol effects<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chronically high levels of cortisol plays a big role in the development of obesity.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>Cortisol helps the body handle stress; so, when stress goes up,\n  cortisol also goes up. Cortisol stimulates fat and carbohydrate\n  metabolism during stressful situations. This leads to increased blood\n  sugar levels required for fast energy. In turn, this stimulates\n  insulin release which can lead to an increase in appetite.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote><\/li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>Adrenaline increases alertness and metabolism by helping fat cells release\n  energy. When the immediate stress is over, the adrenaline levels\n  return to normal. But, cortisol lingers to help bring the body back\n  into balance after stress. One of the ways it gets things back to\n  balance is by increasing appetite to replace the carbohydrate and fat\n  used for the flight or fight response.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem is that in today's society, stress-causing situations do\n  not really require the body to use up a lot of energy. So, cortisol\n  ends up causing the body to refuel after stress even when it doesn't\n  really need to refuel. This excess fuel or glucose is converted into\n  fat resulting in increased storage of fat.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":10780,"question_id":10779,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o_whZRPQtlI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/oiuXQ0o3UcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":19270,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19270/taher-tinwala","reputation":1,"display_name":"Taher Tinwala"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":39414,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444374319,"comment_id":65977,"body":"Can you please add some references?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o_whZRPQtlI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/oiuXQ0o3UcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":19270,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19270/taher-tinwala","reputation":1,"display_name":"Taher Tinwala"},"score":0,"post_id":39414,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1444381559,"comment_id":65978,"body":"<a href=\"http://www.3fatchicks.com/how-cushings-syndrome-can-contribute-to-weight-gain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3fatchicks.com/&hellip;<\/a>"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1444374229,"creation_date":1444374229,"body":"<p>I read this somewhere.

It is likely the proteins in a peanut that cause an allergy, and that is not what you are inhaling, and as for the vegetarian, I think the justification is that it would be the protein that constitutes the consumption of a meat and not the molecules that come from the cooked or uncooked tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to broaden what you are calling metabolize, then you would only need to look at inhaled medicines such as corticosteroids or compounds to bronchodilate, to make a case for the fact that you are metabolizing what you inhale.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39411,"question_id":39410,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39410/does-the-human-body-metabolize-what-it-smells-even-in-trace-amounts","last_activity_date":1444367734,"creation_date":1444361862,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does the human body metabolize what it smells, even in trace amounts?","body":"<p>I conjectured to a friend that some small amount of anything we smell is likely metabolized by the body.

An allele or a trait can be evolutionarily advantageous if it increases the fitness of its carrier. If an allele, an evolutionary process or an environmental change decreases the risk of extinction for a species, then you cannot talk about evolutionary advantage. Selection (whether natural, sexual, artificial or whatever) does not (necessarily) minimize the risk of extinction of species.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/239/is-there-any-evidence-that-sexual-selection-may-lead-to-extinction-of-species\">This post<\/a> is very related to your question and is definitely worth reading.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I hope your teacher didn't really say that! Assuming he did say that, then know that it is really not as easy as he's suggesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of studies that address the question on whether <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sexual Selection<\/a> (SS) and Natural Selection (NS) have opposite or antagonist effects. The subject is not easy and as SS is not my field of expertise my answer will not be complete. I will talk about two possible hypotheses for explaining the existence of SS and what they mean in terms of probability of extinction.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Genes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Under the \"<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1512494/good-genes-hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good Gene<\/a>\" hypothesis, females' preference (we'll assume that females are choosy but there are many species where males are choosy) of some traits evolve because those traits are correlated with the global health of the male. In consequence, by choosing a male carrying some trait, the female makes sure that her offsrping will receive good genes from their father. This hypothesis assumes that poor males cannot produce fancy phenotype, while good males can. This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zahavi's Handicap Principle<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under this hypothesis, if a trait become too costly for a given male, the male will just die, therefore limiting the evolution of secondary sexual traits. As a result, the population will no get extinct. Furthermore, under this hypothesis, SS may actually increase the effect of NS making sure that only the best male reproduce. In results the mean absolute fitness of the population should increase faster in a population where \"Good gene\"-SS occurs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sexy Son<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Females preference for some trait may also evolve because mating with a sexy male means having sexy sons. This is called the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_son_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">sexy son<\/a>\" hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under this hypothesis, again if a sexy male has a low enough survival, then a female has better to mate with a less sexy male (even though her offspring won't be very sexy) so to increase the survival of her offspring. After a bunch of generations, all females will end up preference mating with non-sexy male, changing the concept of what we call sexy in this population and therefore reversing the effects of SS.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may also want to read about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fisher's runaway processes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Just an article among others<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Aneil Agrawal has some nice articles on SS that may interest you. <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(11)01397-2?cc=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> for example discusses how sexual antagonist genes influence whether SS has an antagonist or parallel effect to NS.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is SS really different from NS?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your question <code>Why natural selection did not eliminate sexual selection?<\/code> assumes that NS and SS are two different things! This is a very old-style point of view. Charles Darwin coined these two terms thinking of two, unrelated processes. Today, most authors see SS as being part of NS (if a chestnut tree is a type of tree, SS is a type of NS). And many of the processes that are termed SS has actually not much to do with \"competition to access a mate\" but only has to do with NS. For example, many people talk about SS when talking about sexually antagonist genes or sexual conflicts. In short, the concepts are kind a mixed up. You may want to read about the work of Hannah Kokko about the semantics of terms related to SS.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24623,"question_id":24618,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1444335472}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24618/is-sexual-selection-evolutionarily-advantageous","last_activity_date":1444335472,"creation_date":1417883216,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is sexual selection evolutionarily advantageous?","body":"<p>Our biology teacher says that peacocks will soon become extinct because of bigger and bigger (and heavier and heavier) tails.

Here is one: One can approximate the probability of fixation of new mutations (using diffusion equations) with <\/p>\n\n<p>$$P_{fix}≈\\frac{1-e^{-4Ns} }{1-e^{-4s}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>, where $s$ is the selection coefficient and $N$ is the populations size. As you can see, a larger population size (the lowest is the genetic drift) corresponds to a higher probability of fixation of a beneficial mutation (to reach frequency of 1 in the population). If you don't have a good intuition of why genetic drift is inversely proportional to the population size, please have a look at <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a>. The most important point to keep in mind about the effect of drift is that when <strong>drift is high, every mutation pretty much behaves like neutral mutations<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This approximation is accurate under some assumption, for instance that the population is panmictic (=random mating). This equation holds true regardless of the reasons why a mutation affects fitness. The mutation may affect the activity level of an enzyme or it may influence how attractive an individual is to the other sex. So yes, in any case, a beneficial mutation may fix although it is deleterious (because of drift), or it may not fix although it is beneficial (because of drift).<\/p>\n\n<p>A mutation might be beneficial in both sexes, detrimental in both sexes or beneficial in one sex and not in the other. In such cases, I suppose it is possible that the above equation must take a slightly different form. In any case where the mutation has a different impact on the fitness in each gender, I don't know how the above formulation would solve to but I'd think that you could simply replace $s$, by $\\frac{s_m+s_f}{2}$, that is the average of the effect in both sexes (where $s_m$ and $s_f$ are the selection coefficients in males and females respectively). Intuitively, I think this should hold true as long as the sex-ratio is 1:1. The exact calculation of the probability of fixation doesn't matter to your question though. Note that mutations having the opposite effect on fitness in each gender often end up being on sexual chromosomes (if any) or at least being expressed in one sex but not in the other. In such case, a fixed mutation often end up being beneficial in one sex while neutral in the other. In any case, genetic drift will obviously affect the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>could you clarify \"As you can see the highest is the population size (the lowest is the genetic drift),\"?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The impact of genetic drift can be measured in terms of how it affects probability of fixation or how it affects the rate at which heterozygosity at a neutral site is lost.

We tried to present every T-shirt as often to MHC-dissimilar women as to MHC-similar women (average difference of presentations to thc two groups: -0.02, s.d. = 0.73). The presentation was random in every other respect [...]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather irritatingly, although the study design involved asking women to rate at least three attributes of the smells (sexiness, pleasantness, and intensity) the study performs a bait-and-switch in its results:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The scores for sexiness are not shown in the figures as they were highly correlated with pleasantness (all scorings: r = 0.85, n =  294; for women who do not take the pill: r = 0.87, n = 186; for women who take the pill : r = 0.83, n = 108, p always &lt;&lt; 0.001)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a bait-and-switch because <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5747/if-a-and-b-are-correlated-with-c-why-are-a-and-b-not-necessarily-correlated\">even if A correlates with C, and B correlates with C, we do not know that A and B correlate with each other<\/a>. Of the three measured attributes, 'sexiness' arguably has the most direct bearing on mate-choice. Because analysis for 'sexiness' is not presented, the paper ends up telling us much less than it could have about the relationship between MHC relatedness and mate choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>The results for 'pleasantness' and 'intensity' look like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XLPoS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XLPoS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>One further piece of analysis is presented: some number of the female subjects seem to have reported that particular smells reminded them of their partner or ex-partner; or reminded them of family members. Mentioning that a shirt smelled like a partner or ex-partner happened more frequently for MHC-dissimilar shirt smells (~17% vs ~9%; p = 0.038, two-tailed Fisher exact test). Oddly, no written response-collection is described in the methods, so I can only assume that these assessments were ad-hoc.<\/p>\n\n<p>If this was all of the analysis that had been done on the topic, my assessment would be: this is amongst <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\" rel=\"nofollow\">the many published research findings that are probably false<\/a>.

In this study:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] we did not distinguish between, in our statistical analysis, women who were taking oral contraceptives from women who were not.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[...] Nine female participants (31.03% of female subjects) were taking oral contraceptives.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sample sizes are smaller than Wedekind 1995 in terms of number of participants, but larger in terms of number of contrasts, because this experiment had two different sample types (sweat odour and urine), and had men smelling women as well as women smelling men. Within-individual effects are not modelled, so there is a potential for (e.g.) a small number of generically good-smelling individuals with rare MHC alleles at the population level to bias the analyses - whereas this potential bias was accounted for in Wedekind by performing within-individual correlations. The sample-sizes look like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1oUpk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1oUpk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The analysis was a series of Chi-squared tests, for data collected in four different sessions: one with men smelling female urine, one with men smelling female body odour, one with women smelling male urine, and one with women smelling male body odour. All chi-squared tests returned non-significant results with the exception of women smelling male body odour, for which the Chi-squared table looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/813Vw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/813Vw.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So, this study didn't find the same result as the Wedekind study, but then, it <em>couldn't<\/em> find the same thing as the Wedekind study because of the way the analysis was performed, so that is no surprise. The authors claim that they found a significant effect of MHC relatedness on odour perception, but only in the proportions in the hard-to-interpret 'indifferent' response category. I am inclined to disagree. The authors presumably conducted 16 contrasts (a test of independence and three goodness-of-fit tests in each of four treatment types), and found one instance of p &lt; 0.05. I would argue that the one 'significant' result is best explained as a failure to account for multiple comparisons.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ending notes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If these two papers were the only things that had been published on MHC-directed mate preferences in humans, I would be far from convinced that the claimed effects were real.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>however...<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>These are far from the only papers on the subject of MHC-driven mate-choice in humans. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1688704/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wedekind and Füri (1997)<\/a> conducted an analysis with very similar experimental design to Wedekind et al (1995), but arguably better statistical analysis, and found the same direction of association as Wedekind et al (1995), albeit still with a fairly high noise-to-signal ratio. Subjectively, this goes a reasonable distance towards making me think that the findings of Wedekind et al (1995) were not just a statistical fluke. I'm still not utterly convinced, but certainly more convinced than I would be if Wedekind's final paper on the topic had been the 1995 publication.<\/p>\n\n<p>MHC-driven mate-choice has also been investigated using facial preferences and mate choice surveys.

After reaching the age of about 20 years the average number of fat cells is closely related to body mass index. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the adipocytes in children increase in number as more fat is consumed. This explains why people who became fat as children have a harder time shifting their weight as adults.<\/p>\n\n<p>A study on obese adults who went through surgery to decrease the amount of food intake showed a reduction in their body weight by 18%. While the average size of the fat cells decreased, the number of fat cells remained the same. <\/p>\n\n<p>This doesn't mean that the same fat cells are active throughout your lifetime. Adipocytes normally die off and are replaced by new cells. One study shows that fat obtained from liposuction of people who were exposed to radioactive materials from atomic bombs in the Cold War showed a decrease in radioactive material stored in the cells which indicates replenishment of fat cells over the years.<\/p>\n\n<p>So when adults intake excess fat, their fat cells increase in size.

Inbreeding tends to breed homozygosity, so as you said, if you have a recessive disease causing allele within a bloodline, then even if only one of the founders was a heterozygous carrier, then inbreeding can give rise to afflicted homozygotes. However, for lab strains, it is actually desirable to use completely inbred lines where all animals are as near to 100% identical (from a DNA sequence perspective) as you can get. This makes genetic mutational analysis far easier (possible).<\/p>\n\n<p>It also depends on the alleles in question. Not every mutation is purely dominant or purely recessive. You can have situations, such as with some tumor suppressor genes, that diversifying the population by outbreeding to someone with a functional tumor suppressor, will still cause the offspring to have only a single working allele, and therefore an increased probability that they can sustain a random mutation that will knock the working gene out. You can also have cases where having one functional copy of the gene isn't enough, so the offspring are haploinsufficient. You need two doses of both working copies of an allele to display the non-afflicted phenotype, though the afflicted heterozygote has a better time of it that the afflicted homozygote, who has none of the working allele.<\/p>\n\n<p>You also have X-Linked conditions. If the maternal lineage is inbred, then all of the males will be afflicted and females will be carriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that the outside breeder is a carrier of the mutant allele so the offspring remain homozygous or the outside breeder has an allele of the gene that comes with its own defect. They may not be afflicted, as they could be heterozygous for a working copy, but their offspring with the inbred line could be heterozygous afflicted because neither of the alleles they inherit are functional, it is just that they are not functional in different ways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sexual reproductions main advantage is that it is supposed to increase diversity in the population and increase survivability of the species. When you have isolated populations or inbreeding by choice, then this can circumvents the benefits.

One confusion in the OP is that there is no real meaning for a chemical equilibrium <em>between<\/em> carbon dioxide and oxygen, as they are separate chemical entities. Carbon dioxide in the lung capillary blood equilibrates with carbon dioxide in the lung alveolar gas; oxygen similarly equilibrates between blood and gas. Each effectively on its own.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, oxygen is continually being consumed and carbon dioxide being produced by the body, so from that perspective we have a whole body steady state. At overall equilibrium we are dead. But at the site of gas exchange in the lung, there is generally no difference in the chemical activity of either gas between the alveolar air and the capillary blood leaving the alveolus. So from a chemical perspective there is generally local equilibrium of both gases at that point.<\/p>\n\n<p>In some circumstances this local equilibrium is not reached. The transport of carbon dioxide is very complicated, as it exists in several inter-convertible forms: dissolved carbon dioxide gas, a form called carbonic acid where it has chemically reacted with water, the bicarbonate and carbonate ions that come from dissociation of carbonic acid, and a carbamate form that is a reversible chemical bond with amino groups on proteins. The reaction with water is slow on its own; it is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in red cells. If that enzyme is inhibited (for example, by the drug acetazolamide) then there might not be chemical equilibrium of <em>total<\/em> carbon dioxide between alveolar air and capillary blood as there might not be enough time, as blood flows through the alveolus, for all the other forms to convert to the dissolved gas that can diffuse from blood into alveolar air.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another complication is that transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood are somewhat interdependent. Acidification by carbon dioxide (lower <em>pH<\/em> is more acid) affects the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen, tending to release more oxygen. Nevertheless, in most circumstances in humans, both gases are individually at equilibrium between alveolar air and the blood that leaves the alveolus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the continued presence of carbon dioxide in the body is a normal, healthy part of physiologic functioning.

The way tattoos work is that Macrophages in the skin phagocytose the heavy metals in the inks. Because the heavy metals do not interact with Toll-like receptors, or any of the other pathogen receptors that macrophages have on their cell surface, they do not induce a transcriptional signal into the nucleus of the macrophage to induce it to chemotax out of the dermal tissue and into the lymphatic system, so they just sit there.

As graphite is pure carbon, I wouldn't worry that much about it, but it is also not not in a form that the body can use, so it will persist.

For the sake of clarity I assume you are talking dB sound pressure level, or <strong><a href=\"http://www.acoustic-glossary.co.uk/sound-pressure.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">dB SPL<\/a><\/strong>, which is a unit of sound pressure relative to a standard sound pressure of 20 µPa and widely used. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The damaging effects depend on the sound pressure received by the ear. Whether this is a compound signal or a single source doesn't matter. Like whether you crash your car against a wall at 80 mph, or head's on against a truck both travelling at 40 mph - it doesn't really matter. It's the <em>mechanical<\/em> energy transferred to the hair cells that counts.  <\/li>\n<li>A one-shot noise... I don't really understand what you're aiming at, but as said above, it's the raw sound pressure that counts. Further, prolonged exposure is definitely more damaging than a short exposure. However, when the sound pressure is strong enough, e.g. a bomb blast which lasts just a fraction of a second, hearing can still be permanently lost provided the sound level is high enough.   <\/li>\n<li>According to the <a href=\"http://www.earcentergreensboro.com/medical-education/noise_exposure/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ear Center of Greensboro<\/a>, a rule of thumb is that the maximal safe exposure to sound of 100 dB is half an hour, and for every added 5 dB that time is cut in half. Thus, for 120 db that would add up to 7.5 minutes before permanent damage occurs. The safe loudness limit per day has primarily been established in terms of maximum sound levels for <strong>occupational exposures<\/strong> (i.e., sound exposure for 5 days per week, 8 hours per day). Likely it is dependent on where you live, but here in <a href=\"http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/Documents/278/NationalStandardForOccupationalNoise_NOHSC1007-2000_PDF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australia, the Government<\/a> has set the safe occupational limit to <strong>85 dBA<\/strong>. The <a href=\"http://www.hearforever.org/tools-to-learn/sound-source-a-and-c-weighted-noise-measurements\" rel=\"nofollow\">dB(A)<\/a> is a weighted unit of loudness that is corrected for the hearing sensitivity of the human ear. <\/li>\n<li>The labyrinth of the inner ear is a system of interconnected chambers and canals.

Ig,\n  Immunoglobulin.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most interesting to me is the removal of the 3ed sentence: \"Comparable differences in the origins of these subsets have not been defined in humans.\" Which leads me to believe that comparable differences in the origins of these subsets <strong>have now<\/strong> been defined in humans (in the past 4 years).<\/p>\n\n<p>So I have a definition and description of follicular B cells, but I am unable to find anything else in either edition of this book on the <strong>development<\/strong> of follicular B cells (in either mouse or human).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another reference in my course resources is <em>Cellular and Molecular Immunology<\/em>, 8th ed., 2014, by Abbas, Lichtman, and Pillai.<\/p>\n\n<p>In it (Chapter 12: B cell activation and Antibody Production), I find the following about follicular B cells:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Distinct subsets of B cells respond preferentially to different types of antigens<\/strong> ( Fig. 12-3 ). Follicular B cells in peripheral\n  lymphoid organs primarily make antibody responses to protein antigens\n  that require collaboration with helper T cells.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Which strikes me as yet another description of follicular B cells, but not a list of steps in their development (which is my learning objective).<\/p>\n\n<p>The same textbook makes several other mentions of follicular B cells, but does not address their development. Although I should probably already know this (and this may be in some of my lectures but these are not universally searchable and I have precious little time to read), I do not know about either their progenitors or their progeny, and I think this is what is meant by this learning objective: the major steps in their development.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the same chapter of the same textbook, I also see:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most mature naive B lymphocytes are follicular B cells (sometimes also\n  called recirculating B cells) that constantly recirculate in the blood\n  and migrate from one secondary lymphoid organ to the next in search of\n  antigen. Follicular B cells enter secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen,\n  lymph nodes, mucosal lymphoid tissues) through blood vessels located\n  in the T cell zones, and then they migrate into the follicles, the B\n  cell zones of these tissues. The movement into lymphoid follicles is\n  guided by the chemokine CXCL13 secreted by follicular dendritic cells,\n  the major stromal cell type in the follicle, as well as by other\n  stromal cells. CXCL13 binds to the CXCR5 chemokine receptor on the\n  recirculating naive B cells and attracts these cells into the\n  follicles. As we will discuss later, the same chemokine-receptor pair\n  is also important during immune responses because it can attract a\n  subset of activated T cells to the follicle.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems like a great description of the follicular B cell that also delves into its function, but seems to include nothing about its development.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same chapter of the same textbook also includes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Naive follicular B cells survive for limited periods until they\n  encounter antigen (see Chapter 2 ). Follicular B cell survival depends\n  on signals from the BCR as well as on inputs received from a tumor\n  necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily cytokine called BAFF (B\n  cell\u2013activating factor of the TNF family, also known as BLyS, for B\n  lymphocyte stimulator), which provides maturation and survival signals\n  through the BAFF receptor. BAFF and a related ligand, APRIL, can\n  activate two other receptors, TACI and BCMA, which participate in\n  later stages of B cell activation and differentiation (and will be\n  discussed later). These cytokines are produced mainly by myeloid cells\n  in lymphoid follicles and in the bone marrow.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This paragraph briefly address a little bit of what seems like the development of the follicular B cell (\"Follicular B cell survival depends on...\"). And in chapter 2 I see that follicular B cells are a class of B lymphocytes (along with Marginal zone B cells), but I interpret this learning objective as about the development of follicular B cells <strong>after<\/strong> they become follicular B cells, not before this point in their development.<\/p>\n\n<p>So this is the best answer I can find on my own after many hours of searching and reading relevant passages in recent textbooks on the subject. Yet this answer also seems incomplete to me. After all this reading, I still have no \"steps (per se) of follicular B cell development.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>So I could really use a more complete answer.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39248,"question_id":39247,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39247/what-are-the-major-steps-of-follicular-b-cell-development","last_activity_date":1444045182,"creation_date":1443911333,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are the major steps of follicular B cell development","body":"<p>This is a learning objective in my curriculum, and after having spent two hours trying to answer it for myself using official course resources (many of which are online, but some of which are behind paywalls and so may be inaccessible to other community members), it's clear to me that I need some assistance.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I would just like to know what is the latest understanding of the major steps of follicular B cell development in mouse and human.<\/p>\n","question_id":39247,"tags":["immunology"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1444045182},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8mL8.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":989,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/989/hkbattousai","reputation":205,"display_name":"hkBattousai","accept_rate":75},"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user19185"},"score":0,"post_id":8226,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444028323,"comment_id":65723,"body":"Its mostly Hollywood.

After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony (<strong><em>A<\/em><\/strong>), which can last a minimum of 5.5 days), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony (stage <strong><em>B<\/em><\/strong>)). Merozoites leave the liver and enter the circulatory system where they infect red blood cells (<strong><em>5<\/em><\/strong>). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing more merozoites, which continue the cycle of infection of RBCs (<strong><em>6<\/em><\/strong>).

If you are asking (as you did in your comment above) what would happen if a virus with no enzymes were to infect a cell, see below. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of HIV (and other retroviruses) some of the most important enzymes contained in a normal viral particle are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A reverse transcriptase (RT): this enzyme reverse-transcribes the viral RNA genome to cDNA, <\/li>\n<li>An integrase: incorporates the cDNA produced by the RT into the host cell's DNA.<\/li>\n<li>A ribonuclease : an enzyme that can degrade (cut up) RNA. In the case of HIV this is the same protein as the RT.<\/li>\n<li>A protease: an enzyme that can degrade other proteins.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Viruses work by copying their genetic material (their DNA or RNA) into the host cell's genome and then hijacking the cell's replication machinery to make more copies of the virus. So, what would happen if these enzymes were absent? <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Without an integrase, the virus would not be able to insert its reverse transcribed DNA into the cell's genome.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Without an RT, the virus would not be able to copy its RNA into DNA. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The ribonuclease activity is also needed for successful reverse transcription to double stranded DNA (see [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994660\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>] for a review and explanation of why.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The protease is necessary for the formation of new viral particles.

The flip side of this is that everything that is left is essential, the virus cannot function without it.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question, a virus without any enzymes is, essentially, not a virus.

The transgene comprised sequences for two phenotypic markers: kanamycin resistance (npt II) and green fluorescent protein (gfp), expressed from their own bacterial promoters. Recipient bacteria carried a copy of these two genes, with deletions in their 3'-termini abolishing the marker activity, these genes were integrated into a 16S rRNA gene in the bacterial chromosomal genome or carried on a broad host range plasmid. Successful recombination between the plant transgene and the bacterial genome resulted in restoration of the markers, allowing detection through antibiotic selection and fluorescence. Transformation parameters of increasing complexity, without any enrichment steps, were used to approach the field conditions, while still obtaining measurable transformation frequencies. In pure culture filter experiments, transformation was detected using ground, chopped and whole leaves, as well as whole sterile seedlings, and ground roots. In sterile soil microcosms, transformation was detected using <strong>pure plant DNA<\/strong> (3.6 × 10-8 transformants per recipient) and ground leaves (2.5 × 10-11). Transformation was also detected for the first time in non-sterile soil using <strong>pure plant DNA<\/strong> (5.5 × 10-11). Since the same constructs were used throughout, these data allow predictions of even more complex environmental systems where measurable frequencies are not easily obtainable.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the meaning of <strong>pure plant DNA<\/strong>?

So,using ChIP-seq one extracts the dna where H3K4me3 sits via antibodies. After sequencing one obtain reads that are distributed around the H3K4me3 binding site, meaning, one should obtain two peaks of almost the same height (as in TF example).
