For more info check this :  Termites follow the typical life cycle of insects that have a gradual life cycle: they begin as eggs, and then enter nymphal to adult stages. In termite development, newly hatched termites are sometimes referred to as \u201clarvae,\u201d which is not to be confused with the larvae of complete metamorphosis insects like flies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Termite larvae typically hatch within a few weeks. They are approximately the same size as the eggs from which they hatched and are immediately tended to by worker termites. They often comprise a large part of a termite colony.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similar to other insect young, termite larvae go through a series of molts, during which they shed their skins. From the larval stage, termite larvae may evolve into other members of the colony\u2019s castes.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you suspect you have termite activity in or near your home, contact a pest control professional. Termite damage can go undetected and result in significant financial loss from their damage. A termite inspector can inspect a home for signs of activity and conditions that are attractive to termites. They also can offer services to treat and protect the home from potential future damage.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XbcUv.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XbcUv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":38578,"question_id":37498,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37498/what-kind-of-larvae-are-these","last_activity_date":1441614315,"creation_date":1441322508,"answer_count":1,"title":"What kind of larvae are these?","body":"<p>My uncle was helping us spray the garage for ants, and he stumbled across a huge batch of some type of larvae.

The couples that don't reproduce simply don't pass on their genes so evolution \"is favouring\" those couples that don't use contraception. This is a bit tricky because if a couple uses contraception for life and doesn't reproduce at all, they are evolutionary dead ends and selective pressure can't act on them because there isn't anything passed to the next generation. \nFor the couples that use contraception for longer or more often, leading to delayed childbirth or less children born, then the parents would have contributed less genes to the next-generation's gene pool so they may be wiped out more easily.

Mutations in regulatory elements or interacting proteins may also result in hemophilia due to the regulatory elements downregulating the expression or activity of the protein. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Approximately 40% of cases of severe FVIII deficiency arise from a large inversion that disrupts the FVIII gene.

Three categories of lice that get on humans are: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice.  They are related species (possibly the same species in some cases - <a href=\"https://www.insidescience.org/content/are-head-and-body-lice-same-species/550\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.insidescience.org/content/are-head-and-body-lice-same-species/550<\/a>), but each type has their own preference for habitat and feeding.  There are all kinds of reasons for a species to have a preference, and some stick to those preferences quite strongly.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for your mosquitoes, their absolute preferences are still not known but blood seeking insects do have their senses attuned to clues such as carbon dioxide and heat (that help identify potential hosts) as well smells and other influences on their senses.  There might be something special about the side of your right knee as far as mosquito senses go, but not every individual in a species sees, smells, hears, etc. the same way.  My brother has a gene that makes broccoli taste very bitter, but I am fortunate to not have those taste buds.  Color blindness is another example of differences in perception, but even without being color blind, what you see as red is probably not how someone else sees red due to natural variations in the patterns of sensory cells in the eye.  For a consistent pattern of behavior from the mosquitoes, in spite of individual differences we still need to consider another source of variation that might lead to this mosquito preference: the host.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the variation of individual mosquitoes is trumped by a consistent pattern of predation, perhaps the mediating factor is the host.  Your knee could have a special smell, or other sensory flag that attracts mosquitoes.  There are efforts to understand how a mosquito's perception directs who gets bitten: <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/video/future-repellents-mess-with-mosquit2013-12-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/video/future-repellents-mess-with-mosquit2013-12-23/<\/a> .  Not enough is known yet about the preferences of mosquitoes to say for sure what makes your knee so good.  There is also a chance that your knee is not special to the mosquito because it appears the most appetizing.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Host behavior is another possible influence.  The knee is just far enough away from the reach of your hands.  Conscious or absentminded grooming would both be limited at that distance.  The knee may also be better than an ankle or a foot, because of what is worn or because the knee moves less than the lower leg during walking and other movements.  If you are bitten on the lateral (outside) side of your knee, this would add evidence to this hypothesis of your movement influencing mosquito behavior, because the inside of your knee more frequently brushes against the other leg.  The frequency of the inside of the knee being a safe place for a meal is much lower.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for why it's the right knee rather than the left, there is  possibility that that is also a reflection of you, rather than the pests.  Humans display preferences in dominance for both hands and feet.  One side of your body may be selected more often than another because of you being right- or left-handed, or right- or left-footed.  This could affect grooming habits (how you swat at the bugs), how your cross your legs, which side you carry items or lean against other objects which might brush against the body, influence how well you spray yourself with bug repellent or who knows what else.  (Just for curiosity's sake, ¿are you right-handed or are you left-handed?)<\/p>\n\n<p>In short: There's a lot of evidence to collect before we could come to a definitive answer.  There are a lot of possibilities, including that your knee may not be the tastiest spot, but rather a relatively safe spot for dinner.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more unempirical thoughts on the relationship of insects to the lower limbs, please see: <a href=\"http://fishboyridesagain.blogspot.com/2005/11/bugs-and-trousers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fishboyridesagain.blogspot.com/2005/11/bugs-and-trousers.html<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":38522,"question_id":36783,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1441492127}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36783/can-biting-insects-detect-specific-places-on-a-host-body","last_activity_date":1441492127,"creation_date":1439360078,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can Biting Insects Detect Specific Places On A Host Body?","body":"<p>I'm gonna make a presumptive statement: It -seems- as though I get bitten by mosquitos and other biting insects in -exactly- the same places over and over.

Nearly all nuclear divisions (mitosis) and cell divisions\n  (cytokinesis) occur in these meristematic regions. In a young plant, the\n  most active meristems are called apical meristems; they are located at the\n  tips of the stem and the root (see Figure 1.1). At the nodes, axillary buds\n  contain the apical meristems for branch shoots.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The root and shoot apical meristems formed during embryogenesis are called\n  primary meristems. After germination, the activity of these primary\n  meristems generates the primary tissues and organs that constitute the\n  primary plant body.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Most plants also develop a variety of secondary meristems during\n  postembryonic development. Secondary meristems can have a structure similar\n  to that of primary meristems, but some secondary meristems have a quite\n  different structure. These include axillary meristems, inflorescence\n  meristems, floral meristems, intercalary meristems, and lateral meristems.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Axillary buds are secondary meristems; if they are also vegetative meristems, they will have a structure and developmental potential similar to that of the apical meristem. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, briefly, I could say that meristems are localized regions where undifferentiated cells reproduce themselves and originate new plant tissue. Axillary buds contain secondary (formed after embryogenesis) meristems. This meristem can behave like an apical meristem if it becomes vegetative i.e. either apical dominance disappears or it is excised and subcultured elsewhere.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31044,"question_id":31000,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KpAeUa9NyyE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEg/VoOx3aYeiak/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16108/p-jay","reputation":55,"display_name":"P.

So let's take as a given that whatever purpose our hearing serves, what we have ended up with is machinery which can usually tell higher tones from lower tones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, it turns out that this by itself is not a simple problem to solve. Real, natural sound is never a simple sinusoidal wave. If you hear a pure sinusoidal wave played over a speaker, it sounds synthetic, like maybe a pitch fork, a singing bowl, or a computer - definitely something man-made. That's because absolutely nothing natural makes a sound like that. Consider any natural thing that for even a moment holds a single tone, like a long tone from within birdsong, or the long tone at the peak of a wolf's howl, or wind whistling through a cavern. If you heard samples of each at exactly the same pitch, they would still be distinguishable, just as a clarinet is distinguishable from a flute, or in fact, to the trained ear, two clarinets are distinguishable from one another. This is because the wave that reaches your ear is actually much more complex than a simple sine wave.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, if you saw the high-fidelity digital wave representation of almost any sound which we would consider to be a single tone of one steady pitch, you might have a lot of trouble identifying the period of that wave (which correlates to it's pitch). In digital processing, to identify the tone in a digital wave, or for that matter, the many tones represented in a piece of music, we run a complicated calculation on the wave called a Fourier Transform.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our aural machinery came up with a fascinating solution to the problem of distinguishing frequencies. Rather than discovering the mathematical method for calculating a \"Fast Fourier Transform\", our inner ears contain thousands of stereocilia - little hairs of varying lengths which vibrate at different frequencies. Rather than trying to determine the periodicity of a wave by any sort of analysis, these hairs automatically vibrate when any frequency within the wave resonates precisely with their length. This allows us to hear the various frequencies within the sound wave that reaches our ear, so that we can take in the whole ensemble of our environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now here's the catch. A hair that vibrates at exactly 440Hz, <em>also vibrates pretty well at 220Hz<\/em>. In a sense, this actually represents a weakness in our hearing strategy. Even though the one frequency is twice as fast as the other, they actually sound a lot alike to us. It <em>is harder<\/em> for us to distinguish middle C (C4) from the C an octave above (C5) than it is for us to distinguish middle C from the D-flat right above it. We can still recognize the difference, but when we do, part of what we recognize is their likeness. Other intervals share the same characteristic in different ways. For example, double a frequency is one octave higher, but three times that same frequency is a fifth above that.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, from an evolutionary perspective, this is a coincidence of the handy solution found to distinguish tones. However, the joy we find in music is so serendipitous as to beg for a more divine explanation, which you will find echoed throughout our history and surely our future, and within any moment in which you find yourself appreciating the beauty of well-tempered harmony.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37497,"question_id":37491,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37491/what-makes-tones-sufficiently-useful-that-it-would-lead-to-the-evolution-of-tona","last_activity_date":1441321285,"creation_date":1441304124,"answer_count":2,"title":"What makes tones sufficiently useful that it would lead to the evolution of tonal processing?","body":"<p>I will define a \"tone\" as  a steady periodic sound. As an example, I consider a sinusoidal wave to be a tone. By \"tonal processing\", I mean ratio relationships between the notes. For instance, if I play 220Hz sine wave then a 440Hz wave will be perceived as an octave higher. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don't understand why humans have the ability to perceive frequency relationships between tones. I have read several evolutionary anthropology books like <em>The Singing Neanderthal<\/em> and <em>Finding Our Tongues<\/em> and, between these two books, they suggest that the obvious evolutionary purpose of music is for communication. Each author takes a slightly different approach but the basic underlying point remains that tonal processing exists because it gives us advantageous communication abilities. But even accepting this hypothesis, it doesn't explain why humans have a tonal processing mechanism that is specific enough to perceive ratio differences between notes. The tonotopic organization of both the basilar membrane and the precortical auditory pathways might partially account for the machinery used for tonal processing and why the advanced forms in music could have developed. But this still leaves us with the question as to <em>why would such information be useful?<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>I remember reading somewhere one person hypothesized that the purpose of perceiving these differences was to identify \"relative pitch\", i.e. the ability to identify or re-create a given musical note by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval between those two notes.

To start with an example, there was relatively recently (2012) an important article by <a href=\"http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/veg/RatcliffEtAl2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ratcliff et al.<\/a> that shows that yeast can quickly evolve multicellularity under selection on the speed they sink to lower water layers. This article is one among many others and is far from being able to explain everything we would like to understand about the evolution of multicellularity. Typically, I think that this yeast species had a multicellular ancestor and we might think that this species would already have fixed alleles (=variants of genes that is fixed meaning that the whole population is carrying this variant today) in the population predisposing this species to easily (re-)evolve multicellularity. Also they may have kept some standing additive genetic variance in their genome from their past and they would therefore very quickly respond to selection as they don't need de novo mutations. (Sorry if this last sentence was slightly technical).<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the first trait that we usually refer to when talking about the evolution of multicellularity is the presence of sticky proteins allowing individual cells to paste to each others.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Some insights about the evolution from simple multicellular to more complex multicellular<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Then, we could talk about more complex multicellular and argue how do these simple multicellular evolve into some more complex organisms. A common argument is that multicellular can have specialized cells are are very could at doing what their doing as they are specialized. Also, some level of complexity is thought to have raised due to the fact that multicellular organisms tend to have smaller population size than unicellular (see <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5649/1401.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lynch and Conery, 2003<\/a>). It is important not to confuse evolution of complexity with evolution of multicellularity although these two notions are somehow related.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you mean by multicellularity?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The evolution of multicellularity can be discussed in the context where sister cells form an organism together or when unrelated cells (among the same species or even cells from different species) come together to form an organism. Also, the multicellularity can be discussed at different level depending on how we want to define multicellularity. Is a stack of cells reproducing individually, working for their own benefit a multicellular? Do we need division of labor? Do we need division between germline (reproductive caste) and soma line (non-reproductive case)?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How many times did multicellularity evolve independently?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Some people consider that there are multicellular bacteria (biofilms) but we will avoid discussions that are based on limit-case definitions. Let's talk about eukaryotes. Most Eukaryotes are unicellular and multicellularity evolved many times independently in eukaryotes. To my knowledge, complex multicellularity however evolved only (only?) 6 times independently in eukaryotes.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Metazoa (animals)<\/li>\n<li>Ascomyceta (fungi)<\/li>\n<li>Basidiomyceta (fungi)<\/li>\n<li>Viridiplantae (green plants)<\/li>\n<li>Florideophyceae (red algae)<\/li>\n<li>Laminariales (brown algae)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Model organisms and interesting cases to study multicellularity<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a bunch of specific clades that are particularly interested in studying multicellularity because they present transition states.

The difference between being truly multicellular and just being a group of cells is that in multicellularity, the individual cells cannot survive in the absence of the other. Moreover, different cells in a multicellular organism perform different kinds of functions. However, it is certainly likely that grouping without a strong dependence would have constituted the early stages in the evolution of multicellularity. <\/p>\n\n<p>One of the complex kinds of microbial colonies is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm\" rel=\"nofollow\">biofilm<\/a>. In a biofilm different \"regions\" of the colony have different kinds of functional roles; the \"outer\" cells take up nutrients for the colony from the surroundings whereas the inner cells reproduce and keep the colony thriving. Bacteria have also evolved a way of signalling (or \"talking\") to other bacteria (of the same species) by a mechanism known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_sensing\" rel=\"nofollow\">quorum sensing<\/a>, which in a way changes the behaviour of the bacteria when then stay in a group.<\/p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelium_discoideum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dictyostelium<\/a><\/em> or slime mold (or affectionately called <em>dicty<\/em> :) ) is an example of early evolution of multicellularity in eukaryotes. When there is plenty of food, dicty stays as unicellular amoeba. However, when there is a shortage of food, the dicty amoebae start grouping up and give rise to a multicellular \"slug\". The dicty slug roams around and when it encounters right conditions (such as humidity), it differentiates to give rise to a \"fruiting body\", which more or less looks like a fungal spore. In a fruiting body some cells form the spores (which will produce new dicties) whereas some cells form the stalk (which supports the spores). Apparently, the choice of what part will a cell become, is random and at this stage the individual dicty amoebae are no more selfish. The aggregation of dicty amoebae is co-ordinated by a signalling molecule called cAMP and this works in a way similar to quorum sensing.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4xcM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4xcM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n  \n  <p><hr>\n  <sup> Taken from Wikipedia <\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvox\" rel=\"nofollow\">Volvox<\/a> is another example of an early stage of multicellular evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>To sum up, as you said single cells can very well survive on their own.

You MAY not hear that frequency again but that's unlikely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>Okay, so tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, can happen because of many reasons. There are three real kinds:\n1) Spontaneous tinnitus can happen because of slight shifts in the acoustic systems of the ears, some of the hairs in the cochlea may amplify wrong and create a tiny feedback loop and ring for no reason. <a href=\"http://zidbits.com/2013/02/what-causes-spontaneous-ringing-in-our-ears/\" rel=\"nofollow\">see this article about that kind of tinnitus here<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>However, that's not the kind of tinnitus you're referencing. That kind, post acoustic trauma, is more serious.  This kind (which can result in hearing loss) results from either 2) one really loud noise OR 3) prolonged repetitive exposure to certain frequencies (like how your mom told you to turn your headphones down or you'd go deaf. Lower frequencies move a lot of air and can indeed be dangerous to your hearing.) Just how serious the damage from a single acoustic trauma event like the explosion from Children of Man would be to you would depend on just how loud the noise was you were exposed to, the frequencies of it, and how close you were. <\/p>\n\n<p>So now that we've gone over the different kinds of ringing-in-the-ears (tinnitus), we can talk about how it works in this situation.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ohniww.org/acoustic-trauma-how-loud-noises-can-damage-hearing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This is a great article on acoustic trauma tinnitus.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So these characters didn't rupture their eardrums or they'd be in a lot of pain and unable to hear at all in one side. Instead what happened was the tiny hairs that send electrical signals to the brain were probably bent and crushed (see awesome images on the article above of before, at, and ten days after acoustic trauma.) Three possibilities from here: either the hairs recover, they partially recover, or they don't recover at all. The most likely situation is that they do recover in a matter of days, leaving the characters with undamaged hearing. Some of the hairs (usually lower frequencies) may be more damaged that others. Those may dim or cut out frequency ranges in hearing. Multiple hairs cover the same range, so some of them may be out of commission while others survive, leaving you with diminished hearing of that frequency.

I think it may be several reason that 4-level system is better.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Storage space.<\/strong> If DNA is stored using a 2-level system, what would happen? For example, let's use 00 for A, 01 for C, 10 for G, 11 for T, a three base pairs codon \"AGT\" would be \"001011\", that would be a six base pair codon ,  so it is longer. Even if you want to use a condon to directly represent one kind of amino acid, there would be 22 amino acids and one start codon and one stop codon, so that need at least 24 different kind of codons. So how many base pairs would be in one codon? 2^5=32, so that would be five base pairs in one codon. For example, \"00101\" would be directly represent glycine. That would occupy much more storage space than 4-level system, which means our chromosome would be 40% longer than a 4-level system. Do you think it is not a big deal? That means we would need much more energy to replicate DNA, metabolism, etc. Creatures evolved from a very strict environment, wasteful organisms may not survive.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Too much error.<\/strong> The goal of genetic code it to inherent their information efficiently and accurately. Longer DNA strand than 4-level make it costs much more time in replication, transcription and translation, and also make it is very fragile and easier to break down. DNA replication is not like a computer. In a computer, you can select \"01010000101\", ctrl+c, and click someone else, ctrl+v, that would be a exactly same codon \"01010000101\", but it does not happen in DNA replication. The mispair rate of Eukaryota DNA replication is 10^(-8), but in Prokaryota, it is 10^(-5). So for original creatures, the possibility of error in a three-basepair-codon would be 2.99997*10^(-5), and the possibility of error in a five-basepair-codon would be 4.99999*10^(-5). Its error rate is almost twice that three-basepair-codon! As I said before, the goal of genetic code is to inherent their information efficiently and accurately. Too many errors cannot survive either. Actually, some biologist proposed that maybe three-basepair-codon is evolved from much longer codon, and longer size codon die out because much more error.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Codon Size Reduction as the Origin of the Triplet Genetic Code<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":37397,"question_id":37376,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1441064274},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b4833d86d3cccc3ccfd6eeaf0b767e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14946,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14946/mdperry","reputation":2645,"display_name":"mdperry"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c66c4d97a7bc3859a85253f003e1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"moderator","user_id":6,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6/mad-scientist","reputation":6781,"display_name":"Mad Scientist","accept_rate":55},"score":2,"post_id":37452,"edited":false,"creation_date":1441200186,"comment_id":62923,"body":"You can represent 21 values with a binary system as well, I don&#39;t understand this answer."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b4833d86d3cccc3ccfd6eeaf0b767e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14946,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14946/mdperry","reputation":2645,"display_name":"mdperry"},"score":0,"post_id":37452,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c66c4d97a7bc3859a85253f003e1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"moderator","user_id":6,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6/mad-scientist","reputation":6781,"display_name":"Mad Scientist","accept_rate":55},"edited":false,"creation_date":1441201548,"comment_id":62924,"body":"I may be out of my depth, or just confused.

They are general very impressive, fancy, and beautiful. Roosters, by comparison, are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRX-O9RVUpo\" rel=\"nofollow\">quite lame<\/a>. The link is a pretty good example of the sort of best effort I've seen or read about from a rooster. A lot of them seem to do quite a bit less than that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some time ago, I remember hearing about the various distinct finch calls, and the fact that these songs seem to be largely a <a href=\"http://nelson.beckman.illinois.edu/courses/neuroethol/models/birdsong_learning/bird_song.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">learned behavior<\/a>. In a modern factory style farm, chicks are usually hatched in an incubator and raised by humans in a brood of similar aged chicks. Some chicks, on more traditional farms perhaps, are raised in more natural settings with a mother hen present, and perhaps a rooster too, but even when a rooster grows up observing his father's behavior frequently, I wonder how often such a parent child example extends beyond just a few generations. In other words, I doubt that any chicken benefits from a long lineage of fine courtiers like their wild finch cousins.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question then is primarily whether there is potentially a learned component of roosters' dancing, and secondarily whether a lack of sustained parental lineage stunts the development of proper dancing in a rooster. They certainly have some sort of instinct driving them, and they're beautiful birds, but their mojo falls flat compared with more wild relatives, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IrlBKv1sE0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this pheasant<\/a>. To avoid soliciting opinion-based answers, I want to focus this question on specific verifiable knowledge. For example:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are there any actual studies on this topic with roosters or close relatives? Or is there any husbandry knowledge on the subject? For example are specific steps recommended to preserve the beautiful mating behavior of pheasants or pea fowl in captivity?<\/li>\n<li>Is there any evidence of learned avian  mating behavior other than song?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any notable recorded differences between the mating dance of an orphan rooster compared with roosters that have grow up with fathers?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Don't feel like you need to address every point for a good answer.

It's know that they do so to mark their territory. So when they want to mark their territory, why do they cover up their poop?<\/p>\n\n<p>I found an <a href=\"http://hinessight.blogs.com/hinessight/2009/03/do-dogs-try-to-cover-or-spread-their-poop.html\">old web article<\/a> where someone asks the same question, without getting a credible answer. He quotes a Yahoo Answers <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080424192530AAfTEcK\">answer<\/a> making the following claim:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This behavior is natural in dogs. They cover up their \"waste\" so that\n  an enemy does not find them, from the scent of the poop or pee. It is\n  an instinct handed down from wolves, who hid their scent by covering\n  up their feces in leaves, sticks, soil, or other nearby natural\n  materials. They also rolled in animal carcasses to hide the scent of\n  them. Your dog is just using her natural instinct to protect herself\n  from predators.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Another things that dogs do, called marking, is when the dog pees in a\n  certain area. They do not cover it up, as it is marking a territory as\n  their own. Male dogs usually do this on trees, wooden posts,\n  furniture, and other things. Female dogs do this in heat. Dogs do not\n  poop to mark something, only pee. When you dog pees or poops and then\n  covers it up, this does not mean she is marking her territory. Just\n  wanted to add it so you don't get confused. :)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I find it hard to believe these to opposite claims. One time dogs want to mark their territory and the other time it's scared from predators. I know many dogs that do not cover their pee, but do cover their poop, sometimes even within the same walk (and so the same territory).<\/p>\n\n<p>If this is true, why do dogs do both in the same walk? <\/p>\n\n<p>On Wiki Answers I found <a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_do_dogs_cover_their_pee_and_poop\">this answer<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The animals are not actually covering up the pee or pooh but spreading\n  their scent. This often happens with animals that are dominant (for\n  instance show dogs).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It's so that dogs never actually cover their poop anymore, they only perform some random scratches, throwing a little sand on the turd, sometimes even nothing. That fact makes this answer quite more likely than the previous one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another take that's similar to the previous one is <a href=\"http://blogs.dogster.com/dog_tip_of_the_day/2008/10/21/dog-tip-why-do-dogs-scratch-the-ground-after-they-do-the-doo/\">this one<\/a> from Dogster:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, why do dogs scratch with their hind legs after defecating? You\n  might think the dog is trying to cover up his poop like a cat does,\n  but it\u2019s actually a way to mark territory, with the scratch marks in\n  the ground pointing to the scent the dog has left.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I also found <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/about_6620614_do-scratch-ground-after-defecating_.html#ixzz2Rm5BDGql\">an eHow article<\/a> on this subject. It seems to agree with the previous two explanations, but is more detailed.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is normal for dogs of both sexes to vigorously kick the ground with\n  their hind legs after defecating. This is called scraping or peeling\n  out. Some dogs will also do it after urinating. Dogs are descended\n  from wolves, which also perform this behavior. It is not a bad habit,\n  but a vital part of a dog leaving a visual message and scent message\n  to any other dogs that happen to pass by.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They also say that the specific reason why they spread scent with their paws is because paws just contain a lot of scent.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dog paws contain scent glands. There are also glands in between the\n  toes. The action of scraping the paws against the ground helps release\n  the scent inside of the glands. Dogs scrape the ground in order to\n  increase their scent on the area near the feces pile, according to\n  veterinarian Dr. Justine Lee. Before domestication, dogs wandered in\n  large territories. One vital way to communicate with other wandering\n  dogs is through scent marking. This instinct has not been bred out of\n  the domestic dog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, which theory is the most valid? I tent to go for the scent one.

Since they are a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">product of meiosis<\/a> sperm are the product of recombination of both the male chromosome sets. <\/p>\n\n<p>While I'm sure that if we look closely enough, the germline cells that produce the sperm are contributing some protein and structure to the sperm, the life cycle of the sperm is mostly the result of the genome that it contains within itself.  Sperm are prone to defects.  On the average in human beings about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis#Motility\" rel=\"nofollow\">half of sperm are non-motile<\/a>: simply unable to form the flagellum or power its motion adequately for motility. That's a pretty strong selective force in the life of our other, 'half genome' selves.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Sperm selection - the sorting of which sperm from a single male achieves fertilization is pretty rigorous.  It can take <a href=\"http://www.newhealthguide.org/How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Fertilize-An-Egg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">30 minutes to days<\/a>.  Once in contact with the ovum, the sperm executes a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_fertilization\" rel=\"nofollow\">critical set of transformations and biochemical activations<\/a> to get past the various layers of the cell.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Sperm are from the man, but they are each living creatures on their own which we hope will deliver themselves up to the ovum to create another human being.  They vary in their genetic quality and effectiveness and this is highly related to their genetic make up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because each sperm is the product of two stages of Meiosis, they can be full of genetic defects, most of which would be fatal in a diploid human being.  The functions of the sperm as it goes through its short but competitive life weed out genetic abberations and help assure that the next generation of diploid human beings is as healthy as they can.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So they are not DNA boxes that swim.  I'd be hard pressed to think of a passive role for a cell in biology - they are all working pretty hard... I'd be interested in a comment with suggestions of something that is not under selective pressure in biology.   <\/p>\n\n<p>It sort of reminds me of the old argument about passive mating in females. Behavioral biologists used to think that female animals had little or no active role in mating.   That <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3826201/\" rel=\"nofollow\">myth was retired about 30 years ago now<\/a>.  That link points to an introduction to an <a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1631.toc\" rel=\"nofollow\">entire volume reviewing that whole discussion of active female roles in reproduction<\/a> in case anyone reading is interested. <\/p>\n\n<p>BTW I'm not an expert on gametes, but I'd be surprised if the ova also didn't have a complimentary but quite different selective process they had to get through to become a fully presented candidate for fertilization.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just to add a note about how the functioning sperm genes affect the diploid organism: This is one of the most important things that sperm does.  The genes that function in the living spermatazoan are the <em>same genes<\/em> the diploid organism uses, or at least a substantial number of them.  Further, these genes are scattered across all the chromosomes and so major chromosomal defects and important genes are functional if fertilization is completed.  As an example here's a cool blog post about how <a href=\"http://nittygrittyscience.com/2014/04/14/mosquito-sperm-need-to-smell-to-swim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mosquito sperm have been shown to use odorant receptors to orient themselves in the fertilziation process<\/a>. Those same receptors and the signalling genes that link that signal to the sperm behavior are probably quite useful to the adult mosquito.  I'd be surprised if human sperm also did not use similar pathways to function. <\/p>\n\n<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but the recent nature has a report of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/sperm-rna-carries-marks-of-trauma-1.15049\" rel=\"nofollow\">small RNAs in mouse sperm as being an epigenetic carrier for stress<\/a>. <\/p>\n","answer_id":16558,"question_id":16554,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1397669935},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1HuAu.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6314,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6314/doctor-whom","reputation":876,"display_name":"Doctor Whom"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":16561,"edited":false,"creation_date":1397570772,"comment_id":22385,"body":"what does a sperm do besides reproduce?

When you sequence DNA, you do something during the preparation of your DNA library to turn it into small fragments if it isn't already, like shearing the DNA. This gives you very small pieces of DNA that should still be quite unique when matched to reference genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>But as previously answered, the determining factor for how DNA is then mapped is the reference genome you are using. So the answer is what you state in both 1 and 2. When trying to figure out what DNA you have, you start with a reference sequence which is all of the genomic DNA 'layed out' so that your fragments can then be compared against it and matched to a best fit region based on matching sequence. Anything that does not match the ref genome gets dumped into a 'junk' output file.<\/p>\n\n<p>So conceptually, many gene sequences are highly conserved between humans and chimpanzees. This would mean that you could successfully align your sequences fragments to either genome. Importantly, this is number of chromosomes agnostic. It is the genes that matter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine that if Ras, Myc, and Erk are all on human chr 12 in humans, but split up in chimps so that Ras is on chr 12, Myc on Chr 13, and Erk on Chr 24, this would make no difference when you map back to the genome assuming the genes are conserved between human and chimp. If you have a sequenced fragment from human Myc that is the same as Chimp Myc, it would align to a location on chr 12 if you use human DNA as ref, or it would align to a location on chr 13 if you use Chimp as ref.

I will first address the two answers given by other users, which are both incorrect but have been historically suggested by scientists. Then I will try to explain the current understanding (which is not simple or complete). My answer is derived directly from the literature, and in particular from Mable (2004), which in turn is part of the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bij.2004.82.issue-4/issuetoc\">2004 special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society<\/a> tackling the subject.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The 'sex' answer...<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In 1925 HJ Muller addressed this question in a famous paper, \"Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants\" (Muller, 1925). Muller briefly described the phenomenon that polyploidy was frequently observed in plants, but rarely in animals. The explanation, he said, was simple (and is approximate to that described in Matthew Piziak's answer):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>animals usually have two sexes which are differentiated by means of a process involving the diploid mechanism of segregation and combination whereas plants-at least the higher plants-are usually hermaphroditic.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Muller then elaborated with three explanations of the mechanism:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He assumed that triploidy was usually the intermediate step in chromosome duplication. This would cause problems, because if most animals' sex was determined by the ratios of chromosomes (as in Drosophila), triploidy would lead to sterility. <\/li>\n<li>In the rare cases when a tetraploid was accidentally created, it would have to breed with diploids, and this would result in a (presumably sterile) triploid.<\/li>\n<li>If, by chance, two tetraploids were to arise and mate, they would be at a disadvantage because, he said, they would be randomly allocated sex chromosomes and this would lead to a higher proportion of non-viable offspring, and thus the polyploid line would be outcompeted by the diploid.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, whilst the first two points are valid facts about polyploids, the third point is incorrect. A major flaw with Muller's explanation is that it only applies to animals with chromosomal ratio-based sex determination, which we have since discovered is actually relatively few animals. In 1925 there was comparatively little systematic study of life, so we really didn't know what proportion of plant or animal taxa showed polyploidy. Muller's answer doesn't explain why most animals, e.g. those with Y-dominant sex determination, exhibit relatively little polyploidy. Another line of evidence disproving Muller's answer is that, in fact, polyploidy is very common among dioecious plants (those with separate male and female plants; e.g. Westergaard, 1958), while Muller's theory predicts that prevalence in this group should be as low as in animals.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The 'complexity' answer...<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Another answer with some historical clout is the one given by Daniel Standage in his answer, and has been given by various scientists over the years (e.g. Stebbins, 1950). This answer states that animals are more complex than plants, so complex that their molecular machinery is much more finely balanced and is disturbed by having multiple genome copies.<\/p>\n\n<p>This answer has been soundly rejected (e.g. by Orr, 1990) on the basis of two key facts. Firstly, whilst polyploidy is unusual in animals, it does occur. Various animals with hermaphroditic or parthenogenetic modes of reproduction frequently show polyploidy. There are also examples of Mammalian polyploidy (e.g. Gallardo et al., 2004). In addition, polyploidy can be artificially induced in a wide range of animal species, with no deleterious effects (in fact it often causes something akin to hybrid vigour; Jackson, 1976).<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting here that since the 1960s Susumo Ohno (e.g. Ohno et al. 1968; Ohno 1970; Ohno 1999) has been proposing that vertebrate evolution involved multiple whole-genome duplication events (in addition to smaller duplications). There is now significant evidence to support this idea, reviewed in Furlong &amp; Holland (2004). If true, it further highlights that animals being more complex (itself a large, and in my view false, assumption) does not preclude polyploidy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The modern synthesis...<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>And so to the present day. As reviewed in Mable (2004), it is now thought that:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism which was and is probably responsible for a great deal of biological diversity.<\/li>\n<li>Polyploidy arises easily in both animals and plants, but reproductive strategies might prevent it from propagating in certain circumstances, rather than any reduction in fitness resulting from the genome duplication.<\/li>\n<li>Polyploidy may be more prevalent in animals than previously expected, and the imbalance in data arises from the fact that cytogenetics (i.e. chromosome counting) of large populations of wild specimens is a very common practise in botany, and very uncommon in zoology.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In addition, there are now several new suspected factors involved in ploidy which are currently being investigated:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Polyploidy is more common in species from high latitudes (temperate climates) and high altitudes (Soltis &amp; Soltis, 1999). Polyploidy frequently occurs by the production of unreduced gametes (through meiotic non-disjunction), and it has been shown that unreduced gametes are produced with higher frequency in response to environmental fluctuations. This predicts that polyploidy should be more likely to occur in the first place in fluctuating environments (which are more common at higher latitudes and altitudes).<\/li>\n<li>Triploid individuals, the most likely initial result of a genome duplication event, in animals and plants often die before reaching sexual maturity, or have low fertility. However, if triploid individuals do reproduce, there is a chance of even-ploid (fertile) individuals resulting. This probability is increased if the species produces large numbers of both male and female gametes, or has some mechanism of bypassing the triploid individual stage. This may largely explain why many species with 'alternative' sexual modes (apomictic, automictic, unisexual, or gynogenetic) show polyploidy, as they can keep replicating tetraploids, thus increasing the chance that eventually a sexual encounter with another tetraploid will create a new polyploid line. In this way, non-sexual species may be a crucial evolutionary intermediate in generating sexual polyploid species. Species with external fertilisation are more likely to establish polyploid lines - a greater proportion of gametes are involved in fertilisation events and therefore two tetraploid gametes are more likely to meet.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, polyploidy is more likely to occur in species with assortative mixing. That is, when a tetraploid gamete is formed, if the genome duplication somehow affects the individual so as to make it more likely that it will be fertilised by another tetraploid, then it is more likely that a polyploid line will be established. Thus it may be partly down to evolutionary chance as to how easily a species' reproductive traits are affected. For example in plants, tetraploids often have larger flowers or other organs, and thus are preferentially attractive to pollinators. In frogs, genome duplication leads to changes in the vocal apparatus which can lead to immediate reproductive isolation of polyploids.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Furlong, R.F. &amp; Holland, P.W.H.

Closely related diploid deciduous azaleas are more than happy to accept pollen and produce seedpods.

We have attempted such crosses nearly 100 times without success.<\/p>\n\n<p>However producing seedpods and producing viable seeds are of course different. Some crosses of diploid X tetraploid produce 1 or only a few viable seedlings (We have never gotten none to date.) while others produce viable seedlings measured in dozens while still others produce hundreds of viable seedlings. In some instances, the same diploid parent will produce many more viable seedlings from one tetraploid parent than from another.<\/p>\n\n<p>To date all seedlings of diploid X tetraploid have measured as triploid using flow cytometry. Most seedlings appear to be sterile but some are fertile and occasionally some are very fertile to the point of setting open pollinated seed.<\/p>\n\n<p>When these triploid seedling are successfully crossed with tetraploids, we get what appears based on flow cytometry to be triploids, aneuploids between triploid and tetraploid, tetraploids, and pentaploids.

For example microsatellites (repeated sequences) are highly mutable. Note also that the probability of a given nucleotide to mutate depends also on the exact nucleotides that are around it (Rob Ness; Personal communication). The mutation rate is also a plastic trait (and is therefore under selection) in some species (of plants typically). The environment affect the mutation rate and the environment can be chosen by some species (avoidance) or even constructed in some species (niche construction). In multicellular organisms, the age of the father correlates with the number of new transmitted mutations as well. However I have never heard of any studies showing such behaviours in order to affect the mutation rate. Epigenetic changes (does not concern all species) can also the mutation rate and even into what new nucleotide the old nucleotide will be mutated into (with a given probability). Mutations are more likely to be transitions than transversions. If a specific region is under environment-depend selection, then a mutation that would allow to drastically increase the mutation rate at this nucleotide whenever the organism has a low fitness (or even whenever the trait of the organism is unfit for the specific environment) could reach fixation. This process (and maybe others I am not aware of) are I think encapsulated within a hypothesis called (and it is a horrible name as it can yield to confusion) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mutation\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive mutation hypothesis<\/a>. But really don't start studying any field of science by jumping into an advanced subject (or even worst, a controversial subject). You should start with an introduction.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, <strong>the impact on fitness (and on phenotype) of a new mutation is essentially random<\/strong>. An organism has absolutely no way to know what protein will be caused by a given new mutation. Selection then select upon the variance created by the mutations, the variance decreases and adaptation occurs.

There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fact sheet on Antimicrobial Resistance<\/a> refers to parasites separately from Bacteria, Viruses, or Fungi:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Antimicrobial resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The American College of Physicians makes the same distinction on its page describing the specialty of <a href=\"https://www.acponline.org/patients_families/about_internal_medicine/subspecialties/infectious_disease/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infectious Diseases<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ID specialists have expertise in infections of the sinuses, heart, brain, lungs, urinary tract, bowel, bones and pelvic organs. Their extensive training focuses on all kinds of infections, including those caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Many ID physicians specialize in treating patients with infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the Wikipedia page on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parasitic Diseases<\/a> points out the distinction:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h1>Terminology<\/h1>\n  \n  <p>Although organisms such as bacteria function as parasites, the usage of the term \"parasitic disease\" is usually more restricted. The three main types of organisms causing these conditions are protozoa (causing protozoan infection), helminths (helminthiasis), and ectoparasites.(1) Protozoa and helminths are usually endoparasites (usually living inside the body of the host), while ectoparasites usually live on the surface of the host. Occasionally the definition of \"parasitic disease\" is restricted to diseases due to endoparasites.(2)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In my opinion this is an important distinction to make. The treatment protocol for prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms are different. Evolutionarily, eukaryotic organisms are far closer to us than prokaryotes, and so strategies such as disrupting the ability of a ribosome to translate proteins, a method that some classes of antibiotics employ, would not only affect the protist or worm, it would more than likely affect our own cells ability to produce proteins. In bacteria, the ribosomal subunit is different enough that it can be targeted by medicines, yet similar enough that we can use them in recombinant DNA technology to reproduce mammalian genes. The closer we get evolutionarily to the pathogen, the more alike their molecular machinery is to our own.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even our own immune system makes a distinction. Leukocytes such as eosinophils are usually only raised to combat parasitic infections. Organisms that are medically termed as parasites also pose a problem in that they are often larger, protists, or much larger, worms, and our phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are unable to phagocytose them as a way of clearing an infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>From your question, you ask<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If parasites are organisms that feed on other living organisms, then aren't all pathogens parasites?<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I've emphasised on 'feed' because I guess the pathogens just eat us (i.e. take nutrients to reproduce and sustain their lives), right?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a host of organisms that live in and on the human body, that feed and reproduce in us and on us that do not do us any harm, known as commensals, and might even be symbiotic, gut flora. However commensals and even symbionts can do harm if they gain access to areas of the body other than their niche locales.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, immunologists often view commensal organisms as part of the bodies innate immune defenses against pathogens. Because they take up space and use resources that would otherwise be used by pathogenic organisms, then serve to limit the ability of pathogens to reproduce and to gain access to tissue that would be vulnerable to the pathogen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Commensal organisms can become opportunistically pathogenic if they gain access to sterile environments within the body that have not evolved to live \"in harmony\" with these organisms. An example of this is peritonitis. We can live our lives perfectly fine when our intestinal bacteria remain within the intestines and the colon, however if those tissue are damaged and perforated, these organisms that posed no risk to our health, and actually probably provide a benefit can lead to serious infection and possible death.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also commensal Eukaryotes, such as mites and fungi that either do no harm or are kept in check by a properly functioning immune system.<\/p>\n\n<p>You also ask:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But then there's another question. \n  If, pathogens need us (a host) to survive, then why do they eventually kill us? I mean, why did they evolve to become an organism that exploits their food to the extent that even they, themselves die? Isn't it disadvantageous for pathogens to kill their hosts, because they will eventually die? \n  Or I'm totally wrong, do those pathogen sustain their lives even when host has died? \n  Or perhaps they don't care if they, as individual organisms die, because they can survive as an species by infecting other.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think where you might be going wrong here is that you are thinking in terms of sanitary and clean forms of death and burial that is a social construct of human primates. Through much of the evolutionary history of multicellular organisms, when organisms died, they died in place and decomposed. This decomposition allowed the pathogenic organisms a route to go on and spread to other organisms. Other living organism came in contact with the decomposition and the pathogen had a way of spreading. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also many bacteria and viruses can survive outside of their host for extended periods of time, so they in effect are dormant in the environment until they come in contact with a new host that they have the opportunity to infect. In this case, the most important thing for them is to escape the host until another suitable host comes along that can sustain an infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though there are pathogens that have evolved the ability to circumvent our social norms. The body of a victim of the Ebola virus is highly contagious and can infect those that ritualistically tend to the body for burial. The WHO has developed guidelines to try and respect the cultural customs of burial while also preventing the spread of the disease. You could also think of Cholera. Vibrio cholera reproduces extremely rapidly in the host, and the toxins that it produces cause the host to expel the pathogen at a rate that can kill. This serves cholera as it can then go on to infect a new host. <\/p>\n\n<p>You also have to remember that there are pathogens that are pathogenic in one organism but commensal in others. The parasite that causes malaria is commensal in mosquitos. The vector for Ebola is thought to be bats, but bats do not succumb to the disease. So for pathogens like this, the strategy would be to find a reservoir vector, then find a host where they can replicate, then escape that host either to reinfect another host or find another carrier where it can survive commensally.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37354,"question_id":37308,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37308/are-all-pathogens-parasites","last_activity_date":1440948430,"creation_date":1440826456,"answer_count":4,"title":"Are all pathogens parasites?","body":"<p>If parasites are organisms that <em>feed<\/em> on other living organisms, then aren't all pathogens parasites?<\/p>\n\n<p>I've emphasised on 'feed' because I guess the pathogens just <em>eat<\/em> us (i.e. take nutrients to reproduce and sustain their lives), right?<\/p>\n\n<p>But then there's another question. <br>\nIf, pathogens need us (a host) to survive, then why do they eventually kill us?

While ~10 observations isn't enough to test the distribution accurately (and those tests are pretty flawed anyway), as long as the values are approximately normally distributed, then you probably meet the assumptions of most general linear model-type statistical test (t-test, ANOVA, linear regression). These tests are fairly robust to deviations from normality, so in a sense, as long as the values are close enough to normal, the test is fine (which says nothing about the interpretation of the results).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is the pervasive use of p values warranted? Is there problem with small sample sizes?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Although certainly not the first to raise the alarm about p values, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ioannidis's (2005)<\/a> paper sounded most loudly. The central idea is that, in science, there is a strong tendency to only publish \"significant\" (but whatever definition of significance you use) results. Thus the literature is rife with false significant results. For example, if only 1 in 20 experiments yield significant results, the other 19 are not likely to be published. Yet those 5% might represent 95% of the literature, and thus we have a strong bias in the literature. All of those \"significant\" results can't possibly be correct.<\/p>\n\n<p>Statistical inference from small sample sizes are also quite problematic (e.g., in neuroscience; <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3475.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Button et al., 2013<\/a>).

Usually the experimenter has an idea of what kind of data they are measuring and what distribution is the data likely to follow.

You can have a look at it too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually in biological experiments we measure some property, lets say expression of some gene. When you do several replicates, and there is no specific underlying mechanism that would generate variation (i.e. the errors are purely random), then you would get normally distributed values. Note that this applies only for the sample means. In certain cases, we assume that the variation in the value of a variable is because of some random fluctuation and therefore consider these variables to be normally distributed (not their means but the values themselves); for e.g. the weights of mice which are fed and raised equally. This is just your assumption which constitutes the null hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another point to note is that the variable that is expected to follow <strong>normal distribution<\/strong> should essentially be <strong>continuous<\/strong> in nature. Some discrete variables can be approximated as continuous but one should have a good reasoning of doing so. For example population sizes, though discrete, can be assumed continuous if the sizes are large. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Poisson distribution is unique and is a discrete distribution. Certain kinds of phenomena result in Poisson distributed RVs. These phenomena should basically be Poisson processes. See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36497/why-does-the-number-of-mutations-per-individuals-follow-a-poisson-distribution\">this post<\/a> for details. Poisson distribution basically models the probability of <em>N<\/em> events in a given time interval for some given rate of events ($\\lambda$). This rate is also called the intensity of the distribution.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Binomial is another unique discrete distribution. Genotypes resulting because of Mendelian segregation of genes, for example, follow this distribution. It basically models the probability of <em>N<\/em> number of events in some <em>M<\/em> trials. In binomial distribution there are only two possible outcomes. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multinomial distribution<\/a> is a generalization of binomial distribution with multiple outcomes.<\/p>\n\n<hr> \n\n<p>Since both Poisson and Binomial are discrete distributions they should not be confused with normal distribution. However, under certain conditions especially when the number of trials in Binomial distribution is high and binomial probability = 0.5 then it can be approximated as a gaussian with same value of moments. Similarly, if the intensity (rate) of Poisson distribution is high or the time interval is large, the distribution of the Poisson RV can be approximated to Gaussian (with same value of moments). In these cases, the value of the mean goes up significantly, thereby allowing a continuous approximation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many datasets show power-law like/skewed normal distributions and people often make the mistake of assuming them to be normal. An example (from my experience) is the expression of all the genes in a cell. Very few genes have high expression and many genes have low expression. This also applies for degree distribution of nodes in some real networks such as gene regulatory network.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary you should assume Gaussian distribution when:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Variable is a <strong>measurement<\/strong> of a value which is repeated several times from <strong>identical samples<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Variability is expected to be random in the control case (in t-test, when you reject null hypothesis you are actually saying that a certain variable does not follow the normal distribution assumed under the null hypothesis)<\/li>\n<li>Variable is continuous, or discrete with large sample size<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":37199,"question_id":37167,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1440774986},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1440920983,"creation_date":1440920983,"body":"<p>You are right to be suspicious. I would contend that, in most situations, hypothesis tests based on the normal distribution are not appropriate. If hypothesis testing is needed, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Permutation_tests\" rel=\"nofollow\">permutation test<\/a> should almost always be used.<\/p>\n\n<p>As WYSIWYG points out, there is no reason to assume a measurement is normal distributed without strong <em>a priori<\/em> knowledge. The central limit theorem is the standard argument for assuming that the mean is <em>approximately<\/em> normal distributed, but I would say that it is not very helpful in practise, because the convergence can be very slow: if your data distribution is far from normal, you need a large number of samples for the mean to be approximately normal. How many? Impossible to tell, since we don't know the data distribution! So in practise, the approximation can be very bad, and then the test will be completely off. This applies not only for the t-test, but for many parametric tests that rely on the normal approximation, such as chi-square tests.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are better tools nowadays. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Permutation_tests\" rel=\"nofollow\">permutation test<\/a> does not require the normal distribution assumption; the results are always valid, regardless of the data distribution. It is easy to carry out with today's computers, and simple to understand. <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387202792\" rel=\"nofollow\">This is a good book<\/a> on permutation tests (and other resampling methods).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ronald Fischer<\/a> and his contemporaries that developed the normal theory in the early 1900's were perfectly aware that permutation test was a much better solution, but it requires extensive calculations, which was simply not possible back then. So the normal test was developed as a poor man's approximation to the exact permutation test. But today, we have no need for this approximation anymore, as our powerful computers can perform even large permutation tests in the blink of an eye.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then why do people stick to the approximate normal tests still? Sadly, I think they are routinely used only because most biologists know of no other tools, and simply follow tradition. A historical reason behind the normal assumption in biology is a classic argument by Fischer, concerning population genetics: if a phenotype is affected by a large number of genes, and their effects are additive, then the phenotype variable is a sum of many random variables, and by the central limit theorem it should be approximately normal. The classic example is height, which is indeed closely normal distributed in the population. But this reasoning applies to genetics of natural populations, not laboratory experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is the whole debate about whether hypothesis testing (and p-values in particular) should be used at all, regardless of which test you use.

It is also possible that the predators have higher cognitive abilities allowing them to gain insights concerning the toxicity of one species without having to taste it.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if predators can tell the difference between the two prey species?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Your point, if I understand it, is that if the predators manage to sense (or to evolve sensing) the two prey species differently (in consequence the non-toxic species does not mimic the other prey species anymore), then the toxic species will not suffer anymore from the mimicry. So in other words, mimicry is a parasitic interaction but predators might evolve ways to sense the two species differently in which case there would have no mimicry anymore. Note: the predator is more likely to evolve good sensing abilities if it forages on few species only.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think your issue is that you should not consider a species to be mimicry if the predator can tell the difference between the two prey species. It is not to the human eyes that the mimicry makes sense but only to those of the predators. So, batesian mimicry is a parasitic interaction and if the predators evolve so that they can sense the difference between the two species, then there is no more Batesian mimicry and there is no more parasitic interactions between the two prey species.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why do you say that  \"physical contact\" not necessary for two species to have a parasitic interaction?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The interactions between species are defined as follow:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bEY4Z.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The benefits and costs (harmed) are defined in terms of fitness. These definitions do not involve any physical interactions. And to the eyes of the evolutionist at least, that would not make much sense to add a notion of physical interaction into these definitions.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the case of Batesian mimicry the ± effect is not always certain (while it is certain in common parasitic interactions)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The point is interesting. I think it just mean that the non-toxic organism is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_parasite\" rel=\"nofollow\">facultative parasite<\/a> (a species that can live with or without the parasitic interaction). Statistically speaking, if you have enough preys of each species and especially enough predators, then the consequence is certain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the common Ivy. It is a parasite of other plants but can also live on human-made walls in which case the negative effect on other plants is not always certain either. The difference between the Ivy and the non-toxic prey is that the fitness of the non-toxic prey depends on whether it parasites the other species while the Ivy is doing just fine on human-made walls.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can think about the interactions between rabbits and wolves. They share a prey-predator interaction which is a special case of the parasitic interaction according to above diagram. In a particular environment the wolves might be absent and so predation does not occur, just like the non-toxic species might be absent species might be absent and so the parasitic interaction does not occur anymore.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15528,"question_id":15526,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1440916825}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15526/parasitism-and-mimicry","last_activity_date":1440916825,"creation_date":1394089246,"answer_count":1,"title":"Parasitism and mimicry","body":"<p>I was reading <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13112.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> which states this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Classical Batesian mimicry, in which an undefended mimic evolves to\n  look like a toxic model, is a parasitic relationship in which the\n  mimic gains an advantage at the expense of the model<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't understand why this mimicry is equivalent to parasitism.
