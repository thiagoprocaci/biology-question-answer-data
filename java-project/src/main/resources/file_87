If you want to do everything yourself, the simplest option in terms of equipment needed consists of evaluating fragment lengths observed during gel electrophoresis after amplifying specific DNA sequences using PCR.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are content with some outsourcing, you can also send DNA samples to a commercial company for sequence analysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>A compromise between these options in terms of information obtained, is to do study <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism<\/a> (RFLP) by amplifying DNA fragments and using restriction enzymes to cut the fragments, before analyzing the fragmentation pattern using gel electrophoresis. To perform RFLP analysis, you would need to obtain restriction enzymes in addition to the chemicals mentioned below, and they can be a bit pricey.<\/p>\n\n<p>The minimum equipment would consist of a PCR machine, one or more pipettes with matching pipette tips, a gel electrophoresis tray with power supply and a transilluminator (preferably blue-light/non-UV). A centrifuge is not strictly necessary, but can be useful for processing/filtering your DNA source. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some chemicals will also be needed: Polymerase and dNTPs for the PCR reaction (or a pre-made \"master mix\" containing both), electrophoresis-grade agarose and running buffer for the electrophoresis, along with a DNA dye specific to the type of transilluminator (Usually UV or blue light). For a blue-light transilluminator, GelGreen is a suitable DNA dye. You will also want to use a \"loading dye\" to mix in your DNA sample before applying it to the electrophoresis gel. This can either be purchased or prepared yourself by mixing sugar and food coloring in water.<\/p>\n\n<p>You need some form of heating to dissolve the agarose - a microwave oven is convenient for this, but take care to avoid over-heating, glass explosions or flash boiling. It is convenient but not strictly necessary to have some lab glassware. Preferably use a screw-top bottle to mix your agarose solution. Always leave the top off when heating bottles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photographic equipment can be also useful for documenting results of gel electrophoresis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, you will need single-stranded DNA oligomers (primers) specific to the DNA regions you want to amplify.

They're both really discussion questions in a sense, but they've also both been dealt with in the literature in thoughtful ways, so here's a stab at an \"answer\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue One:<\/strong> how does your <strong>species concept<\/strong> deal with polymorphism?<\/p>\n\n<p>This may depend on <em>which<\/em> species concept you're using. And, to some extent, the choice of which species concept you use depends on what kind of organism you're dealing with (for instance, organisms that reproduce asexually have a whole different set of issues and challenge several species concepts). <\/p>\n\n<p>Various papers by Kevin de Queiroz deal very well with species concepts. In '<a href=\"http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/4652/1/VZ_1998deQueirozEndlessForms.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The General Lineage Concept of Species<\/a>'  (which is also summarized <a href=\"http://evobiojournalclub.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/paper-summary-de-queiroz-1998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">on this page<\/a>), he argues that although there are many different species concepts that can be better applied to different situations, they all share the basic tenet of defining a \"segment of a population-level lineage\". In other words, each concept is attempting to put a continuum into slightly different categorical bins, but they all recognize the existence of the same continuum (the lineage). (Also see his <a href=\"http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/6/879.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Species Concepts and Species Delimitation'<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I think most species concepts have no trouble dealing with polymorphism because the different morphs are all part of the same <em>lineage<\/em>, that is, \"a series of entities forming a single line of direct ancestry and descent\" (de Queiroz 1999).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Issue Two:<\/strong> how does your <strong>concept of the individual organism<\/strong> deal with colonialism?<\/p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/grads/mherron/publications/BR_08.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Does Biology Need an Organism Concept?'<\/a>  Pepper and Herron make a similar point to that of de Queiroz. They argue that multiple definitions (concepts) exist, and that these concepts all attempt to categorically bin what is in fact a continuum.

I would be grateful for any help/advice or directions.<\/p>\n\n<p>I work very frequently with large number of proteins and assess their importance in a biological network. Traditionally there are two methods used to visualise proteins in a network and withdraw conclusions purely on network architecture bases, before one looks at the top hits in details using databases. One is degree and the other is clustering coefficience. <\/p>\n\n<p>Degree refers to a node being connected to edges. The higher the degree, the more nodes are connected to a given node. Traditionally people interpret nodes with high degree as being biologically important, so called hubs. Since hubs are so highly connected it means that a failure of a biological hub has catastrophic consequences since the functions of many proteins are related/dependent on hubs.<\/p>\n\n<p>However what confuses me is the biological meaning of clustering coefficient of a node in a given network. I\u2019m aware that clustering coefficience refers to the tendency of a nodes neighbours to connect to each other; however, I was unsure as to what it means biologically and whether that means a node with a high clustering coefficience is more \u201cimportant\u201d than a node with low clustering coefficience. This just seems unlikely to me because hub proteins, are considered important proteins; however, hubs usually have low clustering coefficience but that doesn\u2019t mean they are less important since they are highly connected (high degree). Therefore to put it in plain english, why do people use clustering coeffience in biological networks and what biological information is it providing them?<\/p>\n\n<p>So I would appreciate any explanation/advice and references you could provide that would help me understand the biological meaning/interpretation of clustering coefficience.<\/p>\n","question_id":16921,"tags":["molecular-biology","bioinformatics","network"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":17252,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":225,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d41c5fded4545603fdf7f18e0f3d6189?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4645,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4645/jesse","reputation":61,"display_name":"Jesse","accept_rate":20},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/847e495210f12f3b0a91d3911f0f740a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4551,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4551/dmm","reputation":339,"display_name":"dmm"},"score":1,"post_id":10808,"edited":false,"creation_date":1381383654,"comment_id":14374,"body":"Sure sounds correct to me.   p.s.

Reptiles are a mish-mash of different mechanisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>If TSD came first, then the real question is not why did it evolve, but why is it still around. And the answer is likely because it works well enough. I couldn't find a lot of evidence that females make varying choices for next temperature, so in \"real life\" it might mostly be that plenty of males and females are always born. There is also recent evidence that genes affect when the temperature has an effect, so again, temperature alone is unlikely to drive sex ratios.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as possible advantages of TSD there is no definitive explanation that has held up to testing. It is possible that ideal female development has slightly different requirements than male development, so nest location choice by the parent may act to produce more females if the current environment supports them more than males. For instance, it has been shown that having more female offspring when temperatures are higher results in larger females.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry to not have a simple answer for you. The whole idea is fascinating, along with other environmental triggers to development, like worker ant larvae becoming a winged queen if given the right nutrition, or butterflies that add \"eyespot\" pigmentation to their wings in wet years with increased predators.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17234,"question_id":17233,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17233/have-there-been-any-theories-put-forward-as-to-the-reasons-behind-temperature-de","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/pets/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"pet owners, caretakers, breeders, veterinarians, and trainers","favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/pets/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/pets/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"pets","open_beta_date":1382400000,"site_state":"open_beta","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.pets.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.pets","name":"Pets Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=pets.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1381190400,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://pets.stackexchange.com","name":"Pets","twitter_account":"StackPets"},"on_date":1399485169,"question_id":3123},"last_activity_date":1399507664,"creation_date":1399460265,"answer_count":1,"title":"Have there been any theories put forward as to the reasons behind Temperature-Dependant Sex Determination in reptiles?","body":"<p>This applies to most if not all reptiles, but I'll write about leopard geckos since that's what I know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Incubation temperature of the eggs makes a big difference in the development of the gecko.

Occupational workers were pooled into one group and the mean value of SCE for those workers (11.31) was compared to controls (6.37). The null hypothesis is that the means are not different. They reject the null hypothesis. It would be nice if they included the standard errors for the means, so that you would have a sense for the amount of variation within the groups.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The SCE in workers exposed to CTP and to COV was higher than that of control (10.27 and 12.58 vs 6.37) respectively.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is likely an ANOVA with three groups (CTP, COV, and control). This test is kind of redundant with the first test, since the appropriate post-hoc test will tell you that CTP and COV are both significantly higher than control. But since they report only one P-value, then this is probably the overall F-test for the ANOVA. So all they can say with this test is \"at least one group is different.\" You don't know if, for example, CTP and COV are different from one another. It's not clear from the text that they did a posthoc test (Tukey's HSD, for example), but I doubt it.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In workers exposed to CTP and COV, there were no differences of SCE for smokers and nonsmokers (P > 0.05).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering only the occupational groups, the sample is divided into smokers and non-smokers. There was no significant difference in mean SCE between the groups. This is a two-sample t-test like the first one. The null hypothesis is that the means are not different. They fail to reject the null hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also possible (but impossible to determine from the abstract alone) that they did a single, larger multiple regression. Properly coded, they would be able to, at once, test for occupational vs. control, CTP vs. COV vs. control, and smoker vs. non-smoker. It would be pretty dicey with such a small sample, so they probably didn't take that approach.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Why do we perform t-tests?<\/h3>\n\n<p>The null hypothesis of a two-sample t-test is that the means of two groups are not different from one another.<\/p>\n\n<h3>How do we know that our data follows a normal distribution?

There are a variety of mechanisms that allow endothermic animals to maintain thermal homeostasis in a cold environment. The main ones are:<\/p>\n\n<p>a). The shivering response: When the core body temperature of a endotherm drops below a critical value (36.8C in humans), it causes the posterior hypothalamus to stimulate certain skeletal muscle groups (especially around vital organs) to start to \"shiver\" rapidly, generating heat.<\/p>\n\n<p>b). Compared to ectotherms, endotherms have more mitochondria per cell, thus allowing them to have a higher metabolism. Since metabolism always generates heat, an [general] increase in cellular metabolism will cause an increase in body heat.<\/p>\n\n<p>c). Many endotherms have layers of insulating matter, such as fur, blubber, feathers\u2026etc, allowing them to preserve body heat. In addition, endotherms can also route blood away from  capillaries via vasoconstriction of arterioles, reducing the area in which heat can be lost.<\/p>\n\n<p>d). As mentioned by Memming, brown adipose tissue also plays a role in temperature regulation. Thermoregulation-based metabolism in brown fat causes the P+ in the electron transport chain to go through thermogenin instead of ATP synthase. This process generates heat, but no ATP.<\/p>\n\n<p>e). Some endotherms, such as penguins and arctic wolves have countercurrent exchange in their capillaries. This is when warm arterial blood \"passes\" some of its heat to cooler veinous blood. This feature allows some of the heat normally \"wasted\" into the air to be recycled back into the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: Though it is true that endotherms are able to keep their body temperature constant irrespective of their surroundings (ignoring extremes), they do this at a cost of requiring significant amounts sustenance. Most endotherms require much more sustenance than ectotherms.<\/p>\n\n<p>2). Your second sub-question is very interesting. Though it is true that generating heat will require substantial amounts of carbohydrates/fats/...etc, it does not necessarily mean that the net consumption of sustenance in cold environments is greater than that in normal environments. In most cases, endotherms in cold environments will have exhibit significantly less activity than when in an optimal environment. The decrease in activity when in a cold environment will likely balance out the increase in thermo-regulation based metabolism. This likely explains why people tend to drink equal or slightly less amounts of water when in cold environments. One more thing: some reactions heat-generating reactions (like the alternate ETC pathway) do not require water. Glycolysis and Krebs actually generates water (not to say that there is a net gain in the body :))<\/p>\n\n<p>3). In truth, nothing \"prevents\" ectotherms from generate heat. They simply do not have the cellular \"machinery\". Ectotherms metabolize in ways very similar to other organisms, using molecules like ATP, glucose, fat\u2026etc. Unlike endotherms however, they spend very little of their energy on temperature regulation. As a consequence, their overall metabolic rates are dependent on the external temperature. The point is this: A substantial portion of endotherm sustenance is used to generate heat. Only a small (if any) portion of ectotherm sustenance is used to regulate heat. As a result, endotherms require much more nourishment than ectotherms.<\/p>\n\n<p>4). I am not entirely certain what you mean by \"evolutionary path\", but I will just say this: In many ways, endotherms and ectotherms are organisms that have found different ways to the same problem; how to regulate body heat for maximal survival and reproduction. Basically, <\/p>\n\n<p>ectotherm- more dependent on environmental temperature, requires less sustenance<\/p>\n\n<p>endotherm- less dependent on environmental temperature, requires more sustenance<\/p>\n\n<p>5). You are quite correct. The cellular and genetic components are very similar.

Like I've said, when in PBS they start detaching, and I would assume the same in HBSS, which I don't really want to use anyway due to its low buffering capacity in CO<sub>2<\/sub> incubators. <\/p>\n\n<p>Might DMEM alone (without FBS) provide a little more impetus to stay attached during the assay? What would the effect be of increasing the amount of FBS to say 15 or 20% during culturing - would that promote stronger attachment? I'm a little hesitant to coat the wells with poly-<em>D<\/em>-lysine, as my readout is on a fluorescent imager, and I'm worried it would substantially increase background.

After 72h incubation I trypsinised the cells and used FACS to titre first, but 293T do not express the promoter under which GFP is located in some samples and hence these do not appear on FACS.

Since in a randomly breeding herd (of cattle) we expect 50 per cent heterozygous and 50 per cent homozygous, the minimum for $2h-1 $ is 0. If the cattle's genome is purely homozygous (aa, AA) we have $2h-1 = 1.$ (h is total homozygosity--see Wright's paper, linked below.)  <\/p>\n\n<p>As we can see from this <a href=\"http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/Toc115570135.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">site<\/a>, a basic calculation of relationship coefficient may not deal with f at all. For two descendants B, C, the quantities $f_B,f_C$ are an attempt to factor in existing relative homozygosity that the coefficient of relation (COR) would otherwise not capture. Likewise $f_A$ measures preexisting homozygosity in the common ancestor of B and C. If animal A is the product of siblings then the homozygosity could already be quite high and this would maybe have measurable effects on the vitality of a cross between B and C.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now $f_A$ and $f_B$ vary between 0 and 1 so $s = (\\frac{1+f_A}{1+f_B})^{1/2}$ varies between $(1/2)^{1/2}$ and $(2)^{1/2}.$ Note that the important thing here is <em>relative<\/em> homozygosity of an animal and its ancestor:<\/p>\n\n<p>a. If the ancestor A and descendent B have the same known preexisting burden of heterozygosity we can disregard s (and f) entirely. Their COR will depend only on path distance. <\/p>\n\n<p>b.

This transfer may not have followed a classical route of infection. For example the case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), the zoonosis occurs throuch the rodent (primary host) droppings. <\/p>\n\n<p>Other example is that of avian influenza- the zoonosis doesn't happen via the respiratory route but by contact with body fluids of infected birds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also dead end can be achieved in the case of vector borne diseases especially those of Arboviruses. There is no mechanism of spread other than through a vector. <\/p>\n\n<p>In other cases the virus may not be produced in high titres in the secondary host to cause infections, but enough to cause mild symptoms. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to know how the pathogen can propagate in <strong>B<\/strong> but cannot infect: I dont have a definitive answer for this. If a receptor/viral adsorption site is similar between the two hosts but interaction with virus is much stronger in <strong>A<\/strong>, then <strong>B<\/strong> cannot be infected unless there are loads of virions. However once adsorbed, they can propagate within the cell and go from cell to cell with a relative ease, may be by using a different mechanism.

Along these lines, I wanted to impart an important concept to understand as you read.  Most proteins become either enzymes or structural components in the body.  The key to conceptualizing the DNA--&gt;RNA--&gt;protein process is this: shape determines function.   A strand of DNA is a template for which the Amino Acid (AA) subunits will be strung together in a chain.  That chain will fold into a complex shape.  The shape is determined by the interactions between the different amino acids.  Each AA has unique effects, causing the chain to twist, bend, loop, link together, etc."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1HuAu.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6314,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6314/doctor-whom","reputation":876,"display_name":"Doctor Whom"},"score":0,"post_id":17010,"edited":false,"creation_date":1398843056,"comment_id":23018,"body":"Once the AA chain is done bending, it&#39;s a shape that is pretty much unique to that protein.

For structural components, shape is everything too.  Think of an engine - the shape of each component is critical to its ability to function.

Therefore, there are $4^4 = 64$  but these 64 codons codes for only 20 amino acids (in most species). By analogy you may consider a base pair as a letter, a codon as a word (all words are made of 3 letters) and genes are sentences. But many words are synonymous. The genetic code is said to be redundant.<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA is a double stranded molecule, which splits in two around a coding region so that a RNA molecule can be created by copying the DNA template. This process is called transcription. This RNA is called pre mRNA. It is then spliced to become a mRNA (messenger RNA). The mRNA exit the nucleus. Two rRNA (ribosomial) RNA (which forms the so called ribosome) attach to the mRNA and tRNA (transfer RNA) will recognize the RNA sequence and paste amino-acids the ones to the others according to RNA sequence. This process is called translation.

First, you start out with a large number of cells per sample (preferably on the order of 10<sup>7<\/sup> or more - the more sample, the more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation\" rel=\"nofollow\">immunoprecipitations<\/a> you can do to different targets) and do whatever it is that you're going to do to induce <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">transcription factor<\/a> binding - expose cells to drugs, treat with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine\" rel=\"nofollow\">cytokines<\/a>, grow in different conditions, or simply compare two types of cell populations - normal vs. cancer, etc. After a certain period of time, determined by your experimental setup, you cross-link the cells with 1% formaldehyde, which fixes everything in place, including transcription factors bound to DNA. The cells are then broken apart by incubation in a detergent-containing buffer, and nuclei are harvested. After washing, the nuclei are either incubated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to digest DNA into strands of 1-5 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">nucleosomes<\/a> in length (150-900 bp), or sheared by mechanical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonication\" rel=\"nofollow\">ultrasonication<\/a>, hopefully leaving strands of the same length.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have your DNA strands, you add <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody\" rel=\"nofollow\">antibodies<\/a> to specific targets - either certain forms/<a href=\"http://www.cellsignal.com/common/content/content.jsp?id=science-tables-histone\" rel=\"nofollow\">post-translational modifications of the histone proteins<\/a> that make up the nucleosome, or to specific transcription factors or TF families. The antibodies bind to their targets, and are enriched by incubating with (generally magnetic) beads that have the antibody-binding protein <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_G\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein G<\/a> covalently attached to their surfaces. The beads are washed with low-salt and high-salt washes, then the formaldehyde cross-links are reversed and the chromatin is eluted from the beads in an elution buffer at high temperature (65°C) with vortexing in a thermomixer. Any remaining protein is removed by digesting with Proteinase K, the DNA is purified using a spin column, and you now have your enriched, purified DNA sample ready for sequencing.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Wka6.gif\" alt=\"ChIP method overview from CST\">\n<sup><a href=\"http://www.cellsignal.com/common/content/content.jsp?id=chip-assay-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Antibody binding and enrichment of known sequences is often first analyzed by regular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCR\" rel=\"nofollow\">PCR<\/a>, just to ensure that everything worked.

We are now near Step 1 of your illustration above. The read lengths of some instruments may be shorter than the average length of the fragments you prepared during the ChIP step (150-900 bp), so during the library construction phase they are further broken down into shorter strands before having the common primer templates ligated to them (if that's the technology you're using). Even if the instrument allows you to use the full length of your DNA strands, you need to remember that the sample is the aggregate DNA from millions of cells, and they didn't all break after MNase digestion in exactly the same way. <\/p>\n\n<p>After amplification and reading, you are then left a large number of short sequences, which need to be compared to a reference genome and aligned: <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BrSFY.png\" alt=\"Mapping reads\">\n<sup><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aMapping_Reads.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Since we've already enriched for certain regions of DNA by using the antibodies which bind to DNA-bound or -associated proteins, there will be a larger number of similar overlapping reads in enriched areas, allowing us to tell where the histone, transcription factor, or other protein was bound when the sample was originally cross-linked.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this all makes sense to you.

They are taking many reads from different cells. Why are the reads so short? Many modern next-gen sequencing methods are limited to ~30 bp reads. Thus, the reads you see are not actually the entire protected sequence but rather just a shorter fragment from the 5' end (where sequencing starts from). The why behind this is explained by Jiang and Pugh, 2009 (Nucleosome positioning and gene regulation: advances through genomics):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Three DNA sequencing technologies have been used to map nucleosomes. Pyrosequencing using the Roche 454 GS20/FLX\n  sequences nucleosomel DNA end-to-end, allowing both nucleosome\n  borders to be linked in a single sequence. This method provides the\n  greatest mapping accuracy, particularly in genomic regions of low\n  complexity. By contrast, other platforms, such as those provided by\n  the Illumina-Solexa Genome Analyzer and Applied Biosystems SOLiD,\n  generate only 25-35 by sequence tags, requiring both nucleosome\n  borders to be inferred. Nonetheless, these short-read technologies\n  produce >100 times the number of sequence tags at a similar cost as\n  the long-read technologies, and so the short-read technology is\n  currently the only practical technology for mapping nucleosomes in\n  large genomes. The higher tag count of the short-read technology\n  enhances mapping accuracy and thus provides a practical way of\n  mapping nucleosomes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Why are the reads overlapped? I can think of a few explanation for that. For starters, Protein-DNA binding is variable in its specificity. In other words, a given protein might bind at the exact same site every time or it may bind 'around' a site or it may bind randomly. A protein that binds an exact sequence would be expected to produce reads that are more in phase that one that binds more variably. Next, the nuclease digestion process is random (or at least expected to be). Thus the DNA cleavage point relative to the protein is variable and your reads start from different points. Again, from Jiang and Pugh:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At any given genomic locus, the preferential positioning of nucleosomes--called phasing--can be described. At most loci, there is an approximately Gaussian (normal) distribution of nucleosome positions around particular genomic coordinates, ranging from ~30 by for highly phased nucleosomes to a random continuous distribution throughout an array. How much of this variation is due to genuine positional heterogeneity and how much is an artefact that is caused by overtrimming or undertrimming of the DNA at nucleosome borders by micrococcal nuclease during sample preparation remains to be determined. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Does that answer your question? Basically the reads are overlapped because there are many of them and they may differ either because of actual variance in the DNA binding site (which is biologically significant) or because of variance in the DNA digestion site (which is a methodological flaw). As with any biological experiment, you must perform many replicates to statistically determine the source of the variance and this is done by taking many reads. I recommend you read the article I quoted from, it is a good overview of histone mapping with ChIP and is likely also applicable to what you're studying.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, do you know why there are two sets of reads (red and blue)? I would venture a guess that they are taken from opposite strands. In other words, they are reads of the same DNA region taken from different directions. That might help clarify what's going on.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To conclude:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DNA is not extracted from a single cell. In usual procedures it is\nalways from a collection of cells or from tissues.<\/li>\n<li>The overlap in TF associated reads arises because of the TF bound\nsequence coming from different cells in this collection.<\/li>\n<li>Each DNA piece is amplified and clusters are formed in the NGS\nsequencers (for the ease of detection);<\/li>\n<li>In a homogeneous cell collection i.e. all cells are of same type, the\nvariability in the read position usually arises because of\nflexibility of binding sites (i.e TF wont <strong>exactly<\/strong> bind to at a\ncertain locus). Also, as previously mentioned the variability can\narise during the technical procedures.<\/li>\n<li>In case of heterogeneous tissues the variability arises because of\ndifferent biochemical status of different cells. Strictly speaking\nthere is always some heterogeneity even in an apparently homogeneous\ntissue but tissues such as brain are highly heterogeneous<\/li>\n<li>In the case of nucleosomes the positioning is not exact because the\nsequence contribution to the position is very minimal. Certain\nnucleosome positions are tightly maintained for e.g. around the TSS\n(transcription start sites) whereas in other regions the positioning\nis fuzzy because of the dynamic nature of the chromatin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":16706,"question_id":16701,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1398833751}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16701/introduction-to-chip-seq","last_activity_date":1398833751,"creation_date":1397959143,"answer_count":2,"title":"introduction to Chip Seq","body":"<p>I hope this question is suitable for this site.

When they start to infect another organism similar enough that they can reproduce, they may turn out to be more virulent or fatal than is optimal for the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>The classic example is the case of influenza outbreaks, the flu virus is causing mild infections in other animals such as birds or pigs and then a human being catches it and it may be serious or even fatal.  This is classically because the viruses lytic cycle (where it reproduces and then kills host cells) is not tuned to the equilibrium ideal for viruses in the new human environment, which is not fatal which gives the virus the best chance of reproduction and retransmission.   <\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of Ebola and Marburg viruses the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/vhf.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">vector is not known<\/a> but there is <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/filo/bats.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">speculation and research going on<\/a>. So in the extremely rare handful of events where these hemorrhagic fevers have been caught by people they fatal.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its the non-equilibrium case where the virus is not adjusted to human hosts and adjusted for its vector population where it is usually most dangerous. <\/p>\n\n<p>If these viruses were allowed to persist they would theoretically come to the point where it wasn't fatal.  The problem being that people would die and there is always the risk that the virus would burn through all possible human hosts before it adjusts... <\/p>\n\n<p>I want to say that this is all driven by evolutionary forces.  If the environment encourages pathogenic characteristics then human pathogens can persist forever.  Flesh eating bacteria and MRSA and other antibiotic resistant bacteria have found a competitive environment where causing disease and death are the only way to go - <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/080401_mrsa\" rel=\"nofollow\">hospitals with antibiotics<\/a>. In the case of Ebola/Marburg, there may be a disease reservoir of monkeys acting as a pool for the high fatality strain.  Anything can happen with the right geography and dynamics. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you've been thinking to yourself, 'what are the odds that a virus or bacterium would be extra virulent versus not infectious at all?', you are right. One should also note that fatal outbreaks are rare and exceptional.  There are clearly plenty of cases where viruses or pathogens from other organisms can't get any traction at all in humans.

It is important to keep in mind that different regions of topologically constrained DNA can have different supercoiling values. For example, the action of unwinding DNA for transcription or replication introduces positive supercoils ahead of the polymerase and negative supercoils behind it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, supercoiling is present in DNA normally. Supercoiling is the result of more or less twist in a DNA helix, which is most stable when it has ~10.5 bp/turn (for B-DNA). Supercoiling allows under- or overwound DNA to return to its most stable twist. Negative supercoiling is the result of underwound DNA. Underwound DNA is not thremodynamically favourable and will actually lower the melting point of DNA (the point where strand separation occurs). This can be compensated by introducing supercoils but it is also important for processes such transcription, which require ssDNA. Negative supercoils and ssDNA can be thought of as interchangeable. Negative supercoils are also used to package DNA around histones in eukaryotes and archaea. On the other hand, positive supercoiling is the result of overwound DNA (also not thermodynamically favourable) and will increase the melting point of DNA. Positive supercoiling is often found in thermophiles which live at higher temperatures and need to prevent their DNA from melting excessively. It has also been suggested that positive supercoiling can play a role in regulation of gene expression (by inhibiting promoter melting). Organisms like to keep an approximately constant amount of supercoiling in their DNA for the above reasons; this is called the superhelical density and is characteristic of different classes of organisms.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16994,"question_id":16992,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1398794666}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16992/topology-of-closed-circular-dna","last_activity_date":1398794666,"creation_date":1398780649,"answer_count":1,"title":"Topology of closed circular DNA","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Why are covalently closed circular plasmid DNAs naturally found in an underwound state ?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it because this makes it easier for the DNA replication machinery to access and unwind DNA ?

Sexual reproduction introduces potential benefits because it allows recombination meaning useful gene combinations are created more regularly and deleterious mutations are lost more efficiently (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muller's Ratchet<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>It is thought that sexual reproduction <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/037570261X\" rel=\"nofollow\">first occurred in single celled eukaryotes<\/a>. In bacteria it has been shown that stress can induce the process of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">transformation<\/a>. Transformation is a sex-like process in bacteria where one bacterial cell takes DNA from a donor bacterial cell and incorporates it in to it's own cell, it could help to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1203263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">repair DNA damage<\/a> caused by stress. Transformation could represent one early form of sex.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to put a timeline on it because it can only be seen from fossil data. But from early primitive haploid organisms we would need the evolution of diploidy, some sex-determining mechanisms, anisogamy, and reproductive physiology for basic recognisable sexes. From transformation you could get early eukaryotes that take up extra copies of genes from donors, leading to primitive diploidy.<\/p>\n\n<p>To put down some unsupported thoughts (because this question is very hard to answer - there is no really firm consensus)... Once diploidy (having more than one copy of a section of DNA) is established it may be possible to form some gamete type functions, and anisogamy, where donors can more actively package, send, and receive large sections of DNA. From there anisogamy could encourage the specialization of gamete cells more similar to what we are familiar with (eggs and sperm). One likely next step would be through hermaphroditism - the ability to be produce both gamete types simultaneously or sequentially. Then some individuals would specialize in being one or the other (sex-determination). Continued evolution would lead to more distinct male and female phenotypes.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16988,"question_id":16813,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16813/how-sex-evolved-and-when","last_activity_date":1398770389,"creation_date":1398283913,"answer_count":2,"title":"How Sex Evolved ? and when?","body":"<p>As I know evolution comes bit by bit mutation by mutation<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How sex evolved which requires a major change in at least two individuals one to become male and one to become female ?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>When that happened as we can see sex in all animals and most plants? <\/p>\n","question_id":16813,"tags":["evolution","bacteriology","sex"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":16878,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":299,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":16962,"edited":false,"creation_date":1398688357,"comment_id":22908,"body":"At least fish should be able to do this - most Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids used for food supplementation are extracted from fish, namely salmon or cod."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79614cc5fcd376b95171a5c8f6354e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5754,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5754/jarlemag","reputation":3075,"display_name":"jarlemag"},"score":0,"post_id":16962,"edited":false,"creation_date":1398688558,"comment_id":22909,"body":"Fish don&#39;t make it themselves either, they get it from algae through the food chain."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":16964,"edited":false,"creation_date":1398694000,"comment_id":22919,"body":"So can the plasma membrane unsaturated phospholipids be made from scratch ?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":0,"post_id":16964,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"edited":false,"creation_date":1398697276,"comment_id":22925,"body":"@biogirl Yes, the unsaturated fatty acids will be incorporated into new phospholipids at the endoplasmic reticulum then transported in vesicles to the plasma membrane."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1398692117,"creation_date":1398692117,"body":"<p>Yes, animals can make their own unsaturated fatty acids. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mammalian fatty acyl desaturases can introduce double bonds at the &Delta;5, &Delta;6 and &Delta;9 positions (i.e. numbering from the functional group).

How we define species is debated but the most generally accepted definition is the <strong>Biological Species Concept<\/strong> (BSC). Roughly the BSC defines a species as \"a group of individuals that do, or could, successfully breed.\" <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/VA2OtherSpeciesConcept.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Other species concepts<\/a> do exist, some have their merits, but the BSC is most widely accepted and normally taken with a pinch of salt - it's not always possible to perfectly define a species because evolution and speciation are ongoing processes. Therefore, according to the BSC, <strong>two groups can be called different species even if the individuals look identical<\/strong> as long as there is true reproductive isolation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reproductive isolation can occur because of physical barriers such as rivers, oceans, mountains, environmental change. This is the cause of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">allopatric speciation.<\/a> One species could become split when a subpopulation forms on an island (e.g. if humans take them to an island). If enough time passes without migration they will become reproductively incompatible. Another mechanism is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric_speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">sympatric speciation<\/a>, when two species form without geographic isolation. This could be by the evolution of new behavioural, morphological or physiological forms which create division within the initial meta-population in to distinct sub-populations which over time become more reproductively isolated. Traits related to reproduction are amongst the fastest evolving and can quickly reinforce speciation (e.g. sperm morphology is extremely varied between species, see <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003GGST30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sperm Biology: An evolutionary perspective<\/a>, chapter 3).<\/p>\n\n<p>The higher up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aBiological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">tree of biological classification<\/a> you go the easier it becomes to classify things in to distinct groups, e.g. An oak tree is clearly a plant, and a whale is clearly and animal; further towards species definitions a whale is a mammal and a sparrow is a bird and both are animals; and perhaps less clearly, carrion crows and hooded crows are two different bird species in the <em>Corvus<\/em> genus. (Formerly these two were considered the same species!)<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously problems begin to occur when we consider species that reproduce through means other than sexual reproduction - e.g. bacteria which clonally reproduce. Traditionally this has been done by phenotypic information. We are now in the genomics era which opens new possibilities. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/12/302\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> discusses modern techniques by which utilise genetic similarity &amp; difference between cells to define species and they suggest it to be a good method. However, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764935/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> seems to suggest that genomic methods need some refining first before we start classifying species with them.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Currently, it appears more pragmatic and efficient to preserve the current species definition than to replace it, because it is serviceable as a first level of screening and current phylogenetic knowledge is too limited for a universal and sound change in the definition.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As for whether two species have been reclassified in to one I know there are examples but Google is not throwing up anything and there's nothing I can remember off of the top of my head - if I remember correctly the male and female mallard were once considered separate species because they look so different but I can't find anything to back this up.

Infection and generation of a porous cytoplasm. Viruses and bacteria generally are used. Retroviruses tend to cause leukemia so they are avoided however they are the only way to get past the nucleus in vivo of multicellular life. Electroporation and needles generate a porous cytoplasm allowing genetic material to seap or be inserted into the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>Once the genetic material is in the cell it has to have contained site specific oligonucleotides to hybridize with the strand of interest. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mfMdL.png\" alt=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Procedure<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The procedure for making mixed-genotype blastocyst.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Breeding scheme for producing knockout mice. Blastocysts containing cells, that are both wildtype and knockout cells, are injected into the uterus of a foster mother. This produces offspring that are either wildtype and coloured the same colour as the blastocyst donor (grey) or chimera (mixed) and partially knocked out. The chimera mice are crossed with a normal wildtype mouse (grey). This produces offspring that are either white and heterozygous for the knocked out gene or grey and wildtype. White heterozygous mice can subsequently be crossed to produce mice that are homozygous for the knocked out gene.\n  There are several variations to the procedure of producing knockout mice; the following is a typical example.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The gene to be knocked out is isolated from a mouse gene library. Then a new DNA sequence is engineered which is very similar to the original gene and its immediate neighbour sequence, except that it is changed sufficiently to make the gene inoperable. Usually, the new sequence is also given a marker gene, a gene that normal mice don't have and that confers resistance to a certain toxic agent or that produces an observable change (e.g. colour or fluorescence).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Stem cells are isolated from a mouse blastocyst (a very young embryo) and grown in vitro. For this example, we will take stem cells from a white mouse.\n  The new sequence from step 1 is introduced into the stem cells from step 2 by electroporation. By the natural process of homologous recombination some of the electroporated stem cells will incorporate the new sequence with the knocked-out gene into their chromosomes in place of the original gene. The chances of a successful recombination event are relatively low, so the majority of altered cells will have the new sequence in only one of the two relevant chromosomes - they are said to be heterozygous.\n  The stem cells that incorporated the knocked-out gene are isolated from the unaltered cells using the marker gene from step 1. For example, the unaltered cells can be killed using a toxic agent to which the altered cells are resistant.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The knocked-out stem cells from step 4 are inserted into a mouse blastocyst. For this example, we use blastocysts from a grey mouse. The blastocysts now contain two types of stem cells: the original ones (from the grey mouse), and the knocked-out cells (from the white mouse). These blastocysts are then implanted into the uterus of female mice, where they develop. The newborn mice will therefore be chimeras: some parts of their bodies result from the original stem cells, other parts from the knocked-out stem cells. Their fur will show patches of white and grey, with white patches derived from the knocked-out stem cells and grey patches from the recipient blastocyst.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Some of the newborn chimera mice will have gonads derived from knocked-out stem cells, and will therefore produce eggs or sperm containing the knocked-out gene. When these chimera mice are crossbred with others of the wild type, some of their offspring will have one copy of the knocked-out gene in all their cells. These mice will be entirely white and are not chimeras, however they are still heterozygous.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>When these heterozygous offspring are interbred, some of their offspring will inherit the knocked-out gene from both parents; they carry no functional copy of the original unaltered gene (i.e. they are homozygous for that allele).\n  A detailed explanation of how knockout (KO) mice are created is located at the website of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2007.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":16913,"question_id":15605,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1398657167}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15605/how-is-a-stem-cell-induced-to-assimilate-a-knock-in-dna-construct","last_activity_date":1398657167,"creation_date":1394391024,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is a stem-cell induced to assimilate a knock-in DNA construct?","body":"<p>While looking at (daylight) color perception I came across a paper by Jeremy Nathans (et al., Proc.
