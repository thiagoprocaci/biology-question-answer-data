The problem has been effectively resolved since the rediscovery of Mendel's genetic work at the end of the 19th century.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Regression to the mean\" is inevitable <em>if<\/em> inheritance works through blending of features.  That was how everyone believed inheritance to work in the mid-1800s, and Darwin understood that it presented an insuperable obstacle to his theory.  That is, if blending inheritance was true, then natural selection could not be true.  Darwin puzzled over this quite a bit, and came up with some unsatisfying suggestions to overcome it, but at the end of the day, one of the predictions that his theory of evolution through natural selection made, was that blending inheritance could not be true.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, blending inheritance is not true.  Mendel showed that in fact inheritance is quantal, not blending.  We now know that many traits of interest look, superficially, as if they're blending (which leads to regression to the mean), but are actually the result of multiple traits interacting.  <\/p>\n\n<p>With blending inheritance, the variation that is required for natural selection to work is lost, generation after generation; regression to the mean in an inevitable consequence.

Essentially, every case of HIV is effectively controlled by the CD8 T cell response in the early stage of infection, but the virus then mutates and escapes control, then the CD8 response adapts and controls the virus once again, and the virus mutates and escapes ... This can and has been tracked in many patients, showing repeated rebounds of the virus in the blood correlated with CD8 changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Better CD8 control of HIV is linked to a broader CD8 response -- that is, attacking many viral proteins, so that viral escape requires multiple simultaneous mutations (exponentially more difficult for the virus).  (Alternatively, the CD8 response can attack a small number of proteins that are very constrained, so that the virus can't successfully mutate them.  However, for reasons related to MHC restriction, that seems to only work in a small minority of people.)<\/p>\n\n<p>An engineered CD8 T cell response will inevitably be to one or a small number of viral proteins.  That's conceptually similar to the natural situation following HIV infection, meaning that the outcome could be the same -- viral mutation and immune escape. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because engineering the TcR means you can pick your targets rationally, you might be able to do better than the natural situation, but it's not obvious.  Overall, the fact that groups have been working on this approach for decades, without a breakthrough cure yet, suggests that it might be useful but isn't going to be a slam-dunk.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41983,"question_id":41967,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41967/engineered-cd8-t-cell-therapy-for-hiv-infection","last_activity_date":1451836705,"creation_date":1451780074,"answer_count":1,"title":"Engineered CD8 T-cell therapy for HIV infection","body":"<p>CD8 T-cells are effective in controlling HIV during the early phase of the infection.

Nearly all varieties have an even number of kernel rows.  This is due to the early development of the ear.  Ears of corn are developed from pistillate flowers on the ear <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/5/909.full\">(Bortiri and Hake 2007)<\/a>. Pistillate flowers are the female flowers, so they will bear seeds. The seeds are the individual kernals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long before the ear of corn has the kernels, it has several rows of flowers. The flowers develop on the ear in long rows. Early in development of the ear, the individual rows of flowers double, forming rows of double flowers, as shown in the simple diagram from Bortiri and Hake (2007). Both male flowers (left) and female flowers (right) have this two-row structure.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ALe5s.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>You can see the doubled pattern forming in this scanning electron micrograph of the very early development of the ears, also from Bortiri and Hake (2007). Notice the tip of the ear still has the single rows but the rows begin to double a little farther away from the tip. You can usually see this even on mature ears of corn.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QdmFm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>You can see remnants of this arrangement if you look carefully at a cross section of an ear of corn. I've drawn arrows to show the connections where the flowers once connected together. If you look carefully at the ear of corn, you can identify the rows. The doubled rows have the kernels exactly opposite of each other. Each doubled row is staggered slightly from the neighboring rows. I've drawn lines to highlight each doubled row.  These two photos are from the <a href=\"http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2010/issue17/\">agriculture extension office<\/a> at Purdue University.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/t67UF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QMqre.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The development of corn flowers and all other flowers follows what is called the ABC model of floral development <a href=\"http://ww2.biol.sc.edu/~krizeklab/0905NRG.pdf\">(Krizek and Fletcher 2005)<\/a>. The model has been greatly expanded since molecular genetics has increased our understanding of flower development. Many genes are involved, and the genes are used in different ways by different species of plants. The pattern of gene usage is similar in most grasses, which explains the double-flower arrangement of corn. Most grasses have the double-flower arrangement, and corn is a type of grass.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some highly inbred variety of corn can produce odd numbers of kernel rows, as shown in figure below, taken from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23377180\">Bommert et al. (2013)<\/a>. KRN is kernel row number.  RIL is recombinant inbred lines, which means different varieties that have been inbred for particular traits. Thirteen is possible, as are other odd row numbers. An odd number of rows is unusual, however.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9g6aw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Bomblies, K. et al. 2003.

Trying to explain the phenomenon of <strong>gut fermentation syndrome<\/strong> in such a limited fashion (age, gender, ethnicity, quantity of one particular yeast, etc.) will not help us understand it.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Common yeasts (C. albicans, C. tropicalis and Torulopsis glabrata) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to ferment sugars through the homolactic, heterolactic or mixed acid fermentation pathways, with ethanol as the major end product. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Candida is a very common yeast found in the environment and in and on our bodies wherever it's warm and moist (therefore the GI tract.) Candida species are the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in humans (followed by Cryptococcus and Aspergillus) and can involve any organ. Yet it's omnipresence does not result in <em>clinically recognized cases<\/em> of ethanol intoxication in even a minute fraction of people who carry it in their gut. <\/p>\n\n<p>Case reports started appearing in the literature starting in 1972, yet it is still a rare event to see one. In 2001, the case of a 13 year old girl was published. She had short gut syndrome and became intoxicated after ingesting carbohydrates. She had been placed in a rehabilitation facility with no access to alcohol, but still had positive blood alcohols. Aspirates from her small intestines grew Candida glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Short-gut syndrome is complicated.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have no idea how common fermentation into alcohol is in the gut, or what the results are, but it is probably far more common than recognized, can probably result in effects other than intoxication (for example fatty liver disease in non-drinkers), and probably has a role in other illnesses.\nIt's complicated:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Carbohydrate metabolism by gut microorganisms is a central process allowing supply of nutrients and energy to the host. This fermentative process is complex and involves several functional groups of bacteria with complementary metabolic activities that interact to ensure the biotransformation of polymers (resistant starch, nonstarch polysaccharides, proteins, mucins\u2026) into end-products (mainly short chain fatty acids and gases). Hydrolytic communities transform complex substrates into smaller fragments that can also be used by other bacterial groups unable to hydrolyse polymers. Other microbial cross-feeding interactions are related to the utilisation of fermentative products such as succinate, lactate or hydrogen and involve specific groups of microorganisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All we know is that it happens in some people, and that it can respond to antifungal treatment and some probiotic supplementation. \"Why\" is still a mystery, and speculation only.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcem/article/view/97311\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gut fermentation syndrome<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S3.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invasive Fungal Pathogens: Current Epidemiological Trends<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>IwataK., \u201cA Review of the Literature on Drunken Syndromes Due to Yeasts in the Gastrointestinal Tract,\u201d University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, 1972, 260-268.

Then the answer to your question will probably be \"Yes\" as primates seem in average to be more intelligent than the average animal and mammals tend to be in average more intelligent than the average animal. I'd expect too that vertebrates are probably on average more intelligent than the average animal. Let's not forget that some animals have no brain (e.g. Sponge).<\/p>\n\n<p>But now if you want to fit a regression between intelligence and relatedness to human for all animals, you will probably have some trend (a regression with a significant slope (positive correlation)), but you will have many group of points that will not fit on your line. Many birds for example may be considered as much more intelligent than humans depending on your definition. Many invertebrates such as octopuses are very intelligent, too. If you allow for a broad definition of intelligence, then you may also consider the intelligence of social insects which may be surprising. Some aquatic mammals are very intelligent although other, more seemingly stupid mammals, are closer to humans than aquatic mammals.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, keep in mind that intelligence is not easy to define, and depending on the definition, the answer will be different. Typically, if you use a very human-like definition of intelligence, you will probably find that intelligent species are more closely related to human. There is a correlation between intelligence and phylogeny (=tree of life), therefore yes, closely related species to humans may have some tendency to be fairly intelligent, but there are many other clades (groups of species on a phylogeny) that show some impressive intelligence, especially in insects, in mollusca, in  birds, the carnivora and the cetacea.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19552,"question_id":19547,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1404920820}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19547/do-species-which-have-a-closer-common-ancestor-to-humans-tend-to-be-more-intelli","last_activity_date":1451659038,"creation_date":1404868203,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do species which have a closer common ancestor to humans tend to be more intelligent?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Q<\/em>: Do species which have a closer common ancestor to humans tend to be more intelligent?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Our closest living relative, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee\" rel=\"nofollow\">chimpanzee<\/a>, seems to be regarded as intelligent:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chimpanzees make tools and use them to acquire foods and for social displays; they have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring cooperation, influence and rank; they are status conscious, manipulative and capable of deception; they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax, concepts of number and numerical sequence; and they are capable of spontaneous planning for a future state or event.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this hold in general?

Interestingly, it appears that the reason for this tremendous enrichment in citrulline stems <em>from the environment in which wild watermelons naturally thrived hundreds of years ago prior to the development of agriculture.<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>According to botanists, drought is one of the most severe stresses to which a plant can be exposed. Drought generates a high level of free radicals and oxidative stress, in part because plants maintain their photosynthetic machinery even in the face of severe drought. A number of investigators have shown that different plants have unique molecular mechanisms/systems to allow them to tolerate such harsh conditions and oxidative stress. <\/p>\n\n<p>Wild watermelon plants inhabit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Desert\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalahari Desert<\/a> in Botswana, where the <strong>annual rainfall is less than 2 cm<\/strong>. Despite the minimal rainfall, the watermelon (a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerophyte\" rel=\"nofollow\">xerophyte<\/a>) can tolerate the extreme conditions well with an exceedingly high drought tolerance. Surprisingly, this tolerance to intense drought conditions by watermelon plants even persists despite a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12102508\" rel=\"nofollow\">sub-optimally developed root system<\/a>. In the case of the watermelon, citrulline is overproduced in the leaves (and apparently the rest of the plant) and <a href=\"http://www.febsletters.org/article/S0014-5793(01)03123-4/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">citrulline acts as the major hydroxy radical scavenger that allows wild watermelon to tolerate the drought-induced oxidative stress<\/a>. From this same source (Annals of Botany - link below), there are also other proteins that may also be involved in these mechanisms as well. Even though the citrulline content is predominately used in the leaves to buffer oxidative stress, it appears that it secondarily accumulates in the melon itself.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: The image below is from Annals of Botany paper in the links below - it is OPEN ACCESS, which is why I posted the picture and included the reference link.

This is my summary, plus a few extra details:<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary gene product of the <em>INS<\/em> gene is preproinsulin. As the N-terminal signal sequence (pre-) emerges from the ribosome during polypeptide elongation the signal sequence binds to a signal recognition particle which arrests elongation until the nascent chain has engaged with the translocation apparatus in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The preproinsulin polypeptide is translocated across the ER membrane in a cotranslational process, and the signal sequence is cleaved off by signal peptidase.<\/p>\n\n<p>The proinsulin molecule folds in the ER lumen, assisted by various chaperones and, in particular, by protein disulphide isomerase, which ensures that the correct disulphide bonds form. The correctly-folded proinsulin polypeptide is exported from the ER in COPII-coated vesicles which deliver it to the Golgi. At this stage the proinsulin is cleaved by furin-type proteases (pro-hormone convertases; cleave at pairs of basic residues), removing the internal C-peptide (pro-) and after a little C-terminal trimming, leaving the insulin A and B peptides covalently attached via disulphides. This is mature insulin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mature insulin leaves the Golgi in secretory vesicles. Since insulin secretion is <em>regulated<\/em>, these vesicles do not fuse with the cell membrane constitutively, they are stimulated to fuse by a Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>-dependent signalling pathway. Vesicle-membrane fusion is mediated by SNARE proteins. At this stage the insulin has been released from the pancreatic &beta; cell. Notice, however, that the insulin has been extracytoplasmic since it was translocated into the ER: all other steps in the transport process are achieved by rounds of vesicle formation and fusion.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15997,"question_id":15982,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15982/how-is-insulin-transported-in-vivo-in-mammals","last_activity_date":1451589197,"creation_date":1395412641,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is insulin transported in vivo in mammals?","body":"<p>What is the mechanism for transport of insulin in mammalian cells?<\/p>\n","question_id":15982,"tags":["biochemistry","molecular-biology","molecular-genetics","endocrinology"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1451589197},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1393216327,"creation_date":1393216327,"body":"<p>The reason behind this lies in the properties of FAD+.

My question concerns the fate of fructose.<\/p>\n\n<p>To undergo glycolysis, the book states that fructose is converted into either fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) or fructose-1-phosphate (F1P).

Ammonia can be toxic in high concentrations, but the body can detoxify it through conversion to other nitrogen-containing substances (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea\" rel=\"nofollow\">urea<\/a>) or excrete the ammonia itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ammonia in the blood is freely filtered at the kidney glomerulus and can be \"trapped\" in the urine flow by accepting a proton to become ammonium (i.e. $H^+ + NH_3 = NH_4^+$) . Because of the positive charge the ammonium ion is unable to passively diffuse back across the tubules into the blood. This is one mechanism that ammonia is excreted. In the liver, the Urea Cycle (see any basic or clinical biochemistry text for more information) is a set of enzymes that converts most of the excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia to urea, which is a non-toxic, water soluble organic compound that can also be excreted in the urine. The body uses these processes to dispose of excess nitrogen from amino acids as well as ammonia that is produced as a by-product of bacterial metabolism in the GI tract.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some patients with significant liver disease (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">cirrhosis<\/a> from either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">NAFLD<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis\" rel=\"nofollow\">hepatitis<\/a> or any other liver-damaging disease) have lost the ability to convert all the excess ammonia to urea. In these patients, an easy way to prevent excessive nitrogen uptake in the gastrointestinal tract is by treating them with lactulose. Lactulose is a carbohydrate that that is not digestible or absorbable by the body, but is osmotically active (pulls water into the intestinal lumen) and acts to speed up intestinal transit. Since lactulose works by speeding up GI transit it makes you stool more frequently (which is why it is very useful for constipation). For liver disease patients, however, the lactulose acidifies (i.e. decreases pH) the lumen of the intestines and ammonia is protonated to form ammonium, which effectively traps it in the intestinal lumen. A lot of the excess ammonium can then pass into the feces and decrease the amount of ammonia that the liver needs to process. This is similar to the mechanism of ammonium in the urine as mentioned above. Additionally, lactulose also decreases the amount of GI bugs that produce ammonia containing compounds as well, which also lessens the amount of ammonia for detoxification by the liver. (Lactulose can also be used for a treatment for small intestinal overgrowth). These GI bacteria metabolize dietary amino acids and other compounds in the gut for energy metabolism, which liberates nitrogen-containing compounds that can be absorbed by the intestines.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35471,"question_id":8806,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1435098947}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8806/how-is-ammonia-removed-from-the-colon","last_activity_date":1451572966,"creation_date":1371321154,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is ammonia removed from the colon?","body":"<p>\u201c<em>Lactulose is also used to reduce the amount of ammonia in the blood of patients with liver disease.

So selection causes some individuals to perish \u2014 which genotypes are selected out depends on their relative contribution to the performance function. As you already mentioned in the question, selection would lead to reduction in variance; some of the diagonal terms would reduce.

This is captured in the breeders equation $\\Delta \\bar z = G \\beta$  where $\\Delta \\bar z$ is the response (in a multivariate space), $G$ is a matrix of the genetic variance within traits covariance between traits (different traits, the same traits in either sex, or the same traits in multiple environments) and $\\beta$ is the vector of selection gradients on all of those contexts.

In the absence of correlational selection (rω = 0) and mutational correlation (rμ = 0), the average G-ellipse is nearly circular, although the ellipse fluctuates wildly about this average (first row in Fig. 6). At the opposite extreme, when the leading eigenvectors of the AL and the M-matrix [mutation matrix] are both inclined at an angel of 45°, the leading eigenvector of G is pitched at the same angle (last row in Fig. 6). Between these two extremes, G tends to evolve to a shape and orientation that represents an intermediate compromise between the AL and M. In other words, the simulation results confirm our intuition and theoretical expectations (Lande 1980b) that G should evolve toward alignment with the AL and M.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Simulation studies of the G-matrix:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bürger R, Wagner GP, Stettinger J.

As posted before me it is true that only adults, but not juvenile individuals show this difference. Direct and indirect effects of sex hormones on bone marrow erythropoiesis and renal erythropoietin production has been proven, but it works in both sexes the same way. Females are capable to elevate their haemoglobin / red blood cell levels to external stimuli, yet at same conditions (same altitude etc) the difference remains. Also:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Men, premenopausal women and postmenopausal women have similar plasma erythropoietin levels<\/strong>, indicating that women do not attempt to compensate for their lower haemoglobin levels by increasing erythropoietic drive. These observations show that the prevailing lower haemoglobin level in females cannot be ascribed to a lack of bone marrow or renal erythropoietic capability: they indicate that <strong>adult females maintain their venous haemoglobin levels at a lower level than adult males as a physiological steady state<\/strong> \u2014 they do not try under physiological conditions to maintain the same levels as adult males. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be achieved by modulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus signal (JGA) of the kidney. The JGA has important role in the regulation of the haemoglobin level - it is the main input for erythropoietic red blood cell production by regulating renal filtration and thus regulating the amount of oxygen that gets to the EPO producing peritubular cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is noteworthy to say that similar difference exist in mammals and even there are examples among birds and reptiles.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is described in the linked paper that both men and women achieve the same or very similar microcirculatory haematocrit level inspite the different mean venous haemoglobin levels. <\/p>\n\n<p>This implies the very interesting theory / reasoning in the article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(...) that both sexes set their mean optimum level separately and to some degree independently.(...) the red cell mass is an enormous resource in animals \u2014 one third of the body's cells by number in adult humans, and demands enormous effort to establish and maintain.(...)This price must be paid for by increased fitness.(...)The excess red cells over the critical minimum that circulate in the large vessels (and slowly through in the spleen in some species) and that constitute half or more of the venous haemoglobin level probably provide a storage function for the reserve red cell mass for use when the need arises for increased work \u2014 fight, flight, food and reproduction. They may also act as reserves for heat exchange and iron storage. It is likely that the return in fitness from this reserve differs between the sexes, and therefore that the optimal size for maximal cost benefit also differs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":31329,"question_id":27536,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1429113266},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c328eca0fa69c04d16d428aba6c366c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":20887,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/20887/waktole-yadeta","reputation":1,"display_name":"waktole yadeta"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":1,"post_id":41907,"edited":false,"creation_date":1451550851,"comment_id":71341,"body":"Please could you add some references to your answer"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1451540110,"creation_date":1451540110,"body":"<p>males have testosterone that increase thyroxin secretion.thyroxin is importnat for ATP production,then if there is more energy production more oxygen is needed that directly increase more epo production.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41907,"question_id":27536,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27536/why-do-men-have-a-higher-hematocrit-red-blood-cell-count-than-women","last_activity_date":1451540110,"creation_date":1420895962,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why do men have a higher hematocrit (red blood cell count) than women?","body":"<p>The hematocrit, also known as packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF), is the volume percentage (%) of red blood cells in blood.

It will be found in any product that contained sugar or high fructose corn syrup that has been heated, such as baked goods. The reason you are likely to encounter it in honey is foremost that honey is 70-80% reducing sugars (<a href=\"http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2001/loveridge/index-page3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a>) and also that bee keepers often supplement HFCS for actual flower nectar when there is not enough flower nectar available for the bees to use to produce honey.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Toxic Honey<\/h2>\n\n<p>One thing to note is that there are toxic forms of honey, just as there are poisonous mushrooms and edible mushrooms. Honey derived from rhododendrons can contain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayanotoxin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grayanotoxin<\/a>, however it is rarely fatal in humans. If you are buying your honey from a supermarket or a reputable keeper, then there is almost no chance that your honey will contain grayanotoxin.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why is Honey Harmful to Infants?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The issue with honey is that it can contain <em>Clostridium botulinum<\/em> spores. If the spores germinate, the resulting bacteria release botulinum toxin. <\/p>\n\n<p>Botulinum toxin, which is the cause of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs270/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">botulism<\/a>, is a neurotoxin that causes dystonia, and can be lethal in minute doses (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin\" rel=\"nofollow\">ng/kg doses<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>For most adults, the risk of botulism from the spores found in honey is minute. The gut microbiome and immune system proteins such as defensins will prevent <em>C. botulinum<\/em> colonization, so even if the spores germinate, they will not grow to a critical mass to produce enough toxin to do harm and will be excreted.<\/p>\n\n<p>This however is not the case for infants less than six months of age. Their microbiome is still developing and their immune system is not fully formed. Also, as they have less mass, it takes a lesser absolute amount of the toxin to cause illness and death.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>C. botulinum<\/em> spores are heat resistant, though they can be killed by boiling (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs270/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">7<\/a>), which means that the internal temperature of the spore needs to reach >85°C for over 5 minutes. Pasteurized honey should already have had this treatment, however you will still see the warnings to not feed to infants less than six months to one year of age, as commercial heat pasteurization may not kill all of the spores (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs270/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">7<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So unless you are immunocompromised, have no gut microbiome, are an infant less than six months of age, or your boiled water does not stay at a temperature greater than >85°C for longer than 5 minutes, and are using raw honey, then you shouldn't be at too much risk.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Edit<\/h3>\n\n<p>Information has been reorganized to better reflect edit to question.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41841,"question_id":41836,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1451527256}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41836/is-honey-in-hot-green-tea-unsafe","last_activity_date":1451527256,"creation_date":1451322951,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is honey in hot green tea unsafe?","body":"<p>I used Google to try to figure out what kind of mixture honey has with hot water, and I found several Ayurvedic sources claiming that honey in hot water is toxic.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wisdomsofhealth.com/honey_never_in_hot_water\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honey \u2013 NEVER Put It in Hot Water/Teas<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mockingbirdmeadows.com/2013/11/19/reasons-you-should-never-cook-with-honey/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5 Reasons You Should NEVER Cook With Honey<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://truththeory.com/2012/07/29/honey-a-must-read-for-those-who-eat-it-regularly/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honey: A Must Read For Those Who Eat It Regularly<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is how does heating honey make it toxic? <\/p>\n\n<p>Is there something that happens at the molecular level that changes the chemical properties of honey when it is heated?

The big thing that racial typing is based on is skin colour, but skin colour is controlled by only a small number of alleles. On the basis of skin colour you'd think the big division in human diversity is (and I simplify) between white Europeans and black Africans. However, there is <em>vastly<\/em> more genetic diversity within Africa than there is anywhere else.

In it's essence, we're trying to get someone to develop immunologic tolerance to a given allergen such as pollen, okay! So how does it happen at the cellular level? (Assuming the treatment protocol is known)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://med.uth.edu/orl/newsletter/understanding-mechanism-allergen-immunotherapy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding The Mechanism Of Allergen Immunotherapy<\/a>, as an article is kind of a broad overview. Thus there are phases to AIT that include early, intermediate and late phases. The process begins with a downregulation of mast cell and basophil activity, followed by induction of allergen specific Treg cells, a decrease in Th2 cells, and then a decrease in IgE production with an increase in IgG4/IgA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mechanistically, it doesn't look like it's well known how basophils and mast cells get regulated by AIT, but the theory is that the mechanism may resemble H2R (a histamine receptor) receptor activity during venom immunotherapy: H2R becomes highly upregulated after therapy start, and inhibits Fcε-R1 activation of mast cells and basophils, even in the presence of IgE (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581429\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>, paywall on this one).<\/p>\n\n<p>They provide an impressive table in Akdis &amp; Akdis 2014 as to the role of immune cells in AIT:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hl41u.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hl41u.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So in the process of encountering the allergen, the immune system produces Treg cells as a result of dendritic cell antigen presentation. An inducible type of Treg called Tr1 is capable of abrogating the response of Th2 and Th1 cells through the secretion of TGF-ß and IL-10. They have a good table for this, too:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dj4vJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dj4vJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>There's an effect in there due to TGF-ß exerting its effect on B cells that ends up inhibiting class switching to most other immunoglobulins except mucosal IgA. In conjunction with IL-4, IL-10 is capable of promoting the class switch of preceding B cells to IgG4. So the classes of Ig will largely become IgG4 and IgA in response to the allergen of interest. The B cells will also begin to produce their own IL-10, and in a way become a regulatory type of B cell, or Breg, that propagates the tolerogenic response.<\/p>\n\n<p>And so the big conclusion: (1) the mast cells/basophils aren't as prone to causing anaphylaxis, (2) the effector cells specific for the allergen have actually shifted to populations of tolerogenic DCs, Tregs and Bregs, and (3) antibody production has shifted to IgG4/IgA from IgE. The net result is due to the repeated exposure to the allergen at some optimal concentration, but the key is they performed the treatment slow enough that the immune system had time to build up tolerance without going crazy. It's also likely that we don't know how long the system stays tolerant for after successful treatment.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's much more complicated and if you can get past the paywall on source 2 there's really good, detailed info.

While there are many other hindgut fermenters, these species are good illustrations of  different ways hindgut fermenters can digest and absorb nutrients from their food.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Horse<\/h2>\n\n<p>As you know, absorption of \"nutrients\" occurs along the intestines, but at varying degrees at different sites. Most compounds are primary absorbed in the small intestine of the horse. This includes protein, glucose (soluble carbohydrates), fats, calcium, and magnesium.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any carbohydrates that are not absorbed in the small intestine reach the hind gut. Here they are fermented by bacteria to short-chain volatile fatty acids  (VFAs) and lactic acid. Horses can use the VFAs (propionate, butyrate, and acetate) as an energy source, but a diet too high in grain can also lead to excessive lactic acid production in the hindgut, and as a result the horse may experience colic.  As your question pertains to the hind gut, a nutrient of main concern is therefore volatile fatty acids.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hindgut of the horse is very long and developed. To review with the anatomy of the horse hindgut, it consists of the caecum, ventral colon, dorsal colon, transverse colon, descending colon (or small colon), and rectum.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yqhj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yqhj.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In a study in 1974, <a href=\"http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/226/5/1043\" rel=\"nofollow\">RA Argenzio et al.<\/a> determined that among the parts of the horse hindgut, most VFAs were produced and absorbed in the ventral colon, 8-12 hours after feeding. This is depicted by the graph below, which shows a large negative net production of VFAs after 8-12 hours (i.e. more VFAs absorbed than produced). Note that the caecum and dorsal colon are also important sites of VFA production and absorption.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JjBbg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JjBbg.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The hindgut is also an important site for phosphorus absorption in the horse, unlike many other species that primarily absorb phosphorus in the small intestine. This is thought to be because most of the dietary phosphorus in the horse in phytin phosphate, which must be exposed to the enzyme phytase produced by the microbial flora in order to be absorbed. Studies such as <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/102/1/143.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schryver et al.<\/a> (1972) and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-3306.1999.tb05274.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">T. Matsui et al.<\/a> (1999) have shown that most phosphorus is excreted by the small intestine and caecum, and most is absorbed in the dorsal colon and small colon. The figure below from Schryver shows the net absorption of phosphorus on the various experimental diets. Note that this is oriented opposite to the VFA figure above; absorption is positive rather than negative on this graph.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpMnT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpMnT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Rabbit<\/h2>\n\n<p>To begin with the rabbit anatomy, you will note that the colon of the rabbit is much less developed than that of the horse. However, both are hindgut fermenters, and what they do have in common is a very large caecum.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U8Lld.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U8Lld.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As in the horse, much of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. This includes protein, fats, and simple carbohydrates (glucose), as well as some vitamins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also like the horse, the digestable material not absorbed by the small intestine passes to the caecum, where it undergoes fermentation by the microbial flora. The large fibrous material passes directly to the colon, where water is absorbed and forms hard faecal pellets, while the small digestible material passes through reverse peristalsis into the caecum. What is different in a rabbit to a horse, however, is that the about 8 hours after feeding, the caecal material is packaged into a small pellet called a caecotrophe. As or shortly after the caecotrophe is excreted, the rabbit re-ingests the caecotrophe. As this food has been digested once already, the small intestine is better able to absorb nutrients from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an example, important nutrients that are able to be absorbed due to caecotrophy in the rabbit are the B vitamins such as niacin, riboflavin, folate, and cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12<\/sub>). One of the early studies on this topic is <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/49/4/639.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kulwich et al.<\/a> (1953).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n\n<p>The reason for the difference between the horse and rabbit is fundamentally an anatomical difference. Both species have a large caecum which enables fermentation of plant matter. However, the horse has a long, voluminous colon in which it can absorb many nutrients, but they will lose protein and other nutrients in this process because the colon is less adapted to absorb them.

Musical instruments have been found dating back tens of thousands of years. Yet no one knows why we love music, or what function, if any, it serves.\nResearchers have yet to find a \"music center\" in the brain. Like many higher-order processes, the tasks involved in processing and enjoying music are distributed across several brain areas.\nOne study found that when focusing on harmony in a piece, a subject experiences increased activity in the right temporal lobe's auditory areas. Several studies have shown the temporal lobe to be one key region for understanding certain musical features. But it works closely with areas in the frontal lobe responsible for forming meaningful musical syntax (or structure).\nOther studies have focused on our emotional responses to music.\nA 2001 experiment at McGill College used brain scans to study the neural mechanics of the goosebumps that great music can sometimes induce. They found that the brain structures activated are the same regions linked to other euphoric stimuli, such as food, sex and drugs.\nBlood flow in the brain rises and falls to swells of music in areas associated with reward, emotion and arousal.\nAs stimulation for food and sex are important for a organism's survival, the fact that similar neural activity is observed in responses to features in music suggests that there could be some evolutionary advantage to the ability to hear \u2014 or hum \u2014 a good tune.\nMany pet owners leave their home radios playing all day for the listening pleasure of their dogs and cats. Station choices vary. \"We have a very human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we like,\" said Charles Snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of animals. \"People assume that if they like Mozart, their dog will like Mozart. If they like rock music, they say their dog prefers rock.\"\nAgainst the conventional wisdom that music is a uniquely human phenomenon, recent and ongoing research shows that animals actually do share our capacity for it. But rather than liking classical or rock, Snowdon, an animal psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has discovered that animals march to the beat of a different drum altogether. They enjoy what he calls \"species-specific music\": tunes specially designed using the pitches, tones and tempos that are familiar to their particular species.\nWith no pun intended, music is all about scale: Humans like music that falls within our acoustic and vocal range, uses tones we understand, and progresses at a tempo similar to that of our heartbeats. A tune pitched too high or low sounds grating or ungraspable, and music too fast or slow is unrecognizable as such.\nTo most animals, human music falls into that ungraspable, unrecognizable category. With vocal ranges and heart rates very different from ours, they simply aren't wired to appreciate songs tailored for our ears. Most studies find that, try as we might to get their legs thumping, animals generally respond to human music with a total lack of interest. That's why Snowdon has worked with cellist and composer David Teie to compose music that is tailored to suit them.\nBack in 2009, the researchers composed two songs for tamarins \u2014 monkeys with vocalizations three octaves higher than our own and heart rates twice as fast. The songs sound shrill and unpleasant to us, but they seem to be music to the monkeys' ears. The song modeled on excited monkey tones and set to a fast tempo made the tamarins visibly agitated and active. By contrast, they calmed down and became unusually social in response to a \"tamarin ballad,\" which incorporated happy monkey tones and a slower tempo.\nSnowdon and Teie have moved on to composing music for cats, and studying how they respond to it.\n\"We have some work-in-progress where we've transposed music and put it in the frequency range for cat vocalizations, and have used their resting heart rate, which is faster than ours,\" he told Life's Little Mysteries. \"We find that cats prefer to listen to the music composed in their frequency range and tempo rather than human music.\"\nOn the basis of their results, Teie has started selling cat songs online (at $1.99 per song) through a company called \"Music for Cats.\"\nDogs are a tougher audience, mostly because breeds vary widely in size, vocal range and heart rate. However, large dogs such as Labradors or mastiffs have vocal ranges that are quite similar to those of adult male humans. \"So, it is possible that they might be responsive to music in our frequency range. My prediction is that a big dog might be more responsive to human music than a smaller dog such as a Chihuahua,\" Snowdon said. [Dogs Play the Piano in New Video]\nIndeed, some dogs do appear to respond emotionally to human music. Research led by Deborah Wells, a psychologist at Queen's University Belfast, shows that dogs can discern between human music of different genres. \"Our own research has shown that dogs certainly behave differently in response to different types of music, e.g., showing behaviors more suggestive of relaxation in response to classical music and behaviors more suggestive of agitation in response to heavy metal music,\" Wells wrote in an email.\nConsidering the great demand for new ways to please our pets, more progress is likely to be made in the field of animal music. But no matter how well composers perfect their dog, cat and monkey songs, the animals will probably never appreciate their species-specific music quite as much as humans appreciate ours. According to Snowdon, they lack an important musical ability that we possess: relative pitch.\n\"We can recognize that a sequence of notes is the same whether it's in the key of F or A flat,\" he said. \"I have found that animals have very good absolute pitch, but they don't have relative pitch. They can learn to recognize a sequence of notes, but if you transpose the notes to a different key, so that the sequence uses the same relative notes but the key is different, they can't recognize the relationships between the notes anymore.\"\nHe added, \"To that extent, we understand music in a different way than animals do.\"<\/p>\n","answer_id":41850,"question_id":40660,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40660/why-do-we-like-music","last_activity_date":1451379896,"creation_date":1447626118,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why do we like music?","body":"<p>Music is, of course, just a sequence of sounds.

Main conclusion, taken from <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00326.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">the abstract<\/a>, is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The predominance of right-handed helical growth in climbing plants cannot be explained by hypotheses attempting to link plant growth behaviour and global location. One alternative hypothesis for our findings is that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of microtubule orientation operating at a subcellular level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To elaborate a little on that, remember that actin filaments as well as microtubules are all chiral polymers. That is, they form spiral structures with defined orientation. Even more, microtubules all start roughly from the nucleus away to membrane, so this might suggest cellular mechanism for preference toward twining chirality. However, this does not address your observation that given plant changes direction of growth twice.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31473,"question_id":31458,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc20bdaa2bbda327e40790844dafdd3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10204,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10204/cj-dennis","reputation":206,"display_name":"CJ Dennis"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1451199940,"creation_date":1451199940,"body":"<p>Having had a self-sown pumpkin grow in my back yard I can tell you what happened with the tendril in your picture.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tendril started growing straight, with a couple of branches.

Shortly after, the previously straight section of tendril began to contract, and in the process, to curl.<\/p>\n\n<p>Curling helps the contraction process hugely. For each rotation in one direction, another part of the tendril has to curl the other way, since both ends are now firmly attached to something (the ground and whatever the end touched).

The actual architecture of the charge transfer complex formed in the active site mediates the formal hydride transfer that produces NADPH*.
