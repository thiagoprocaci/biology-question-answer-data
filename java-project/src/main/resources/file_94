Work output (force X length) is a function of both. Power (work / time) involves both force, length change, and the shortening velocity. Shortening velocity is related to muscle fiber types.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a complex relationship between force output and length. In the graph below, the x-axis is relative length (1.0 being resting). When muscles operate outside a relatively narrow range (gray box), the cross-bridges are either too close together or too far apart to optimally generate force. When the muscle gets really stretched, force goes up, but only because passive tension (the intramuscular connective tissue is getting stretched) increases.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7HfZg.png\" alt=\"Force length curve\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The force-velocity curve below relates relative force output to how fast the muscle is shortening (which can be negative; i.e., lengthening contraction). The green part of the curve is muscle shortening. As velocity approaches 0, the muscle produces maximal shortening force. When the muscle goes into the red part of the curve, force is even higher. In order for a muscle to shorten very quickly, it can't produce a lot of force (far right).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/i6JcV.jpg\" alt=\"Force velocity curve\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/81/11/1810.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muscle fiber type<\/a> generally relates to both the force output of a muscle fiber and it's shortening velocity.

There were 5 test tubes with different concentrations of sucrose (0M,0.25M,0.5M,0.75M,1M); a small slice of potato was placed in each of them and left for 25 mins. When placed initially, all pieces of potato were at the bottom of the test tube. At around 8 mins, I noticed that the potato cell in the 0.75M and 1M solution begun to float. I'm assuming this is because water had left the cell from regions of low solute concentration to regions of high solute concentration and the density of the potato tuber cells in both these solutions became less than the density of water (lower mass to volume ratio).  However, at around 22 minutes, the cell in the 0.75M sucrose solution sunk to the bottom of the test tube. The only reason I can think of to explain this is that water flowed back into the now hypertonic cell, causing it to increase in mass and density. However, comparing the size of the potato tuber piece (1cm) and the volume of the test tube (20mL), this doesn't make sense.

The division by 2 and 4 are due to the probability that the (real) father and the mother transmit both the alleles coding for the disease.  This probability equals $$0.1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot (1-0.2)}{4} + \\frac{0.2^2}{2}\\right) = 0.01$$ This seems to be from far the most likely explanation!

They influence each other with signals and secreted messenger substances. If you look at a human embryo the state of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_potency#Totipotency\" rel=\"nofollow\">totipotency<\/a> (where all cells can differentiate into each cell type of the body) ends after 3-4 days when the blastocyte has developed. This structure already has a differentiation into a inner cell mass (embryoblast) and a outer cell layer (tropoblast).\nIf all cells would simply divide on their own, this would rather look like bacteria dividing in culture media, but not as a forming, multicellular organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>From these few cells in the beginning all cell types of the body have to develop (around 200, if I remember the number correctly). To reach this, the pluripotent stem cells need to proliferate and differentiate (develop into more specialized cell types) quite a lot. So embryonic stem cells do proliferate. Adult stem cells are not proliferating at the same rate a embryonic, but they still do. A good example are the melanocyte stem cells (which are already pretty specialized as they can only further differentiate into melanocytes) which replenish the melanocyte population of the hair bulb at the beginning of each hair cycle. Differentiated cells can divide as well, when necessary, think only about wound healing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Question 2: Stem cells (especially adult stem cells) need very defined living conditions. This includes specific signalling molecules (Oct or nanog are examples for that) to stay stem cells. If this signalling is missing (and it does in the normal human body) then these cells either differentiate or (more likely) die.\nThe only stem cell transplant which takes place regulary is the transfer of hematopoietic stem cells to leukemia patients.

I had some questions concerning stem cells that came up in the model.<\/p>\n\n<p>In an extremely simplified model of cell division, each cell decides what cells it will divide into with no output from the outside workd, including from neighboring cells. I also assume the time frame is small enough that cells do not die, and that there are only finitely many 'programs' telling different cells how to divide.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given these assumptions, I came to the conclusion that one of two things could happen:\n1. The number of cells grows exponentially, or\n2. Most cells will never divide into other cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, if growth is going to remain constant (e.g. 300,000,000 cells per month, every month in a sample), then eventually there will be two kinds of cells:\n1. Normal cells, which never divide, and\n2. 'Starter cells', which divide into normal cells but NEVER create other starter cells. The number of starter cells is eventually constant.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hypothesized that these starter cells would eventually be far outnumbered and become a very small part if the body proportionally. I hypothesized that hair follicles, nail roots, growth plates, and bone marrow contained starter cells. I further hypothesized that these are adult stem cells.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question 1: Is this what stem cells are? Are they the cells that divide to create other, non-dividing cells?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>After this, I realized that if the starter cells die, they would not be replaced under my model, because no cell is allowed to divide into new starter cells. I hypothesized that stem cell transplants fail because the host body kills off stem cells one by one and they can it be replaced. I also hypothesized that in the host, outside signals like hormones (which weren't allowed in my model) tell the body to create new stem cells as needed.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question 2: Do stem cell transplants fail because isolated stem cells do not replicate themselves?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, I noted above that the alternative to a bounded amount of stem cells is exponential growth, where stem cells divide into stem cells.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question 3: Do embryo stem cells divide into other stem cells exponentially?

It may take a few days/weeks to really see a large difference, but the level will go down. But, if you take a few flexible straws, put them in so the bendy part is submerged, the water level will drop much more quickly. (I'm not exactly sure if the bendy straw part is really that important here. Logically, I don't think it is, but I haven't done the experiment so I can't really say.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason the straws cause evaporation to happen more quickly is because as wind blows across the top of the straws, it pulls some of the water with it. And because, as the last person said, of cohesion and adhesion, the column of water is pulled up with it and thus it evaporates faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, these fluid mechanics are why toilets and siphoning work. When you siphon, you create a low pressure area inside the tube, like you are sucking out of a straw. Because of this low pressure, liquid is pulled into the tube. If you fill the tube with liquid, and turn the tube down toward the ground so the liquid starts coming out the end, the force of the liquid coming out of the tube creates low pressure in the tube again, thus causing more liquid to be sucked up.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is very similar to how trees work. In the stomata, or the pores in the leaves that allow the leaves to \"breathe,\" wind helps to pull the water out of the pores. But because of the decrease in pressure cause by the liquid being sucked out of the pore, water gets pulled up the tubes in the tree (xylem).<\/p>\n","answer_id":3378,"question_id":3365,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3365/how-do-trees-use-adhesion-and-cohesion-to-move-water-against-gravity","last_activity_date":1391446069,"creation_date":1346150408,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do trees use Adhesion and Cohesion to move water against gravity?","body":"<p>I have an AP Bio class where I have to name 3 properties of water and I chose adhesion and cohesion for one of them.

Cathepsin L was also present within the stroma particularly in the lateral decidualizing zone. Cystatin C, the major inhibitor of cathepsins, was shown to be a major product of the adjacent decidualizing stroma close to the embryo, suggesting a restraining role. After the completion of placental trophoblast invasion (day 11.5) the trophoblast cells express high levels of cystatin C, probably in association with a switch from an invasive cell type to one providing nutrients to the conceptus [35]. In addition, treatment of pregnant mice with E-64, a synthetic cysteine protease inhibitor, resulted in failure of implantation and normal uterine decidualization.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":14769,"question_id":14766,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14766/some-trophoblast-excreting-digestive-enzymes-in-implantation","last_activity_date":1391363554,"creation_date":1391269955,"answer_count":1,"title":"Some trophoblast excreting digestive enzymes in implantation","body":"<p>I found this paragraph in my study materials about implantation<\/p>\n\n<p>Original<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Simplest trophoblast excretes trypsin related substances and embedding consists of 3 stages:<\/p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>The blastocyst (composed of cytotrophoblast and embryoblast) stick to the uterine wall<\/li>\n  <li>Enzymes digest nische (little hole in the endometrium) to the functional layer and the blastocyst deepens in it.

Here is a distillation of my research. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is thought that the RHD gene may have arisen through a duplication of the adjacent RHCE gene. It seems that the possession of this gene (a D allele) confers a selective advantage in individuals suffering from toxoplasmosis (infection by the protozoan <em>Toxoplasma gondii<\/em>. Toxoplasmosis has an effect upon what is termed psychomotor performance, which is usually measured as reaction time. So, for example, it has been reported that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2692860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">there is an increased incidence of road traffic accidents amongst those suffering from (asymptomatic) toxoplasmosis<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://web.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/pdf/rh.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heterozygosity at RHD seems to reduce this effect of toxoplasmosis.<\/a> So, the current theory is that the D allele appeared in humans because of the prevalence of toxoplasmosis, with the selective disadvantage of haemolytic disease of the newborn being balanced by the heterozygote advantage (similar to the malaria/sickle cell anaemia interaction). There is currently no biochemical explanation of why the RHD gene product has this effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a region with a very low risk of toxoplasmosis there would be a strong selection for the (ancestral?) dd genotype since these individuals have the best reaction time of all (when not infected). The definitive hosts (i.e. where the parasite reproduces) of <em>Toxoplasma gondii<\/em> are cats, and these were rare in Europe before the domestication of cats.

To <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2607568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">do it well<\/a>, you need wide coverage on your mutation site. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think that it is possible that there could be a difference with a mismatch in the middle of a primer, but it wouldn't be as obvious as if it were closer to the 3' end.  Unless there was some serious reason why you couldn't put it there (ie Tm below 45 on the reference) that sounds like poor primer design.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will note I am certainly not a qPCR expert, and I don't think the question has been directly researched (as you surmised).  Again when I've looked for Indels before (was doing some interesting stuff with HLA types...) we used larger primers for the qPCR.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If this doesn't answer your question satisfactory, is there an initial reference you would have us look at?  I imagine things like good quenching and other factors could pull out some significance when comparing two templates (one with indel one without), but again, it's kind of odd to put the mutation in the middle.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit to comments:\n1: I think the Cq delay is going to depend on things like length, sequence, and mutation.  There may be a grand scheme formula/algorithm to predict the delay, but I don't know of one, and I couldn't find it if it does exist.  Most of the graphs and differences I've seen have been big enough that it convinced me that it was significant.  I don't know if this is like flow where you can sit and argue all day about the biological relevance of 40% to 30% of a particular group.<\/p>\n\n<p>2: Sorry I didn't have time to come in and give an adequate summery of them.  They are, as you pointed out, tangential to what you're trying to do, but do in fact address the problem through their methods.  I will attempt a better summery as I have time (I've got a grant on I'm trying to get done by Tuesday, so probably after that).  If you have any clarifications to the question to add, please do.<\/p>\n\n<p>3: This may have grown from the general perception that it was needed, and that I aim for the highest Tm I can generally manage without structure problems being introduced.  I also have the luxury of not needing to worry over the cost of ulta-mers.

I can give an example (I need to explain a bit wider for it) to show this:<\/p>\n\n<p>The expression of genes is dependent on many different signals, some come from the outside of the cell (for example from growth factors) and they are passed down into the nucleus along so called signal transduction pathways.\nFor melanoma (skin cancer) mutations in some key elements of this pathways are pretty often mutated, for example we find mutations in one kinase (an enzyme that phosphorylates other proteins) in about 60% of the cases. This kinase is called Braf and it carries a mutations in amino acid 600 changing it from valine to glutamic acid (so call Braf-V600E). This makes the kinase permanently active (also when she shouldn't be activated due to a missing signal) which derugulates otherwise pretty tightly controlled gene expression.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem with the Braf-V600E mutation is that this is not only found in melanoma cells, but also in benign nevi. Only that these are usually senescent (meaning that they do not divide and only sit on the skin) and harmless. Most of them never transform into melanoma, but some do and here we don't know why. Obviously cells need to pick up other mutations on their way to become cancer cells and there are quite some possibilities for that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cancer is a pretty complex disease, which is under high selection pressure: Cells need to evade the immune system and also be able to survive, proliferate and differentiate. Whole genome sequencing has opened a door to understand cancers better and also to diagnose them better in terms of treatment, but I don't think you can really do this only on the base of a sequence, since there a too many possibilities to bring up false positive (and also negative) results.\nIts possible that the Cancer genome project will change this, but I am doubtful about it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14772,"question_id":14747,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1391294020}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14747/detecting-cancer-or-a-genetic-predisposition-based-on-dna-sequencing","last_activity_date":1391294020,"creation_date":1391206024,"answer_count":2,"title":"Detecting cancer or a genetic predisposition based on DNA sequencing","body":"<p>I am not by any means a biologist - so go easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>What would be a method for determining whether or not a patient has cancer based only on a genomic sequence?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong> Thanks for the help in revising the questions.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What information is extractable once a genome has been sequenced?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Is it possible to derive whether or not a person has cancer based only on the genome which was sequenced? i.e. Are there anomalies to look out for to detect the cancer.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","question_id":14747,"tags":["dna","dna-sequencing","cancer"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":14772,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":84,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1391291130},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11868bf66250754fd3f37f6ad276ba91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3942,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3942/richard-webb","reputation":48,"display_name":"Richard Webb"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":9125,"edited":false,"creation_date":1391287563,"comment_id":19709,"body":"Two comments on this from my lab experience with transforming bacteria: Making cells competent (I usually use chemical competent cells since we have no electroporator in our lab) is not a hard thing to do.

Upon binding, ErbB2 changes its conformation, phosphorylates itself (meaning it adds phosphogroups to specific amino acids of the protein) which leads phosphorylation (and therefore activation) of other proteins, which finally results in changed expression of genes, which are involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (see this reference: \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15142631\" rel=\"nofollow\">Review of epidermal growth factor receptor biology.<\/a>\"). <\/p>\n\n<p>This leads to the second part of your question what pathway means in this context: The sequence of different molecules which start at the receptor and finally induces changes of gene expression in the cells nucleus are called pathway.

Copying, copying, a few molecules become a multitude, and evolution spreads in all directions, to the more and to the less complex. But when a new level of complexity arises, it usually allows a new size, and a bigger organism can, for instance, eat a smaller organism. Once this level is achieved, it tends to be mantained. Again some copies will lead to smaller lineages, but the big ones have founded a niche that will not disappear by itself (it may take an asteroid).

As mentioned already, the benefits of the kits are that they are easy, safe, and (most importantly) how almost every actual lab does plasmid purification these days. <\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest criticism of the commercial kits is that you can get by easily without knowing anything about what is actually happening in the tube. However, as noted in the comments to Nick T's answer, there is no secret proprietary technology in the kits--they use the <em>alkaline lysis<\/em> method. This means that you can still teach the mechanism in the class while getting the benefit of the spin columns.<\/p>\n\n<p>One option, for teaching purposes, is to make all of your own solutions and just use the spin columns on the supernatant after pelleting the precipitated membrane/protein. That way, you get the benefit of insisting on real names for the solutions (NaOH is a more educational name than P2) and you get to use the spin columns in place of the ethanol precipitation. I believe there are cheap sources that just sell the spin columns, although I have never used them. You want to avoid the ethanol precipitation because it adds a bare minimum of 30 minutes to the protocol (for my protocols, it was more like an 1.5 hours or more). And waiting for ethanol to evaporate so you can resuspend is like watching paint dry unless you have a speed vac.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yield shouldn't be a big issue in a class situation, but you can boost yield with the column by prolonging the final elution step. I think the given instruction is to let the TE buffer (Tris) \"elute\" for 1 minute before the final spin, but I have routinely let the TE sit for about 15-30 minutes before spinning down. The difference in yield blew out the exposure on the gel camera.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are certain cases where phenol:chloroform extractions are still desirable, but this is definitely not one of them. I used to do P:Cs routinely when working with RNA and yeast genomic DNA. I have never seen anyone do anything other than a miniprep when preparing plasmids. What's more, the hassle of working in a fume hood and the risk of phenol burns encouraged <em>a lot<\/em> of people in the lab to prefer the spin kits even when working with genomic DNA.<\/p>\n","answer_id":283,"question_id":38,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a13bac8a0f0baa528f2e89da7e4e1b74?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":5595,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5595/george","reputation":1,"display_name":"George"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1391221523,"creation_date":1391221523,"body":"<p>To save cost, you can buy spin columns alone from suppliers such as Syd Labs (<a href=\"http://www.sydlabs.com/spin-column-for-plasmid-miniprep-p110.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sydlabs.com/spin-column-for-plasmid-miniprep-p110.htm<\/a>) and make home-made buffers.

I would like to go more into detail about the modeling decisions and benefits of assuming weak selection and why it is done in the literature.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you are making evolutionary models, especially one in evolutionary game theory, the first place is to <strong>start with a differential equations model of inviscid populations<\/strong> (this usually means that you assume very large population size). These models often result in dynamics of the form $\\dot{x}_i = x_if_i(\\vec{x})$ where $f_i$ is a non-linear function corresponding to the relative fitness but where the non-linearity depends on the strength of selection. Making a weak-selection argument, often <strong>allows you to come close to linearizing $f_i$ using Taylor expansion<\/strong>. This reducese your equations to a form like $\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_i(\\vec{c}_i^T\\vec{x} - \\phi)$ where $\\phi$ is an average fitness. Although the transients of this dynamic are still complicated, the equilibrium is usually relatively easy to analyze and reduces to looking at the matrix $C = [\\vec{c}_i^T]_{1 \\leq i \\leq n}$ with its columns given by your linearization of the $f_i$s.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is only a first step, and the current trend in the literature is to <strong>move to a setting where you have <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/spatial-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">spatial structure<\/a><\/strong>. Here, weak selection gives you a further bonus because you can use it to separate the timescales of local (dominated by the constant term) and global (dominated by first-order in $w$ -- the selection strength) network dynamics. This allows you to use the powerful <a href=\"http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/11229/1037\">pair-approximation technique<\/a>.

Clotting activation from tissue factor (TF) is known as the extrinsic pathway, so you've got that one right. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The intrinsic pathway doesn't involve FX<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The intrinsic pathway does not (as often misunderstood) refer to the clotting cascade downstream of factor X (FX) which involves FV, FVIII and thrombin. Rather, the intrinsic pathway is a system which is able to initiate the clotting cascade without any tissue factor being present. It is triggered by the assembly of high molecular weight kininogen, prekallikrein and FXII on collagen. This is also known as <em>contact activation<\/em>, and sets off a small cascade producing active FIX (FIXa), which can then assemble with circulating FVIIa in order to produce FXa and thereby set off the rest of the clotting system.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The extrinsic and intrinsic pathway are separate ways towards a \"common pathway\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So think of it this way: The extrinsic pathway produces FXa in one way (TF), the intrinsic pathway produces FXa in a different way (HMWK+prekallikrein+FXII). There isn't really any interaction between these two. Once FXa is produced from either of these two, it will start to set off what you could call the \"common pathway\", i.e. it will produce thrombin, which will activate co-factors that will then lead to more production of FXa and propel the entire thing forward faster and faster until it reaches what we know as the thrombin peak.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The intrinsic pathway is not important for haemostasis in humans<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Aside from this, you should know that the intrinsic pathway exists, but it doesn't bear much significance in a living human. This is demonstrated by genetic FXII deficiency - you would expect it to produce haemophilia if FXII and therefore the intrinsic pathway was important (just like FVIII and FIX), but it doesn't (read here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_XII#Role_in_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_XII#Role_in_disease<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The principle behind the initiation pathways and the common pathway<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So to summarise: You fell victim to a misunderstanding and a bad explanation on that site you linked. The extrinsic pathway doesn't \"turn itself off\", and the intrinsic pathway doesn't \"take over\". What really happens in a human is that the intrisic pathway doesn't really do anything. Rather, the extrinsic pathway will produce a little bit of active FXa. But that is enough to produce a little bit of thrombin. And that bit of thrombin will then produce small amounts of FIXa and co-factors (FV and FVIII). These will start to produce more FXa, which will produce more thrombin, which will produce more FIXa and co-factors, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>What the article you refer to is trying to mention are the inhibitory systems that will be set off alongside all of this. Think about it - if thrombin increases its own production perpetually, how does it know when to stop? These systems which ensure that clotting does stop are known as anticoagulation pathways. They are just as amazing as the coagulation pathways themselves, and they are extremely well-geared towards shutting off exactly the right clotting factors at exactly the right time, to ensure that a clot forms in the wound but only there and nowhere else.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit<\/strong>: It turns out people do use more complicated definitions of \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" - the problem being once again that everybody can define words as they like. This is rather based on the distinguishing of the two ten-ases, TF-FVII (extrinsic tenase) and FIX-FVIII (intrinsic tenase). In this understanding, the physiological process does indeed start off by the extrinsic pathway (i.e. mechanisms which generate extrinsic tenase), which will kick off the amplification cascade of the intrinsic pathway (i.e. which produces intrinsic tenase). It is true that this way, the contribution of the \"extrinsic pathway\" is minor once the \"intrinsic pathway\" is active, but even so, it does not \"shut itself off\". What turns the extrinsic pathway off is the layer of material which gets deposited on top of the exposed subendothelial surface, preventing access to TF!<\/p>\n","answer_id":14539,"question_id":14529,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1391166881}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14529/prothrombin-time-when-extrinsic-pathway-is-turned-off","last_activity_date":1391166881,"creation_date":1390150175,"answer_count":1,"title":"Prothrombin time when extrinsic pathway is turned off","body":"<p>I was searching for an answer that \"why do we need intrinsic pathway when there is fast extrinsic pathway\" and i found the answer in the following link:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pathologystudent.com/?p=3197\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pathologystudent.com/?p=3197<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>It says that the factor X produced in the extrinsic pathway turns off the extrinsic pathway and activates the intrinsic pathway.

If you create a regression between \"intelligence\" and \"need of being intelligent\"(supposing it means something!) in terrestrial mammals and add the dolphin on your graph, you might be surprised that the dolphin does not fit on the regression but it might only be due to the fact that they live in water which is much more dense than air so that it is less costly to carry a big brain.

Definition one is a bit more naive, and I tend to use it when teaching or trying to explain phenotype to a layman: anything you can observe is a phenotype.  Under this definition, having red hair is a phenotype, not having red hair (or, more directly, having black, brown, blonde, etc. hair) is a phenotype, but carrying the recessive gene for red hair is not a phenotype.  I can observe without checking your genome that you do or don't have red hair, I cannot tell without checking your genome that you have one copy of the recessive gene for red hair.<\/p>\n\n<p>Definition two is more complete, and I tend to use it more in a lab research setting: anything that is the OUTCOME of a genotype can be defined as a phenotype.  Again, red hair and not red hair (meaning brown, black, blonde, etc) are outcomes defined by the genotype.  However, depending on the context (let's say I'm interested in understanding heritable potential and not the color of hair) I'd say that the phenotypes would be 1) the ability to pass on red hair to progeny (outcomes of genotypes RR, RN, RN in your example), and 2) lack of ability to pass on red hair to progeny (outcome of genotype NN in your example).  In both cases, the phenotype is the outcome of the underlying genes, I just have to make sure I frame my scientific context appropriately.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14730,"question_id":14696,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14696/does-a-phenotype-include-the-presence-of-a-recessive-gene","last_activity_date":1391100023,"creation_date":1390967190,"answer_count":4,"title":"Does a phenotype include the presence of a recessive gene","body":"<p>I am trying to understand what exactly a phenotype is to try and understand a genetics database.

These gates are called the <em>activation gate<\/em> (on the extracellular side) and the <em>inactivation gate<\/em> on the intracellular side.

There is no influx of sodium. Owing to a neurotransmitter release, there is depolarization of the plasma membrane around the channel. As soon as the potential reaches a fixed threshold value, there is a change in the conformation of the sodium channel. The voltage is sensed by a <a href=\"http://courses.washington.edu/conj/membrane/nachan.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">biophysical voltage sensor<\/a>, a part of the channel.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>At the <strong>threshold potential<\/strong>, both the gates respond by reversing their state. But owing to the biophysical structure, the response of the activation gate is faster than the response of the inactivation gate. What happens is that the activation gate quickly opens allowing the influx of sodium ions, generating the action potential. The inactivation gate is closing but before it closes, the activation gate has been open for some time and the action potential is already fired due to considerable depolarization. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>After some time, the inactivation gate also closes completely, blocking the sodium influx. By this time, the potential is at the peak of the action potential, the potassium channels have opened, and the <strong>re-polarisation phase<\/strong> begins. Here the inactivation gate is closed, thouh the activation gate is still open above the threshold potential. As the potential dips below the threshold, again the gates reverse their states but they respond with different speeds. First, the activation gate closes while the inactivation gate is still closed, and then the inactivation gate opens.

Once a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound\">lead compound<\/a> is identified, it is put through a series of biochemical assays to determine, for example, if it inhibits certain enzymes of interest. From there, it moves into testing by cell-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay\">assays<\/a> using both normal cells and disease-specific models. All the while, investigators are looking for high specific activity (potency), low toxicity, and minimal off-target effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a compound or group of them looks promising in these <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro\"><em>in vitro<\/em><\/a> assays, experiments then move into animal models.

I recently learned that I have Rh- blood (I'm A-), and was idly looking into blood types on Wikipedia. I was surprised to find that relatively few (~15% of all) humans have it, and most of those seem to be European. Looking just a little further, I found a bunch of crackpot-looking sites that try to explain how people got Rh- blood, and what weird abilities they possess as a result.<\/p>\n\n<p>I managed to find one site that seemed at least less laughable, which suggested that interbreeding with <em>Homo neanderthalensis<\/em> (or possibly <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis<\/em>, since the site seemed to indicate that there was some question about how different <em>H. s. sapiens<\/em> were from <em>H. neanderthalensis<\/em>) might have accounted for the introduction of the condition.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems that from more reputable (medical) sources, the only difference between Rh+ and Rh- is that complications can arise during pregnancy if the mother is Rh- and the fetus is Rh+. Indeed, most sites (e.g., WebMD) seem to explicitly state that there are no other differences of note.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not a biologist, or an anthropologist, or a life-science kind of guy at all. However, as a computer scientist, I like to think that I have both an open mind but one which demands scientific and/or logico-mathematical evidence for claims. Lots of the pseudo-scientific, paranormal, etc. theories on the web I basically dismiss out of hand, as explanations which are almost certainly fantasies, but most definitely baseless and untestable.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What, if any, is the current scientific understanding of the origin, or source, of rhesus negative blood in human beings? Do individuals with Rh- blood have any common (in a statistically significant sense) characteristics or health issues, aside from the issue with pregnancy and tending to be more European than not? Is there anything to continuing to look into this?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For context, I got started down this rabbit hole while looking into different dieting strategies, and found the \"blood type diet\". Just as an aside, I don't think there's a lot of merit to that diet... sounds like a fad thing. Any sources or information or help on this subject are appreciated.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT:<\/p>\n\n<p>I have been looking a little more, and I stumbled across a paper entitled, \"The influence of RhD phenotype on toxoplasmosis and age-associated changes in personality profile of blood donors\" which looks at the effect of the Rh- trait on personality changes caused by toxoplasmosis (if you Google the title, you should be able to download). Using Cloninger's and Cattel's personality factors, they seem to show a variety of things, including (a) personality differences between Rh+ and Rh- individuals not affected by toxoplasmosis, and (b) different reactions to prolonged toxoplasmosis affection in Rh+ and Rh- individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>I didn't even know that parasites could affect your behavior; that seems frightening on the one hand, but on the other, it's fascinating if it's for real, especially since the incidence of toxoplasmosis is not insignificant in most people. Anybody who knows anything about this or who reads the paper and can help me understand what it's saying would be doing me a great favor to answer/comment/chat.

But the same cannot be said for the pure breeding white variety, as it can still be homozygous recessive at Gene A and heterozygous at Gene B, it would still exhibit white flowers in all of its progeny after any number of generations. <\/p>\n\n<p>But the fact that all the progeny of the cross between white and the magenta variety turns out to be red, removes the possibility of the white variety being heterozygous, as that would have produced atleast some magenta plants. Since all were red, we can be certain of the genotype of both the parents, and consequently of the F1 progeny.   <\/p>\n\n<p>This solves your first question. The second question needs the extrapolation of the information gathered while solving the first question into a Punnett square and a simple probability calculation. The third question is a factual question, but it must be mentioned, that this particular type of interaction can be classified under more than one type, and hence a single answer would not be possible for your third question.  <\/p>\n\n<p>ADDENDUM<br>\nThe third question is actually a bit difficult to answer. The phenotypes will be $\\text{A*B*}$=Red, $\\text{A*bb}$=Magenta, $\\text{aa**}$=white. This gives us $9:3:4$ for Red:Magenta:white. Now the fact that recessive at one locus , Gene A, suppresses the phenotype altogether no matter what the genotype at the other locus, means that one of the phenomenon exhibited is recessive epistasis, where Gene A is the epistatic loci and Gene B is the Hypostatic loci. But, the fact that there are two distinct phenotypes with the epistatic gene dominant, means the interaction is not <a href=\"http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/biology/notes-on-duplicate-polymeric-complementary-and-supplementary-genes/12042/\" rel=\"nofollow\">complementary ($9:7$) but is supplementary ($9:3:4$)<\/a>. This distinction is necessary, and it essentially means that the \"intermediate\" of the elucidated pathway is also coloured. Otherwise, like in Flower colour in <em>Lathyrus Odoratus<\/em>, the phenotypes of $\\text{aa**}$ and $\\text{A*bb}$ are same, and hence the phenotypic ration remains $9:7$. For a ratio of $13:3$ you need domianant epistasis <em>and<\/em> the phenotypes of double recessive and the epistatic recessive must match. Here, it is recessive epistasis, as the recessive condition at one locus suppresses the expression a other, and not dominant.

This means that while normal women have two X chromosomes, Turner women have only one, and nothing else.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome\">Klinefelter syndrome<\/a> happens when one of the gametes retains an extra copy of the X chromosome. This way a Klinefelter man has two X chromosomes and Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see - the Turner woman is lacking some genetic information, while the Klinefelter man has too much of it. Generally, having too much genetic information is much easier to survive than not having enough of it, so this explains the relative difference on the most basic level.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, you might say, what about Barr's bodies? Don't the women use only one X chromosome in each cell? And wasn't Y chromosome almost empty? <\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, these are an important consideration for these two syndromes. In each cell of a women's body one of the X chromosomes is inactivated and folded into a Barr's body. This inactivation is random, so part of the cells keep mother's and part of the cells keep father's X chromosome active. The trick is that the Barr body is not entirely inactive (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136209/\">Genes That Escape From X Inactivation<\/a>). Only about 15% of the genes are active, but just the lack of them is mostly lethal (Turner fetuses are usually aborted, Wikipedia quotes olny 1% surviving until birth), and accounts for the health problems and deformations in Turner women.<\/p>\n\n<p>A Klinefelter man has two X chromosomes in addition to his Y chromosome, so one of the chromosomes inactivates into a Barr body. The presence of Y chromosome directs his body to develop into a male pattern, but at the same time, the existence of Barr's body with those still active genes, causes his body to develop also feminine features.

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The cold water can cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction, the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body. For people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. Inhalation of water (and thus drowning) may result from hyperventilation. Some people, due to body type or mental conditioning, are much better able to survive swimming in very cold water.\" <strong>But<\/strong>: \" A person who survives the initial minute of trauma (after falling into icy water), can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they don't drown.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Sudden heat at entering sauna - I am not sure, but probably it also may cause heart attacks.
