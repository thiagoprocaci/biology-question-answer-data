My take on this is that there is indeed a very close relationship between inbreeding and speciation, but that inbreeding actually PRECEDES speciation ! The key to this rather counter-intuitive point of view is that inbreeding actually has several advantages, including that of resulting in cleaner genomes in those offspring that survive inbreeding depression. <\/p>\n\n<p>In populations that have high degrees of inbreeding, because of, for example, small sizes of populations, or high tendencies to self fertilisation, the recessive mutations that cause inbreeding depression will be progressively eliminated, and there will consequently be very little inbreeding depression. <\/p>\n\n<p>In such a context, there will thus be no barrier to exploiting other advantages of inbreeding such as reducing the cost of sex, or keeping together advantageous gene combinations.

We also assume random mating in order to use hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.<\/p>\n\n<p>---- <em>calculations<\/em> ----<\/p>\n\n<p>The mean fitness is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\bar W = x^2W_{11} + 2x(1-x)W_{12} + (1-x)^2W_{22}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The variance of fitness is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma^2 = x^2(W_{11}-\\bar W)^2 + 2x(1-x)(W_{12}-\\bar W)^2 + (1-x)^2(W_{22}-\\bar W)^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>We then want to calculate the covariance between father and son with respect to fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose first that the father is $A_1A_1$ Then the son will be $A_1A_1$ if the mother transmits an $A_1$ gene to him, an event with probability x. Similarly the son will be $A_1A_2$ with probability $1-x$. The father himself will be $A_1A_1$ with probability $x^2$. Continuing this wa it is possible to draw up a table of the probabilities of the various father-son combinations in genotype and hence fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, assuming no change in frequency of $A1$ between the two generations, the covariance father-son is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$cov = x^3W_{11}^2 + 2x^2(1-x)W_{11}W_{12} + x(1-x)W_{12}^2 + 2x(1-x)^2W_{12}W_{22} + (1-x)^3W_{22}^2-\\bar W^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>which also equals<\/p>\n\n<p>$$cov = x(1-x)(xW_{11} + (1-2x)W_{12} - (1-x)W_{22})^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The correlation between the two fitnesses is found by dividing the co-variance by the variance (since the variance of sons is the same as that for fathers):<\/p>\n\n<p>$$cor = \\frac{x(1-x)(xW_{11} + (1-2x)W_{12} - (1-x)W_{22})^2}{\\sigma ^2}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>We then define dominance and additive variance:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma_D^2 = x^2(1-x)^2(2*W_{12} - W_{11} - W_{22})^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma_A^2 = 2x(1-x)(xW_{11}+(1-2x)W_{12} - (1-x)W_{22})^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>such as<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma_D^2 + \\sigma_A^2  = \\sigma$$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>My question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The slope of a parent-offspring regression equals the heritability in the narrow sense $h^2_N$. <\/p>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken the heritability in the narrow sense is defined as $h_N^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_A^2}{\\sigma}$<\/p>\n\n<p>We defined above that the correlation between parents and offspring is $cor = \\frac{cov}{\\sigma}$.

Especially where the new amino acid has similar properties to the one it has replaced.<\/li>\n<li>Even when a mutation does alter the protein function, or render the product non-functional, in many cases this will not impact fitness since fitness is conditional on the environment in which it is measured and not all genes impact all environments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So the distribution, whatever it is, will have a large spike at 0.

Damage to these genes allows a cell to divide in the absence of signals to divide and also forget to check that it's DNA isn't damaged before replicating. This is then passed on to the daughter cancer cells. As each check is removed the cell permits more and more mutations meaning more and more likelihood for the next mutation to occur.

Taking your example of the thyroid gland let's take a look at it. <\/p>\n\n<p>The hypothalamus produces TRH which acts on the anterior pituitary causing it to release TSH which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones T3 and T4. <\/p>\n\n<p>Abnormal levels of thyroid hormone may be caused by problems in any one of the three stages.

In a patient with a primary or thyroid gland problem we expect high levels of thyroid hormones but low levels of TSH. The pituitary gland is trying its best to tell the thyroid gland, \"No more!\" but it won't listen. In secondary or pituitary disease, the pituitary gland is the bully pushing the thyroid gland to make lots of thyroid hormone by over production of TSH. Usually there are other hormone disturbances too in this case as the pituitary gland has a range of hormones it secretes. Also the swollen pituitary gland puts pressure on the nerves carrying vision leading to visual loss (specifically in the temporal fields). In this case the hypothalamus will be secreting low levels of TRH (which isn't routinely measured) trying to get the pituitary gland to stop acting out. The rarest situation is when the hypothalamus has the problem where every hormone is increased. However again this will be causes by something or the other detectable usually on imaging. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the short answer is yes, but there will be other features. Primary or end organ dysfunction is most common and will cause characteristic findings in blood tests and examination (e.g. swollen thyroid gland) but secondary and tertiary disease can be figured out when other features are found in association. <\/p>\n","answer_id":16241,"question_id":16227,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16227/nervous-system-organ-or-gland-failure","last_activity_date":1396221879,"creation_date":1396204490,"answer_count":1,"title":"Nervous System : Organ or Gland Failure","body":"<p>If an organ was to start failing, not total failure, such as the thyroid gland, is it possible that the fault may not lie in the failure of the organ but in the nerve signals coming from the brain?<\/p>\n","question_id":16227,"tags":["neuroscience"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":16241,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user6193"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIrIa.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5922,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5922/playsdice","reputation":646,"display_name":"PlaysDice"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1396215205,"creation_date":1396057233,"body":"<p>HSV-1 has evolved mechanisms to thwart the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae#Immune_system_evasions\" rel=\"nofollow\">immune system's surveillance<\/a>.

By preventing this, mycobacteria can evade part of the immune system - part of the reason why TB is so hard to clear once acquired.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16230,"question_id":16197,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16197/can-inhibition-of-lymphocytes-migration-be-a-direct-cause-of-chronic-inflammatio","last_activity_date":1396207380,"creation_date":1396109244,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can inhibition of lymphocytes migration be a direct cause of chronic inflammation?","body":"<p>Here is the original slide:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62073194/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-30%20at%2015.42.20.png\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I am thinking about the \"cord factor\" sentence in a more general case.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assume you inhibit Leucocytes migration.\n<strong>How does this lead to accumulation of macrophages in the site of infection?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":16197,"tags":["microbiology","pathogenesis","inflammation","chronic"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":16230,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1396205034},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user6116"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1396206715,"creation_date":1396206715,"body":"<p>No, since the pH and the conditions are different in the different compartments (stomach, small intestine, colon) of the bowel.\nSee this figure (taken from this <a href=\"http://altered-states.net/barry/update178/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website<\/a>) for the differences:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JipUR.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>There are not that much bacteria in the stomach, so even even nothing else than acidic stuff comes out, the bacteria are not affected.

All of this will change the effects on the brain. Also, there are several confounding factors, some of which I have tried to list.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have summarized here a few information about ethanol metabolism, taken mostly from <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=k7BInEQ-iqgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157\" rel=\"nofollow\">Principles of Forensic Toxicology<\/a> - Chapter 10 by Barry Levine and Yale H. Caplan<\/p>\n\n<p>Ethanol is normally taken through drinking, which means that it will have to pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (i.e. stomach and intestine) before getting into the bloodstream. This route permits practically 100% of absorption of ethanol in the body, with the major site of absorption being the small intestine, absorbing ~75% of a dose of ethanol. The rest will be absorbed in the stomach and in the other parts of the intestine.<\/p>\n\n<p>The absorption in the GI tract is dependent on the type of beverage: for instance carbonated alcoholic beverages are absorbed faster than \"plain\" ones. \nThe alcohol content also is important: a very diluted drink is absorbed slower than one with 10-30% of ethanol, as the latter will generate a bigger concentration gradient between the GI tract and the circulation, so it will diffuse faster. However, >30% ethanol will enhance mucus formation, which will slow down absorption. Furthermore, absorption depends on the status of the GI tract: preexisting conditions (e.g. inflammation) can modify the rate at which the alcohol enters the bloodstream.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, we are still far away from the brain! After being absorbed, ethanol goes into the vena cava, and passes through the liver, where it can be metabolized (destroyed) by an enzyme called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dehydrogenase\" rel=\"nofollow\">alcohol dehydrogenase<\/a> (ADH), which converts ethanol into acetaldheyde, effectively reducing the ethanol concentration in the blood. \nThis is a well-known phenomenon for many drugs, and it is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">first pass effect<\/a>\nImportantly, the human stomach also expresses ADH, so this first pass effect can start even before reaching the liver! The effects of ADH in the stomach obviously depends on how long the ethanol stays in there. So, it will be lower for an empty stomach then after a big meal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Food, in fact, is also a well known factor that reduces the amount of ethanol in the blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, these graphs show blood ethanol content in four healthy subjects after a 10 hour fast (filled circles) or after breakfast (empty circles), after drinking the same dose of 0.80 g ethanol/kg body weight, in 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FLK2L.jpg\" alt=\"Blood EtOH levels and food\"><br>\nFrom: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8064267\" rel=\"nofollow\">Food-Induced Lowering of Blood-Ethanol Profiles and Increased Rate of Elimination Immediately After a Meal<\/a> - Jones AW and J√∂nsson KA - <em>J Forensic Sci.<\/em>, <strong>1994<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, eating strongly decrease the ethanol blood content. Also see how there is quite a bit of variation between the different subjects (if you open the paper you will also see the graphs from other 6 subjects).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, you can look for instance at this paper (just got a random study, there seems to be a ton of them around):\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8974331\" rel=\"nofollow\">First pass metabolism of ethanol.<\/a> - Lieber CS et al. - <em>Alcohol Alcohol Suppl.<\/em>, <strong>1994<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Coming out of the liver, ethanol goes into the right side of the hearth, and from there to the lungs. This poses no particular issue for most drugs, but ethanol is volatile! So, part of the ethanol is released through respiration (in fact the \"classic\" way of saying if someone has drunk alcohol is to smell his breath). However, this only accounts for a minor decrease in blood ethanol levels. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, ethanol can start going around the body. Being a water-soluble molecule it will tend to diffuse into water-containing parts of our body (i.e. you will not find much ethanol in fat), which include the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, however, the process of elimination has started: ethanol can be excreted in urine, sweat and breath, although the major route of elimination is epathic metabolism by ADH, accounting for >90% of ethanol elimination.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a neat formula to express all of this, called the Widmark equation:<\/p>\n\n<p>$A=\\frac{Wr(C_t+\\beta*t)}{0.8z}$<\/p>\n\n<p>where<\/p>\n\n<p>$A$ = number of drinks consumed<br>\n$W$ = body weight (important because of the content of water in the body)<br>\n$r$ = Widmark constant (depends on sex, age, etc.)<br>\n$C_t$ = blood ethanol concentration at time t<br>\n$\\beta$ = acohol elimination rate<br>\n$t$ = time since the first drink<br>\n$z$ = volume of alcohol per drink  <\/p>\n\n<p>You can find examples of this formula in <a href=\"http://www.wsp.wa.gov/breathtest/docs/webdms/Studies_Articles/Widmarks%20Equation%2009-16-1996.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this PDF about Widmark equations<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>And now to the brain: ethanol does indeed have various effects on neurons. Short term effect essentially involve depression of neuronal activity, ethanol being able to modulate GABA signalling in the brain. Long term effect range from reduced neurogenesis (i.e. birth of new neurons) to reduced volume of certain brain areas, probably due to loss of neurons, to inflammation in the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, the situation is very complex and it depends on the frequency of drinking, the amount of each drink and many other factors. A single dose of ethanol will probably have irrelevant effects on your neurons... as the amount needed (in one shot) for serious neurotoxicity will probably send you into ethilic coma. The exact mechanisms for these effects are only partially known and very likely to be derived by the interaction of numerous diverse effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>This article explains some of the mechanisms for loss of neurons in the cerebellum.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18418667\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechanisms of ethanol-induced degeneration in the developing, mature, and aging cerebellum.<\/a> - Jaatinen and Rintala - <em>Cerebellum<\/em>, <strong>2008<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These mechanisms include: (i) excitotoxicity; (ii) dietary factors, especially thiamine depletion; (iii) glial abnormalities; (iv) changes in growth factors; (v) apoptotic mechanisms; (vi) oxidative stress; and (vii) compromised energy production.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I will not go into the details of all of this, but it should be clear by now that all the things I mentioned so far (and many other factors I did not talk about) make it <strong>extremely difficult to give an exact quantification of the number of cells killed by ethanol<\/strong>.

The maintenance of Biodiversity occurs through a dynamic process of speciations and extinctions allowed thanks to mutations, selection, population structure and movements. Standard ideas of conservation is not to preserve these processes but to prevent extinctions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quite a lot of many in conservation is aimed to save some big and representative species.

I assume (although I have no reference!) that the current number of invasive species is particularly high and just like any other disturbance in ecosystem, we can hardly predict what will the consequences.

You should talk with your physician and/or pharmacist on a case by case basis when determining whether to take a drug and how to dose it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We should consider that most pharmaceutical forms are made up from two main components: the active ingredient(s) and the excipients.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>active pharmaceutical ingredient<\/strong><\/a> is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the substance in a pharmaceutical drug or a pesticide that is biologically active.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the part of the drug that actually \"does the job\". Note that the dosage on the package refer to this, not the weight of the pill! For instance 500mg aspirin will contain 500mg of the active principle (acetylsalicylic acid) but the pill itself will weight more than 500mg.<\/p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>excipient<\/strong><\/a> is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an inactive substance formulated alongside the active ingredient (\"API\") of a medication, for the purpose of bulking-up formulations that contain potent active ingredients (thus often referred to as \"bulking agents,\" \"fillers,\" or \"diluents\"). <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This does not normally have biological effects, but allows you, for instance, to have a pill that is of sufficient size to be easy to take in your hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you split a pill in half <strong>you are assuming that each half contains the same amount of active ingredient<\/strong>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is regulated by the Pharmacopoeia*. In particular when looking at the <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/phint/en/d/Jb.6.2.1.7/#docfirsthighlight\" rel=\"nofollow\">monograph for tablets<\/a> we can read (bold is mine):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tablets are solid dosage forms usually obtained by single or multiple compression of powders or granules. In certain cases tablets may be obtained by moulding or extrusion techniques. They are uncoated or coated.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Tablets are normally right circular solid cylinders, the end surfaces of which are flat or convex and the edges of which may be bevelled. <strong>They may have lines or break-marks<\/strong> (scoring), symbols or other markings.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If the break-mark(s) is/are intended to facilitate breaking the tablet for ease of swallowing a dose consisting of one or more whole tablets, the scoring is not critical. However, <strong>if the break-mark(s) is/are intended to permit accurate subdivision of the tablet in order to provide doses of less than one tablet, the scoring is critical. Tablets containing active ingredients having a narrow therapeutic window should generally not be presented with break-marks for subdivision.<\/strong> Non-functional break-marks should be avoided.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The point about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window\" rel=\"nofollow\">therapeutic window<\/a> shows why splitting pills may be dangerous. The therapeutic window is the range of concentration of a drug which treats disease whilst staying within the safety range.<\/p>\n\n<p>If this window is narrow, minimal changes in the dose can cause the treatment to be ineffective -if there is too few of the active ingredient- or toxic -if there is too much.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Pharmacopoeia also lists several tests to be done on tablets. In particular, in the presence of break-marks, the manufacturer should<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ensure the effectiveness of break-marks with respect to the uniformity of mass or content, as appropriate, of the subdivided parts so that the patient receives the intended dose.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A suitable test to assess the uniformity of mass during development is as follows:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Take 30 tablets at random. Break each tablet by hand and take one part for the test and reject the other part(s). Weigh each of the 30 parts thus obtained and calculate the average mass. No individual mass is outside the limits of 75% to 125% and not more than one individual mass is outside the limits of 85% to 115% of the average mass.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I will not go into further details, but there are, for instance, other tests to be done to ensure uniformity of mass and content from tablet to tablet, as well as their physical stability (i.e.: they don't have to fall apart in the box).<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the packaging should generally include instructions about whether it is safe to split the tablet and how to store (and how long) unused pieces.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is for splitting tablets. The opposite situation may also arise. Are 2x2mg tablets equivalent to 1x4mg one (speaking of weigth of the active compound in the tablet, not the weight of the tablet itself)? The same reasonings as above apply, however, because tablets should be uniform and no breaking is involved, this is generally safer than the previous case.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of this applied to a single dose of a drug. Now I would just add a word about repeated doses. I cannot stress this enough: always refer to your physician about drug dosing. Taking a pill in the morning and one in the evening is NOT the same thing as taking two in the morning and none in the evening or taking four halves during the day. Self-dosing <strong>is dangerous and should never be done<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taking half the dose may result in sub-optimal concentration of the drug (so it won't work as expected). Taking twice the dose may result in a toxic peak concentration, which is obviously not something that you want.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>* note that there are multiple Pharmacopoeias, and the exact directives may vary.

DNA is constantly \"read\", what this means is that genes are transcribed to RNA which in turn is translated into proteins. To use a horrible simplification, genes are the blueprints for proteins.

So, if the gene you change is one that will be read again during the cell's lifetime, then you will see a change. A classic example of this is cancer.

If you were able wave a wand over the head of someone with blonde hair, replacing all their DNA with a different version of the gene, say, the one for brown hair, then chances are that as their hair grows, you would see that it was now brown at the roots! Something like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gy3dvm.jpg\" alt=\"Dyed hair colour change\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this picture is evidence of hair dye, not my magic wand. ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>Every time the cells try to produce a pigment, they read that particular gene. But now, they find the \"brown version\", and produce a brown pigment instead of a blonde one.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you replace the gene affecting the length of a person's fingers, they may not just sprout a couple of extra centimetres over the next few months. Those genes may only be read at a particular time of life, such as during puberty or as a child, so they have to be in place at that moment to have much of an effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, that idea of replacing all the copies of your DNA with a different version is roughly called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">gene therapy<\/a>\", and we're still really in the investigation stage of research (to my knowledge).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that helps to solidify your understanding. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>(And just to add yet another note for this, most traits in humans, like finger length and hair colour, are not the result of just one single gene.

All living organisms have the exact same time of evolution as they all derive from a common ancestor. They simply evolved through different paths, that's what explain the biodiversity we can observe today and no organism is better than others, not even human.<\/p>\n\n<p>New functions are not created just like that, because a species need it. To take your cephalopod's example : if there's pressure from predators, they won't simply grow spikes in order to protect themselves. However, if mutations (one or many) appear in the DNA sequence that make spikes instead of, say, skin, then this particular cephalopod will have better chances of surviving than others and so, better chances to reproduce and pass his new genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations do not necessarily imply degradation -just as the los of one function is not necessarily a degradation. Every organs appeared thanks to mutations and / or duplications. For example, the humans' ability to see colors is due to 3 types of pigments (blue, red, green) named opsine S (blue), opsine M (green), opsine L (red). You add rhodopsine which is sensible to light to see clearly. If you study a mouse's eye, you'll only find 2 opsines + rhodophsine. Scientists have been able to recreate evolution's story : you start with an ancestral gene for opsine. The gene is duplicated and the copy is translocated on another chromosome. You now have 2 copies of the gene on 2 different chromosomes. They both mutate as mutations occur all of the time. You end up with 2 new genes. Then, duplication will happen again (no particular reason). You now have 4 genes, identical two by two. Three genes stay where they are, one of them is translocated on another chromosome and they'll all mutate. You finally get 4 genes on 3 different chromosomes (opsine M, L, S and rhodopsine). New genes and new ability appeared thanks to mutation, duplication and translocation. It just took millions of years of evolution and probably an impressive amount of tests. <\/p>\n\n<p>As Shigeta wrote, everything potentially exists. Some of the possibilities have been discovered, some have not. Evolution applies on hundreds millions of years and billions of living organisms and it process accidents after accidents.

First of all, there is no such thing as \"correct\" or \"error\", there are only changes, some of them are better for the individual and some are worse. You also have a basic misunderstanding of the concept of information. An error does not decrease the amount of information, it just alters that information. For example, consider this sentence:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The book is read<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Say, I make a simple error when I transcribe it:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The book is red<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The two statements contain the same amount of information. Nothing has been lost, only changed. <strong>But that change created new information<\/strong>. Now what if a try a different change:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The book is rled<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, this one is nonsensical, indeed, but how does that translate into DNA?<\/p>\n\n<p>The computer analogy is a bad one. Programming languages have a very specific set of rules and anything outside those rules results in a error. For example, while this is a perfectly valid statement in many scripting languages:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>print \"Hello World\"\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This one is not:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>priint \"Hello World\"\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>That, however, is not the way that DNA works. DNA is read in words of three characters, the codons. Every single possible \ncombination of those characters actually has a meaning. Therefore, a mutation like that above which would decrease the information content of the sentence (here, the gene) is not possible. Lets quantify. The DNA sequence consists of a long series of chemicals, commonly known as A, C, T and G. Since these are read in \"words\" of three \"letters\", this means you have:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$4^{3} = 64$$<\/p>\n\n<p>64 possible combinations. Of these 64, 61 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_Codon_Table\">are words with a specific meaning<\/a> and 3, the STOP codons, are punctuation marks, full stops if you will. In other words, <strong>all possible combinations of letters have meaning in DNA<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because all possible 3-letter combinations have meaning, no change will affect the information content of the \"sentence\". All it can do is change it. Now, changing the information can indeed result in \"sentences\" that make no sense. In the DNA world, this most often results in what are known as deleterious mutations. These happen all the time, but the result is usually a dead individual. Those with such mutations are not even born (speaking of mammals).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, other mutations, such as the change from <code>read<\/code> to <code>red<\/code> that I mentioned before, can give rise to a change of meaning, this change, if it turns out that it makes the individual carrying it more likely to reproduce, will spread across the population and will be <em>selected for<\/em>. That is how new traits can arise.<\/p>\n\n<p>In closing, another point that you have misunderstood is that evolution is not a path from the least to the most complex. In many ways it is the inverse. In fact, by any measure that counts, bacteria are <em>far<\/em> more \"evolved\" than humans for the very simple reason that the only way you can measure evolution is in terms of numbers of generations. Think of evolution as happening every time a species reproduces, this means that bacteria have had orders of magnitude more time to evolve than mammals have. Still, this is a useless comparison which is why nobody compares species by how \"evolved\" they are.

Without predatory pressure this is next to useless: the cephalopod are investing energy on something which brings no benefit. So they are less fit and will probably have fewer offspring than the original ones. Now a predator kill many soft-skinned cephalopods but sometimes fails to eat their harder skinned brethren. The hard-skin variant will producre more offspring and theier genes spread. Then the next round happens: cephalopods with the hard skin might have another mutation which hardens the shell even more - or the predators might get better teeth.\nBut be aware that this most not happen: maybe no variant with harder skin exists or the genetic error is not present at the time and the whole race simply dies - this happens a lot. Look at dinosaurs or the polar bear (is under pressure because the polar ice melts) etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some fun fact: since each step is random and has a low probabillity, you willl never get the same reult twice.

First, take a step back from the definitions of \"cancer\" versus \"normal\" cell and recognize that cells and tissues can undergo a variety of changes in their growth.  A solid cancer/tumor (as its usually defined) is something that grows and invades the surrounding tissue.   A spectrum of possible cell growth can be :<\/p>\n\n<p>normal -> hypertrophy -> hyperplasia or dysplasia -> hamartoma -> benign tumor -> carcinoma in situ -> invasive cancer -> metastais<\/p>\n\n<p>(this list is <strong>NOT<\/strong> suggesting these are the actual steps to cancer, but instead they are useful for the next paragraph): <\/p>\n\n<p>The point of this list is that from a <em>human<\/em> perspective <strong>we<\/strong> can see something odd happening when we see a tumor, but the view from inside a cancer cell is basically \"things are fine, I'm just doing my cell thing\".  <\/p>\n\n<p>But, that said...when a tumor grows and cancer cells invade tissues a few things happen which can give rise to differences between cancer cells and normal tissues and which can be detected.<br>\nFirst, it needs energy, and cancer cells often switch to aerobic glycolysis (a phenomenon called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_effect#Oncology\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warburg effect<\/a>). As the link shows, a special form of labelled glucose can be used to detect this in the body.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a tumor invades the surrounding tissue and generates new blood vessels, and so enzymes that break down <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteases_in_angiogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">extracellular matrix <\/a> are released.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Some tumors over-express and secrete markers (usually proteins) that can be detected.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">prostate specific antigen<\/a> (PSA) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">carcinoembryonic antigen<\/a> are two examples.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Other things secreted by certain tumors may <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_cancer_detection\" rel=\"nofollow\">include volatiles that can be detected by dogs<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The challenge with any 'signature' detection is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity\" rel=\"nofollow\">sensitivity and specificity <\/a> which often limits the use of tests that show some early promise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cancer cells <strong>DO<\/strong> have specific changes to their <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/cancergenomics/AllPages\" rel=\"nofollow\">DNA<\/a> that can be used as very specific signatures for detection.

Doing so, just count the proportion of offsprings that measure 11 inches. You can reason slightly more logically and get a faster answer. To measure 11 inches you need to have only capital letters in your genome except at one position. In consequence, if your father gives the gamete $ABC$, you mother should give the gamete $ABc$, $AbC$ or $aBC$. You can inverse the role of the father and the mother and it works as well. Therefore, you have 6 possible combinations that give rise to an offspring that measure 11 inches.

First, though, you need to understand that cancer is a very complex disease, and cancer is not caused by a single mutation alone. The \"multiple-hit\" or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudson_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knudson hypothesis<\/a> essentially states that a cell <strong>progresses<\/strong> from a normal cell to a cancerous one, accumulating multiple mutations along the way. In pretty much all cases, at least two specific mutations are needed - the constitutive activation of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-oncogene\" rel=\"nofollow\">proto-oncogene<\/a>, a group of proteins responsible for cell growth and proliferation, and the deletion or inactivation of one or more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumor suppressor genes<\/a>, which are used to keep growth and proliferation under control. This way, you have a tumor driver (often this is a single protein, like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">growth factor receptor<\/a>) \"driving\" the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">oncogenic process<\/a>, with no \"brake\" or regulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I said, mutations in tumor suppressor genes generally result in loss-of-function changes, or complete deletion/inactivation of the gene altogether, so \"isolating\" these proteins in the cell wouldn't do much good. The focus of many tumor therapies is to down-regulate, inhibit, destroy, or otherwise remove the function of the protein that is driving the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cells, forming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumors<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis\" rel=\"nofollow\">metastases<\/a>. If we're lucky, the tumor driver is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">extracellular domain<\/a>-containing protein (like a cell-surface receptor) that can be identified and targeted from outside the cell. Once this has occurred, scientists and doctors can use specially-derived <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">monoclonal antibodies<\/a> to target and kill the cells containing these proteins:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Monoclonal_antibodies.svg/700px-Monoclonal_antibodies.svg.png\" alt=\"therapeutic monoclonal antibodies\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Monoclonal antibodies for cancer.<\/strong> ADEPT, antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy; ADCC, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; CDC, complement dependent cytotoxicity; MAb, monoclonal antibody; scFv, single-chain variable fragment.<\/sub> <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>From <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3aMonoclonal_antibodies.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">WikiMedia Commons<\/a>, released into the public domain.<\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways the cancer cells can be killed, from delivery of radiation or other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity\" rel=\"nofollow\">cytotoxic<\/a> compounds, to attracting killer cells from the immune system, to activating the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">complement system<\/a>. However, all of these depend on the surface presence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker\" rel=\"nofollow\">biomarkers<\/a> for the cancerous cells, so as to avoid non-specific killing or off-target effects.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason so much focus is put on killing the cancerous cells instead of trying to isolate the \"bad guys\" inside the cells is that by the time the cell has become cancerous, it already has accumulated so many mutations that <strong><em>a<\/em><\/strong>) the cell isn't really worth saving, and <strong><em>b<\/em><\/strong>) it would take an extraordinary amount of effort to corral all the mutated proteins together, and leave whatever unaffected or \"wild-type\" proteins were left to do their jobs. <\/p>\n\n<p>You may recall that each gene we have (except for some on the X and Y chromosomes) is present in duplicate, one copy from our mother and one from our father. The initial mutations that begin the progression to the fully cancerous state may at first only affect one of those two copies of the gene, leaving a working version around for a while. However, as oncogenesis progresses, and more and more regulatory proteins are inactivated, chromosomal damage grows, and frequently the surviving \"normal\" copy is either mutated itself or completely destroyed. Once this occurs, even if you could isolate the misbehaving proteins, there would be no good proteins left to do the jobs of the cell. Therefore, killing is really the only option.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope I've covered what you were interested in.

However, the therapy needs full adherence (missing a dose can already cause viral loads to rise) and is lifelong. The reason for this is because HIV integrates into the genome of host CD4+ T cells, of which there are latent populations in places difficult to reach with therapeutics such as peripheral lymph nodes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently, some rare individuals actually achieve a \"functional cure\", i.e. the body is able to suppress viral replication for a given period of time (5 years) without ART. But these patients \"are characterised by a favourable HLA profile and potent HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses that are associated with a low viral DNA reservoir\" (Katlama et al). They also mention another group of five patients who did not seem to have a favourable genetic profile and were still able to control HIV following cessation of ART for several years (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0b013e32833b61ba\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0b013e32833b61ba<\/a> Hocqueloux, 2010: Long-term immunovirologic control following antiretroviral therapy interruption in patients treated at the time of primary HIV-1 infection).

In one, he put a thick block of wax into the hive. \u2018The bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it: and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work at such a distance from each other, that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells.\u2019 (Origin, p. 223.) The cells were built up in a hexagonal shape when their bases intersected with those of other cells; but the pyramidal bases were apparently not built, since there was no pressure to accommodate cells on the other side of the wax, which was a thick block.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to have a built in burrowing behavior in how the lattice forms that eventually turns into hexagonal shapes. <\/p>\n\n<p>BTW this topic is very similar to the <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3881292?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103845260603\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolution of spider webs<\/a>, which is also fascinating. <\/p>\n","answer_id":16052,"question_id":16051,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1395704968},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bffd6b037fec5dba6e41dfd5c6b538d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6137,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6137/displayname","reputation":267,"display_name":"DisplayName"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1395824489,"creation_date":1395824103,"body":"<p>I remember an episode of a German science show talking about this.

If your bubbles are of uniform size, you will notice that the cells form hexagons and start to look much like the cells of a beehive.

Efficiency dictates that you build your \"hive\" or nest as compact as possible. That means spherical shape which has the most volume vs surface ratio and the hexagons inside follow the same rule.

The CDC uses examples like Nipah virus and hantavirus.<\/p>\n\n<p>So that's the list of what the CDC thinks is a big deal. You'll note influenza isn't even on there. I'd argue that any given novel influenza strain belongs in Class C, and likely not Class A because, while potentially both transmissible and virulent, a known vaccine exists and simply needs to be formulated.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of properties for an organism, I'd suggest the following, in no particular order (it likely depends on what said organism is meant to do):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highly virulent: The disease needs to be able to cause human disease, with high rates of both morbidity and mortality.<\/li>\n<li>Highly transmissible: Unless the goal is to cause a \"one off\" incident, the disease needs to be able to establish a productive chain of human-to-human infections. Humans can't be a dead-end host. Ideally, this needs to be direct human to human transmission, rather than a vector born disease like West Nile.<\/li>\n<li>Stable and amenable to engineering. It needs to be something that's easy to culture and grow in large numbers. This one often gets overlooked somewhat, but despite the fact that its now somewhat commonplace, bioengineering isn't exactly easy.<\/li>\n<li>Not amenable to treatment.

These are unlikely to get to 6-8% of the cases which @Masi writes, but I am missing the reference here.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first possibility are people with chronic renal failure. They have problems with their immune responses since their antigenpresenting cells do not get the necessary co-stimulatory signal by the T-cells. See this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10195626\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper<\/a>. People with other problems in their T-cells or the co-stimulatory signal would have this problem, too. See this <a href=\"http://www.jci.org/articles/view/113129\" rel=\"nofollow\">article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other possibility would be the distribution of the antibodies. The diphteria toxin is made out of two subunits, A and B. B is important for making the way of A into the cell, A gets cleaved in this process and fully active. When the antibodies made in the process are mostly against A (and then against parts, which change their conformation after the cleavage), this antibodies are mostly useless to fight the toxin.

Of those 609 who had previously been vaccinated, only 10 (or 1.6%) developed measles. Of the 16 children who were not immunized, 7 (or 44%) developed measles. Thus, the risk for immunized children was less than 2% while the risk for unimmunized children was 44%.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most vaccine development struggles to reach high immune efficacy; You usually can't just inject some dead bacteria or virus and expect to get an immune response.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In particular I think there has been adaptations in the immune system to DT such that it tends to stimulate an immune response.  This is pretty much a reaction to the peptide sequence itself.  We know this because since the 1980s there has been concern that the live toxins in DPT vaccines might be causing health problems with young children.  (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/dtap/dtapindex.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">They don't<\/a>).  As such, acellular vaccines were developed where just a few proteins were included - the cell was not used, and DT was produced where only a fragment was added or the toxin was rendered inactive by mutagenesis. DT is such a reliable component that by itself <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X9900568X\" rel=\"nofollow\">it can illicit an 88% immunity rate<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>These DT fragments are formulated with other bacterial components to <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/86/4/617.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">create new vaccines<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The failure of the vaccine on occasion is most likely the result of individual variations in immune loci. The immune system is highly complex and also highly variable from individual to individual even amongst close relatives.  their immune activation or their defenses (complement and immunoglobin pathways) may make some individuals more susceptible to diphtheria than others. <\/p>\n\n<p>The science of vaccine formulation is highly empirical; I don't think it is understood why some molecules evoke a broadly distributed reaction and others do not.  Even so the diphtheria toxin is one of the more universal immune stimulants known.

Ion concentrations are:<\/p>\n\n<p>internal Na<sup>+<\/sup>  = 12 mM;\nexternal Na<sup>+<\/sup> = 140 mM;\ninternal K<sup>+<\/sup>   = 140 mM;\nexternal K<sup>+<\/sup>   = 5 mM;\nand membrane potential = -60 mV (negative inside the cell)<\/p>\n\n<p>I use these values for constants:<\/p>\n\n<p>gas constant R = 2 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup> K<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Faraday constant F= 23,062 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup> V<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>and I\u2019ll assume that the temperature, T, is 37‚ÑÉ = 310 K<\/p>\n\n<p>The Na<sup>+<\/sup>/K<sup>+<\/sup> pump uses 1 molecule of ATP to move 3 Na<sup>+<\/sup> out of the cell and 2 K<sup>+<\/sup> into the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>The efficiency of the pump is therefore energy required to move these ions/energy released by ATP hydrolysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>How much energy is needed to move the ions? In each case there is a contribution from the fact that the ions are moved along a concentration gradient (the chemical component) and from the movement along a gradient of electrical potential (because of the membrane potential). In considering these components we have to think about whether energy needs to be used when the ions move, or whether it is released.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the chemical component we can use<\/p>\n\n<p>ŒîG = RTln(ratio of concentration, inside and outside), where ln = natural logarithm<\/p>\n\n<p>The sign of this ŒîG will depend upon how the ratio is expressed (in/out or out/in) but the absolute value will be the same. So I calculate an absolute value and then deduce the sign of the free energy change.<\/p>\n\n<p>For Na<sup>+<\/sup> ŒîG = modulus(2 x 310 x ln(12/140)) = 1,523 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Since Na<sup>+<\/sup> is being moved up a concentration gradient, work must be done so the free energy change is positive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Applying the same formula and logic for the movement of K<sup>+<\/sup>:<\/p>\n\n<p>ŒîG = 2,065 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n<p>(This value is greater than that for Na<sup>+<\/sup> because the concentration gradient is steeper.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Next I calculate the electrical components using:<\/p>\n\n<p>ŒîG = zFŒº, where z is the charge on the ion = 1 in both cases, and Œº is the membrane potential (in volts).<\/p>\n\n<p>So for both Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> the absolute ŒîG value is 1,383 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, in this case Na<sup>+<\/sup> is moving out, against the membrane potential while K<sup>+<\/sup>  is moving in with the membrane potential. Thus the value of ŒîG is positive for Na<sup>+<\/sup> but negative for K<sup>+<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now I combine the chemical and electrical components to get the net free energy change per mole of ions moved:<\/p>\n\n<p>Na<sup>+<\/sup> ŒîG = 1,523 + 1,383 = 2,906 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>K<sup>+<\/sup> ŒîG = 2,065 -1,383 = 682 cal mol<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Now I consider how to combine these two values. Each cycle of the pump uses 1 ATP to move 3 Na<sup>+<\/sup> and 2 K<sup>+<\/sup>. Therefore each mole of ATP moves 3 moles of Na<sup>+<\/sup> and 2 moles of K<sup>+<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Energy from 1 mole ATP that is used to move ions = (3 x 2,906) + (2 x 682)<\/p>\n\n<p>= 10,082 cal <\/p>\n\n<p>= 10.1 kcal<\/p>\n\n<p>How much energy is released from hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP? Estimates vary but a commonly accepted value seems to be 12 kcal mol<sup>-1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Thus efficiency of the pump = 100*(10.1/12) = 84%.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the free energy of ATP hydrolysis depends on ATP concentration, pH, and the amount of Mg present. For a well-fed brain, this is around 14 kcal/mol (see Journal Of Physical Chemistry B, 114 (49), (2010). 16137-16146).
