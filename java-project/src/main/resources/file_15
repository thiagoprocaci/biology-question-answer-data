The difference is the fact that the <strong>rheobase<\/strong> is an example of a <strong>threshold<\/strong> measure. The <strong>threshold<\/strong>, as you correctly suggest, is the minimal energy (typically current level and not voltage as you suggest) to excite neural tissue. The threshold applies only under the specific experimental parameter settings used. These parameters include the type of electric stimulus (for example, a biphasic current pulse), the electrode configuration (for example, bipolar stimulation) and the stimulus duration (for example 200 microseconds).<\/p>\n\n<p>The rheobase is the minimal current level needed to excite a tissue when an <strong>infinitely long stimulus would be applied<\/strong>. The rheobase is typically found by plotting the threshold level (as defined above) as a function of stimulus duration. The reason for developing this measure is the fact that excitable membranes integrate the injected current, so charge builds up in the tissue. In other words, increasing the pulse duration decreases the threshold current level needed. Hence, the rheobase is a convenient threshold measure because it incorporates the duration parameter of the stimulus. It will still depend on things like electrode configuration and stimulus shape.<\/p>\n\n<p>The function of the strength-duration relationship can be fitted with a decaying exponential: <\/p>\n\n<p>I = I<sub>th<\/sub> / ( 1-e<sup>(-t/Tsd)<\/sup> )<\/p>\n\n<p>where I= Threshold current level; \nI<sub>rh<\/sub> = rheobase\nt = stimulus duration\nTsd = Tau = exponential<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture of a theoretical strength-duration curve copied from the wiki page on rheobase.

First of all, a more nutritious environment during development can lead to increased height, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-we-getting-taller/\">this is one reason why more recent generations appear to be taller.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Height is also an example of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics\">quantitative trait<\/a> - this means many genes (or loci [singular is locus], locations in the DNA) affect the phenotype (the physical measurable result i.e. a persons height). It is infact how the vast majority of traits are determined. At each locus that affects height there may be polymorphism (when more than one allele, or variant of that gene, exists).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose height entirely is determined by 2 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_genetic_effects\">additive<\/a> loci, $A$ and $B$, and no environmental effect occurs, and there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy\">diploidy<\/a> (two of each locus, one from each parent, determines height in a person). <\/p>\n\n<p>Each locus has two alleles denoted by $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1 $ and $B_2$. Each copy of alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ add 40 cm to a persons height, $A_2$ and $B_2$ add 50 cm to a persons height. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now a man who is $A_1 A_1, B_1 B_2$ (remember, humans are diploid) and a woman who is $A_2 A_1, B_1 B_1$ have children. Both parents are 170 cm tall. The theoretical limits for the population would be 160 cm and 200 cm. The children will inherit one copy of $A_1$ from the father and $B_1$ from the mother, but they could inherit either $B_1$ or $B_2$ from the father and either $A_1$ or $A_2$ from the mother. If a child inherited both of the taller alleles then they would be taller than the parents ($A_1 A_2, B_1 B_2$ = 180 cm). Likewise some offspring could be shorter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course the reality is much more complex; height is determined by many more than 2 loci, by the environment, and gene * environment interactions. This principle was a hugely important because it meant that reproduction did not necessarily remove variation from the gene pool (a fundamental problem with early evolutionary theory was the thought of \"blending\" - when offspring are the average of their parents)<\/p>\n","answer_id":23142,"question_id":23110,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1413386104},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456001863,"creation_date":1439370864,"body":"<p>Yes, people can definitely grow taller than their parents.

For simplicity, it is often said that 90% of children will fall within 10cm of the sex-adjusted mid-parental height. However, the deviations are smaller if the parents are unusually short or tall, representing \"regression to the mean\", and parental height is a poorer predictor for offspring height in these cases. Using the midparent mean as a predictor of offspring height is otherwise standard practice, as can be seen in online applications (e.g. <a href=\"http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://medcalc3000.com/HeightPotential.htm<\/a>).

However, there are few studies on the effect of the intensity of inbreeding and different degrees of inbreeding on mortality and morbidity. The present study is an attempt to examine the effects of inbreeding on mortality and morbidity including congenital disorders in different levels of inbreeding among Telugu-speaking populations of Kharagpur, West Bengal, India, based on data collected through extensive pedigrees. The study reveals that the frequency of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths is higher in the offspring of consanguineous marriages than in that of non-consanguineous marriages. A similar effect is also observed in the infant mortality rate, which is known to have a genetic component, but is not seen in the mortality rate of children and juveniles. The rate of morbidity is consistently higher in the offspring of consanguineous marriages with a sex bias in favour of inbred females. The increased morbidity rates in inbred individuals tend to be inversely correlated with the increase in average autosomal inbreeding coefficient. This appears to strengthen Sanghvi's hypothesis of a decline in the frequency of deleterious genes with intensification of inbreeding through generations. The present study also confirms an increase in genetic disorders with an increase in inbreeding in almost all populations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sources &amp; Further Reading:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41465109?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jstor.org/stable/41465109?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.popline.org/node/184635\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.popline.org/node/184635<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2080450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2080450/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1398609\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1398609<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Exogamy_and_endogamy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Exogamy_and_endogamy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":43487,"question_id":43485,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1455960423,"creation_date":1455958848,"body":"<p><strong>Populations founded by a single pair are quite common in the lab<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7384/full/nature10811.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Drosophila<\/em> Genetic Reference Panel<\/a>, one such example of high artificial inbreeding, is a series of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbred_strain\" rel=\"nofollow\">inbred lines<\/a> where the researchers mated brother and sister flies for 20 generations to form the lines, which means they <a href=\"http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/genetics/inbreeding.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">will be <em>highly<\/em> inbred<\/a>. When you do these though you often lose many of the initial lines because of inbreeding depression. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_depression\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inbreeding depression<\/a> is reduced fitness as a result of increased homozygosity in the lines - deleterious mutations are more frequently expressed. I have tried to find the number of initial pairs they used to make the ~200 DGRP lines but come up unsuccessful, but I've heard it was around 1500 pairs, although that may be well off the mark<sup>*<\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What would happen to your mice?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Just like the DGRP lines, there is a high risk that the population would collapse. However, if they do get through a few generations of inbreeding, and are kept in steady conditions (i.e. selection doesn't change once the lines are formed), then they have an ok chance of persisting. If you started with multiple founder pairs then there's a better chance you will still have some (very inbred) mice in a few generations. The success rate will depend on the frequency of deleterious mutations and strength of their effects.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is inbreeding?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Inbreeding is increased homozygosity in the population than would be expected under random mating. For example, if the frequency of two alleles ($A_1$ and $A_2$) at a gene are $p = 0.1$ and $q = 0.9$ respectively, the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/hardy-weinberg-equilibrium-122\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected frequency<\/a> of $A_1A_1$ homozygotes is <\/p>\n\n<p>$p^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01$ <\/p>\n\n<p>the expected frequency of $A_2A_2$ homozygotes is <\/p>\n\n<p>$q^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$ <\/p>\n\n<p>and the expected frequency of heterozygotes is<\/p>\n\n<p>$A_1A_2$ is $2pq = 2 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.9 = 0.18$<\/p>\n\n<p>If the true frequency of <em>heterozygotes<\/em> ($A_1A_2$) is less than 0.18, then there is inbreeding.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a benefit to inbreeding?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Well inbreeding <em>can<\/em> be a good thing. Imagine all of those lines that did not collapse. It is possible that a population formed out of those would have higher fitness than the original population, because deleterious mutations may have been purged (lines carrying deleterious mutations are more likely to collapse). So a highly inbred population <em>can<\/em> prosper. However, that population would also have lower genetic variance. <a href=\"http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.se/2011/01/fishers-fundamental-theorem-on-natural.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genetic variance places limits on the potential for adaptation<\/a>, low genetic variance means low potential to respond to selection. So, if selection is not constant, then inbred populations are more likely to go extinct as they are unable to adapt to novel scenarios.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inbreeding in nature<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One classical example of high inbreeding in nature is in cheetahs, where it is beleived they went through a strong genetic bottleneck ~10,000 years ago.

It may, however, not be the photons that activate the neurons <em>per se<\/em>, but the resulting temperature changes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nIn contrast to the comments and original answer, it is possible to activate neurons, other than photoreceptors, with light.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Infrared laser light<\/strong> (~2000 nm) has been demonstrated to activate neurons in the periphery, including neurons in the <em>sciatic<\/em> and <em>facial nerves<\/em> and the <em>spiral ganglion cells<\/em> in the cochlea <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541079/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Thompson <em>et al<\/em>., 2014)<\/a>. Interestingly, <strong>green laser light<\/strong> in the <strong>visible spectrum<\/strong> (532 nm) has also been shown to activate neurons <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725719\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Wenzel <em>et al<\/em>., 2009)<\/a>. In the brain, laser light has been shown to activate neurons, including the <em>primary visual cortex<\/em> and <em>somatosensory cortex<\/em>. Typically, short (intermittent) bursts of stimulation are used, with exposure times in the millisecond range <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541079/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Thompson <em>et al<\/em>., 2014)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The underlying mechanism of laser-activation of neurons is debated. The current evidence points to the possibility that focal illumination of neurons with light may <strong>increase the temperature<\/strong> of the cell, which may result in changes in <strong>membrane capacitance<\/strong>. Changes in membrane capacitance can cause voltage differences. Hence, lasers may induce action potentials by causing heat-induced depolarizations. Further, it is thought that temperature changes affects transmembrane ion channels and <strong>TRPV channels<\/strong> that in turn play a modulatory role in the laser-induced activation of neurons. TRPV channels, for example, include the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1\" rel=\"nofollow\">heat-sensing TRPV1 receptor<\/a><\/strong>, that is thought to be activated by laser light-induced temperature changes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541079/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Thompson <em>et al<\/em>., 2014)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why the fuzz about laser-induced neuron activation? <strong>Cochlear and retinal implants<\/strong> restore limited auditory and visual function in the deaf and blind, respectively. In both techniques, electrodes are used to activate spiral ganglion cells (in the inner ear) retinal ganglion cells (in the eye). Electric currents have the tendency to spread laterally through the tissue, preventing focused activation of specific localized regions of the cochlea and retina, respectively. Hence, both approaches suffer from <em>channel-channel interactions<\/em>, leading to crude stimulation profiles and reduced frequency resolution (cochlear implants) and low spatial-resolution (in case of retinal implants). Lasers, on the other hand, can be made into <strong>nearly infinitesimally small rays<\/strong> that have <strong>minimal scatter<\/strong> compared to electric current spread. Hence, laser-induced activation may be useful for specifically stimulating small populations of neurons in a certain tissue, opening up great possibilities in <strong>neural-prosthetics<\/strong>, such as auditory and visual prosthetics <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986005/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Rettenmeijer, 2014)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>References<br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541079/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thompson <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Curr Mol Imaging<\/em> (2014); <strong>3<\/strong>(2): 162\u201377<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986005/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rettenmeijer, <em>Biomed Opt Express<\/em> (2014) <strong>5<\/strong>(4): 1014\u201325<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725719\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wenzel <em>et al<\/em>., <em>J Biomed Opt<\/em> (2009); <strong>14<\/strong>(4): 044007<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":43482,"question_id":13470,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1455964479}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13470/what-will-happen-if-we-expose-the-brain-to-intermittent-light","last_activity_date":1455964479,"creation_date":1384370606,"answer_count":2,"title":"What will happen if we expose the brain to intermittent light?","body":"<p>If a brain is exposed to an intermittent light source, are specific areas going to fire?

It has a lipid bilayer that encloses a potent cocktail of acid hydrolases working at a low pH. The pH is maintained by a Cl<sup>-<\/sup>/H<sup>+<\/sup> antiporter(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22335796\">Ref<\/a>). Acid hydrolases that are being processed in the golgi are targeted to the lysosome through mannose-6-phosphate residues which are recognized by the trans golgi M6P receptors, packaged into clathrin vesicles, and targeted to acidic late endosomes which fuse, forming the lysososome (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9953/\">Ref<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So through endocytosis or phagocytosis, vesicles full of extracellular proteins are uptaken and may fuse with a lysosome. The hydrolases thus digest whatever they can. In a cell stress response cells may also digest their own contents with the aid of lysosomes in a process called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy\">autophagy<\/a>. We can take a look <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684028/table/T1/\">here<\/a> at some established lysosomal enzymes current to 2009, and if you spot a protease you can generally take a look at it's specific mechanism to see how it works. So I'll pick one out of the bunch (a lysosome has many different hydrolases remember), Dipeptidyl-peptidase I aka Cathepsin C. The mechanism of proteolysis is that of a cysteine protease which follows a bit of a generic mechanism like so:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ydeyX.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ydeyX.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>... and so forth, you can look at a given given protease, and roughly determine <em>how<\/em> it cleaves peptides.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome\">proteasome<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This one is a a much more directed form of protein degradation. Proteins must be <em>tagged<\/em> on lysine residues by molecules of ubiquitin, at least 4, referring to the term polyubiquitination. These are added sequentially by proteins denoted E1, E2 and E3 (see proteasome wiki). Proteins that get degraded in this manner are often damaged or come from within the cell, unlike the lysosome where the proteins probably came from outside the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>The catalytic domain of the proteasome is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine_protease#mechanism\">threonine protease<\/a> which follows the generic mechanism of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_triad\">catalytic triad<\/a>, one of the most well-studied protease mechanisms.

In fact, dinosaurs evolved on Pangaea, and their fossils are found on every modern continent.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, imagine a taxon that evolved after Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwanaland. If this taxon evolved in Gondwanaland, then its fossils and descendants will likely occur only on the southern continents.

Mostly used to observe for non-peptide\nmoities and cofactors of the protein like heme in hemoglobin for\ninstance.  <\/li>\n<li>RAMAN spectroscopy - also an IR spectroscopy, but which\ncan look for dynamic qualities of the interatomic vibrations.  Like\nIR this is used with cofactors usually and not the protein, which\nlooks very much the same over most of a peptide.<\/li>\n<li>UV/visible spectroscopy - on the low end, examine the behavior or concentration of chromophores associated with the protein.  used for kinetics - study of enzymes in the act of catalysis.  On the high end can also be used for things like watching photon-energy transduction in photosynthetic systems and things like this. The peptide itself has no Visible absorption, but the colored molecules are often used as a probe to watch the peptide in action - like folding.<br>\nFRET is a technique that can measure how far apart two colored labels are - two separate points of a protein are labelled and a distance measurement obtained. <\/li>\n<li>UV circular dichroism.  the aromatic side chains of Phe, Trp, Tyr, His etc absorb in the UV and are directly observed to follow folding some times.  Circular dichroism looks for differences in the absorption of right and left circularly polarized light and can show secondary structure.  <\/li>\n<li>X-ray.  Scattering of proteins in solution can measure the so called 'radius of gyration' which profiles the overall shape of the protein.  X-ray scattering off of 2D and 3D crystals can reveal the molecular protein structure.  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Others:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Calorimetry.  By tracking the heat capacity/heat given off/taken in by a protein, its folding state, binding and other structural characteristics of a protein sample can be measured. <\/li>\n<li>Mass Spectroscopy - generally this just measures whether a protein is present, by fragmenting it and measuring the mass of the fragments.  useful for mixtures of many proteins (like a living cell).<\/li>\n<li>Peptide sequencing - like Mass Spec, but often used when there is just one protein in a pure sample.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There's lots more - just depends on where you want to cut off the list.

I think this is wrong in ignoring the uncertainty about the estimate of the start of R-R or simplifically the start of AP. \nI think we should be able to estimate the precise location of action potential better. \nThey are using commonly exclusion principles which lose much original signal and decrease sensitivity<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>by excluding small time, frequency $|x|, |\\eta| \\in \\mathbf R$ by choosing the window $w$ such that $w(t) \\approx 0 \\approx \\hat{w}(\\eta)$. <\/li>\n<li>by excluding one beat normal beat before and after each ectopic beat. <\/li>\n<li>system fails if more than 20% of ectopic beats. <\/li>\n<li>system fails in 24h recordings because of computational issues of longer segments - so limiting to 5 minutes and averaging.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>My Exclusions and Hypothesis<\/h2>\n\n<p>To detect the exact beginning of the action potential $s$ value $s(x) \\in \\mathbf R$ at exact instance $x \\in \\mathbf R$ is unpractical. \nInstead, I measure some averages of the signal: $A_{\\sigma} s(x) := \\int_{\\mathbf R} x(y) \\varphi_{0,\\sigma}(y-x) dy$ where $\\varphi_{0,\\sigma}$ is 0-average-valued $\\sigma$-variance of normal density function.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$A_{\\sigma} s(x) := \\int_{\\mathbf R} x(y) \\varphi{0,\\sigma}(y-x) dy$. <\/li>\n<li>No windowing function so including also small time, frequency $|x|, |\\eta| \\in \\mathbf R$. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Processes limiting to detect the beginning of action potential<\/h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Technical processes (fine with these)<\/li>\n<li>HR Saturation process. <\/li>\n<li>HR Recovery process. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I am very interested in how you can characterize HR saturation process and the HR recovery process. \nI think they are using individual signals measure in three circumstances: <em>Paced<\/em>, <em>Exercise<\/em> and <em>Recovery<\/em>, <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~joelsd/signals/classwork/BME314signalscw12a.pdf#page40\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. \n<strong>How can you characterise differences between such circumstances?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h2>Views<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~joelsd/signals/classwork/BME314signalscw12a.pdf#page=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Labview<\/a> (most likely LabVIEW Biomedical Toolkit) or Matlab (which should be fine!)<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ECG, <\/li>\n<li>R-wave detection, <\/li>\n<li>IBI signal (Inter-Beat Interval), <\/li>\n<li>Expanded ECG, <\/li>\n<li><p>HRV spectrum. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I do not understand the reason which component is requiring to use Labview <a href=\"https://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/heart-rate-variability/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and most likely its Biomedical Toolkit in the analysis like in <a href=\"https://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/heart-rate-variability/\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>.

Monogenic traits are relatively rare, but are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">linked to some diseases<\/a>, and occur when a single gene affects the trait; most traits are affected by multiple genes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>X-linked traits are affected by genes (only) situated on the X.<\/strong> If a trait is monogenic, it is very easy to describe it as being, or not being, X-linked. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_linkage\" rel=\"nofollow\">If the gene is on the X, it is X-linked. If it is on the Y, it is Y-linked.<\/a> If it is in the autosomes, it is autosomally linked. If all of the genes affecting a trait are found on the X then that <em>trait<\/em> is X-linked. A gene on the X is X-linked, but <em>I<\/em> would only call a <em>trait<\/em> X-linked if all genes were on the X. If there was a mix of X-linked and autosomal genetic variation I would describe the trait as having some X-linked genes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For polygenic traits it is less likely that the genes would be <em>all<\/em> X-linked<\/strong>, so it is less likely that the <em>trait<\/em> is X-linked. Imagine a trait affected by 10 genes, and those 10 genes are randomly spread across the genome. It is unlikely that all 10 would be on the X. However, if some were on the X, then we could describe the trait as having X-linked variation.

There's only one chromosome duplicated, and it's the smallest one. Women with Down's can have kids just fine, but men tend to be sterile(according to <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/children/tc/down-syndrome-what-happens\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebMD<\/a> at least).<\/p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22089/#_A3064_\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for a full coverage of triploid genetics and why triploids are nearly always sterile. In short: gametes formed during meiosis pair off but there's always one copy of each chromosome that chooses a daughter cell at random. If one daughter cell gets none of the extra copies, you have a haploid gamete and a diploid zygote and everything goes according to plan. If one daughter cell gets all of the copies you have a diploid gamete and you'll have a triploid zygote and everything will be fine-ish, but you'll have another triploid generation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Statistically this happens for 2(1 for females with asymmetric gametes, but let's fudge it a little) of the possible sorting patterns, of which there are 2^n where n is the number of chromosomes. For a triploid human male(bear with me) mating with a diploid female(the best possible combination mathematically) instead of the more typical 200 million viable sperm he would produce about 50 viable sperm(About 2 in 8 million sperm have a chance.). If you account for 23-triploidy that number goes up to about 100, but that's still worse than a millionth of the fertility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other combinations are vastly worse. A human female only has about 2 million eggs lifetime total, so even in the best of circumstances a triploid female has maybe a fifty fifty shot at having a single viable egg in her entire life. The calculation for the probability of a two triploid humans(or any n=23 organism) breeding successfully is left as an exercise for the reader but it's very low indeed.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you were working in some other organism with maybe n=2 chromosomes the numbers would be more forgiving and it might be worth thinking about making Punnet squares. They'd work much like Punnet squares for diploid creatures, but the sides would be a little longer to accommodate the larger number of gamete genotypes, and you'd have to adjust the probability of some of the squares to account for aneuploidy-related fatalities and other weirdness. For instance, with two triploid parents the probability of getting a successful triploid zygote from any random pair of zygotes is something like 1/2^n instead of the 4/2^2n or whatever it is for diploid or quadruploid offspring. This is counterbalanced by aneuploid gametes perhaps dying(or even being slightly less fit).<\/p>\n\n<p>If n=1 the math is more tractable, however(surprisingly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_jumper_ant#Genetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">this exists.<\/a> haplodiploidy complicates triploidy considerations so I'm pretending it doesn't exist). Examples like AAaxAa give strange results(only 1/12 are recessively phenotyped) but AaaxAa produces 1/4 recessive phenotypes and 3/4 dominant ones, just like AaxAa.<\/p>\n\n<p>In sum, I see why triploids are just declared infertile and not dealt with in the fullest, most complex sense.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40970,"question_id":40942,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40942/inheritance-patterns-in-individuals-with-triploidy","last_activity_date":1455781189,"creation_date":1448368128,"answer_count":1,"title":"Inheritance patterns in individuals with triploidy","body":"<p>If you search on the genetics of Down's Syndrome, you'll find plenty of results explaining the genetic mechanisms which can result in triploidy.

As an example of a potentially useful phobia, consider the fear of heights. Now consider two different ancestors: one who was afraid of heights and one who was not.

In evolutionary terms, we would say that natural selection confers an advantage to the phobia-possessing individual(s). <a href=\"http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro02/web3/mwhite.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This<\/a> website in particular has some interesting reading:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Others believe that phobias exist because of evolutionary development to avoid danger in order to improve survival. There are several stimuli that are shared by the most phobic people (heights, insects, crowds, etc.) These phobias, with a couple of exceptions, relate more closely to pre-technological societies. Thus, some scientists, such as Martin Seligman, believe that people are inherently \"prepared\" to fear certain objects. ((5))) In other words, our phobias relate closely to the perils of our ancestors, as through natural selection, those who feared the dangerous stimulus survived while those who didn't, died off. Prepared fears appear to be very easily conditioned. Some scientists, such as LeDoux, believe that preparedness and the ease of conditioning are the result of certain preexisting neurological connections that exist evolutionarily.

Why would those individuals forming the stalk spend energy to help other individuals to reproduce?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Kin selection<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Let's think about us, vertebrates, \"real multicellular\" organisms. The cell that is in your eye is never going to reproduce. Although it is spending all its energy into helping your ovules/spermatozoids to fuse. Why would this cell in the eye make such an effort? The genes in the spermatozoids/ovules are essentially the same as those in the \"eye cell\". Therefore, by helping your spermatozoids/ovules the eye cell is actually contributing into spreading copies of the genes that it is carrying. This is referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">kin selection<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Slime molds and altruism<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, the story is not exactly the same for the slime molds. The cells in the stalk can be quite different from those that are undergoing meiosis. Altruism can exist in a variety of different mechanisms and it would take several books to go over the literature about the evolution of altruism. Without knowing the literature specific to the slime molds reproduction, I just want to notice that the cell in the stalk will die anyway, whether or not it spend energy helping other cells reproducing. There is therefore no fitness cost into construction a stalk. Little population structure (causing higher relatedness within deme than among demes) could be enough to allow this behaviour to evolve.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Just a paper (that I haven't read) on the subject<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~aukema/Hudsonetal02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hudson et al. 2002<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetics of the fruiting body<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, similar genes are being used in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelium_discoideum\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Dictyostelium discoideum<\/em><\/a> (slime mold) to create this fruiting body than what is used in multicellular eukaryotes (<a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref.<\/a>).

The point at which the oscillation starts is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bifurcation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hopf-bifurcation<\/a>. I shall explain this in simple intuitive terms. Lets assume that Protein-<strong>X<\/strong> activates the production of Protein-<strong>Y<\/strong> which in-turn causes inhibition of Protein-<strong>X<\/strong> production. This is a negative feedback loop.<\/p>\n\n<p>X → Y <br>\nY ⊣ X<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Situation-1: No/little delay<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You switch on the production of <strong>X<\/strong>. This leads to rapid production of <strong>Y<\/strong> which will in-turn quickly repress the formation of <strong>X<\/strong>. This would happen so quickly and all that would be observed is a reduction in the steady-state level of <strong>X<\/strong> (compared to an unregulated system). Mathematically, the eigenvalues of the system (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant\" rel=\"nofollow\">jacobian<\/a> matrix- denotes the slope of the function) evaluated at the steady state would be negative and real.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Situation-2: Some delay<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In this case, it will take some time for <strong>Y<\/strong> to accumulate. This will cause <strong>X<\/strong> to shoot up above its final steady state level. This, in-turn, will cause higher production of <strong>Y<\/strong>. Because of higher production of <strong>Y<\/strong>, <strong>X<\/strong> will start getting repressed strongly when <strong>Y<\/strong> gets accumulated and starts acting. This will cause <strong>X<\/strong> to shoot down below the steady-state but the magnitude of this shoot-\"down\", will be less than the first shoot-\"up\". Finally, the system will settle to the steady state. This phenomenon is called damped oscillation. In this case, the eigenvalues of the jacobian are complex with negative real parts.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Situation 3: long delay<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In this case the delay between production of <strong>Y<\/strong> and its action is so high that the system does not damp but sustains its oscillations. The eigenvalues of the jacobian are imaginary. These kind of oscillations are generally sensitive to different factors. <\/p>\n\n<p>More robust forms of oscillations exist, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">limit cycles<\/a>.

In other words it keeps the neuron's battery charged. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/btZT8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/btZT8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine the neuron like a circuit. We can imagine that the electro-chemical gradient for each ion species (Potassium, Sodium, and so on) as batteries. So When the ions flow according to their electrochemical gradient, the potassium current flows outward and sodium  current flows inward as dictated by these batteries reversal potentials [negative for potassium, positive for sodium]. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, note that this will discharge those batteries, i.e. the concentration of sodium on the outside of the cell will drop (slightly) as sodium flows inward the cell, and potassium flows outward the concentration on the inside will drop slightly. Thus the magnitude of the reversal potential of the Sodium and Potassium drops (they move closer to zero). <\/p>\n\n<p>To counteract this discharge the Sodium/Potassium pumps expends energy in the form of ATP in order to recharge the batteries. The amount of current that the pumps moves is very small relative to the larger currents of sodium rushing in and the potassium rushing out during an Action Potential. Thus when a neuron fires there is very little overall current contribution from the pumps. <\/p>\n\n<p>When the neuron is at rest (not firing) then the Sodium/Potassium pump is able to recharge the membrane and the current becomes important. Still this is a very slow process, relative to action potentials.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to note, even though the cell is at rest the batteries are discharging slightly. Their is a leakiness to the membrane, sodium leaks in and potassium leaks out. Thus the pump's current will counteract these leaky currents at rest, keeping the batteries charged and thus the overall net current  across the membrane at rest will be zero.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Remember though, these currents are very small currents. <\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Based on Discussion with @Christiaan, I decided to post a update to clarify.<\/p>\n\n<p>At rest potential Sodium Ion influx is much smaller than potassium ion efflux and thus can be ignored. Whether or not Sodium is ignored the above still holds true. The neuron's membrane is at rest which means the net current is equal to zero. This means that the outward potassium current is counterbalanced by the pump's current thus keeping the relative concentrations of Potassium and Sodium constant while at rest and maintaining a steady rest potential.  <\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: Clarifying as per OP comment:<\/p>\n\n<p>So during an action potential Sodium and Potassium ions move in large currents and this current flow discharges the batteries. At rest there is still current flowing (thus smaller discharging of the battery) but there is no <em>Net<\/em> current flow thus no change in voltage(thus the neuron is at rest). It is exactly counterbalanced by the sodium/potassium pumps. The reasons the pump doesn't overcharge the batteries is the constant but smaller discharge at rest. When the recharging current is equal and opposite to the discharge via the leak current, a equilibrium is reached.<\/p>\n\n<p>However when lots of action potentials fire, the resting potential will be altered from the larger discharge rate, thus when the neuron returns to its new resting potential the leak current and pump current will not be balanced, thus the recharging pump current will be larger in magnitude and will bring resting potential back to its normal value.  (Note what constitutes large is relative between species and even neurons.) <\/p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: Rates of Leakiness and Pump activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>If only you could say one is stronger than the other. It depends on the conditions of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lets focus in on potassium. The leak current for potassium is dependent on two (really three) things. The permeability (or conductance) to the membrane to potassium, and the reversal potential of potassium (which is dependant on the internal and external Concentration of Potassium. Thus varying these things will strengthen/weaken the power of the leak current. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Sodium Potassium Pump is dependent on three things. The External Concentration of Potassium, The internal concentration of Sodium and the availability of energy (in the form of ATP). <\/p>\n\n<p>The point where these two strengths are about the same is when there is more Potassium on the inside of the cell. That is to say pump is capable of keeping up with the leakiness of the membrane until the internal concentration of potassium reaches about $140$ $mM$ (again that just a ballpark number). If their is less Potassium in the cell then $140$ $mM$ the pump is stronger, if there is more than $140$ $mM$ the leak of potassium is stronger.     <\/p>\n","answer_id":43379,"question_id":43356,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1455631872},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f59f7acf0f314aa32ca7c03950e9e6f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":587,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/587/chelonian","reputation":253,"display_name":"Chelonian"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe9d73857dd62fae8a55e9430c55a75f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19507,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19507/aleksandrh","reputation":422,"display_name":"AleksandrH","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":43408,"edited":false,"creation_date":1455718569,"comment_id":75188,"body":"Sorry for the late response.

You're resetting it. In the same way, the pumps are there to (continually) reset the imbalance of ions--that is, to make sure there <em>is<\/em> an imbalance (instead of an equal amount of all types of ions on both sides of the membrane). The neuron needs to have this imbalance of ions so that it is like a set mousetrap, ready to fire an action potential when the Na+ channels are \"sprung\".<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and why doesn't it cancel out the resting potential if it moves K+\n  back inside and Na+ back outside?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The potential is due to the difference in number of charges on the inside edge of the neuron's membrane relative to the outside edge of the neuron's membrane, and not due to the small movements of the K+ leak current and the much smaller Na+ leak current. That difference is set up by the pumps, so the order of events is:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The pumps set up (and maintain) the ionic concentration differences.<\/li>\n<li>That causes a voltage difference (think of it as \"electrical pressure\").<\/li>\n<li>That voltage drives the leak current, mostly through open K+ channels.<\/li>\n<li>The pumps run continually reset the small K+ concentration rundown due to the leak current as well as the small Na+ buildup after action potentials.<\/li>\n<li>This always-on nature of the pumps uses up a good amount of ATP, thus the brain has a blood glucose demand to manufacture more ATP for these pumps (among other needs).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Please see <a href=\"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~wjh/neurotut/mempot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page<\/a>, and click on #9, \"Na-K Exchange pump\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Note, when I say \"small\", I mean it. Even in a \"dramatic\" action potential, the % gain in Na+ concentration inside the cell is <a href=\"http://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/neuronal_action_potential/neuronal_action_potential_na_and_k_concentrations_do_not_change_during_an_action_potential.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">only about 0.06%<\/a>. This is because, when it comes to voltage change, only a small amount of ions can result in a big change in voltage.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isn't the voltage fluctuating because of this back and forth movement\n  of K+ out, K+ back in, Na+ in, Na+ back out, etc.? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>At rest, the voltage is <em>not<\/em> fluctuating: it holds steady. And the movement of ions, in net, is not a back-and-forth movement during rest; it's a steady stream. To illustrate this...<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine an office building with many doors. Some are regular doors (K+ leak channels) that say \"RED SHIRTED PEOPLE ONLY!\", some are gasoline (ATP) powered revolving doors (the pumps). There are also locked doors that say \"BLUE SHIRTED PEOPLE ONLY!\". <\/p>\n\n<p>The scene you should picture is the building filled mostly with people wearing red t-shirts (K+), with a small percentage wearing blue t-shirts (Na+). Outside the building, the situation is reversed (many more blue shirts). On both sides, all people are more gathered against the walls of the building (membrane) than elsewhere. Some <em>very small<\/em> amount of red-shirted people are leaving through dozens of regular red-only doors, in a continual flow. Another very small amount of both red and blue shirted people are going through the revolving doors: two red shirts go in (K+)) while three blue shirts go out (Na+). And there are dozens of these revolving doors in the building. The net effect is that the overall proportion of red to blue shirted people in an outside the building <em>remains the same<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>And of course, every now and then, suddenly lots of blue shirt only doors unlock from some magic command from the building computer, and a noticeable amount of blue shirted people enter the building (an action potential)...but not <em>nearly<\/em> close to enough of them to change the proportions of blue:red in any significant way.

Isn't the voltage fluctuating because of this back and forth movement of K+ out, K+ back in, Na+ in, Na+ back out, etc.? I would imagine this would completely negate the positive/negative charge distribution, but it doesn't. Why?<\/p>\n\n<p>Clarification: there is a net outflow of Potassium and a net inflow of Sodium.

Yes, there is a bigger concentration of K+ inside of the cell, however, there is also a higher concentration of Na+ outside of the cell, and also, there are other charged ions, such as Cl- or proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the main reasons for the gradient is Na+/K+ ATPase, which transports 2 K+ ions to the inside of the cell, while 3 Na+ ions are pumped to the exterior of the cell. This generally yields in a higher concentration of + charge on the outside of the cell.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The final membrane potential depends on the permeability of the membrane to these ions. Higher the permeability for an ion, the closer is the actual potential to the equilibrium potential of this ion. (you can read about its calculation <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation#Nernst_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.<\/a>). Since the membrane in a normal state is not permeable to Na+ to a big extent, but is permeable to K+, the resting potential is similar to the equilibrium potential for K+, which is negative (the actual value depends on the specific cell type, generally we can say -70mV in neurons). (The K+ is driven to exit the cell because of the chemical and electrical gradient, which results in negative charge inside of the cell).

The arteries have more cross-sectional area than the aorta, but they have have much, much more surface area-- way more of a difference than a single pipe with those cross-sectional characteristics would have.<\/p>\n\n<p>So Bernoulli's principle does mean that blood is exerting more pressure on the surface of the arteries and arterioles than it is in the aorta. However, pressure is force per unit area, and there's much more area in the smaller vessels, so the pressure in any single vessel is less.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36451,"question_id":36443,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uS0Elf7lRBo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE8/R5J8cBgSOg8/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16299,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16299/vance-l-albaugh","reputation":1284,"display_name":"Vance L Albaugh"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1455640933,"creation_date":1438260275,"body":"<p>Bernoulli's principle can be a little tricky when applied to the cardiovascular system, but it still holds true across the entire system. You mention a good point that the relationship doesn't seem quite right at the aorta or arteries, because of the constant fluctuation of pressure between systolic and diastolic without a significant change in diameter of the vessel. Remember that this is due to the pulsatile flow of blood from the heart, and has nothing to do with Bernoulli's principle. If the flow was constant (i.e. not pulsatile) then the pressure would be constant as the diameter of the vessels is constant. As the diameter of the vessels begins to decrease the velocity would increase to maintain a constant value. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you mention, Bernoulli's principle describes how the product of area and velocity of flow must be constant across a system. When the total surface area of the system increases, the pressure decreases as well as flow. It is important to remember that even though the capillaries are so small and individually high resistance (which you would think according to Bernoulli's principle should increase the velocity), you are effectively adding an innumerable number of these very small resistors in parallel (not in series) and the resistance overall (and subsequently pressure + flow) decreases greatly. <\/p>\n\n<p>When adding resistance in series the total resistance is additive and it adds up quickly! $$R_{Total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$$\nWhile resistance in parallel adds the reciprocal of the resistor, meaning that as more resistors (or capillary pathways) are added the total resistance continues to decrease because of the following relationship: $$\\frac{1}{R_{Total}} = \\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\frac{1}{R_3}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The parallel resistance stuff was difficult for me to grasp when I was a student, because it never seemed to make sense in my mind that the resistance significantly decreased when you added all these small capillaries. One of my physiology professors described it well when he said, \"Think of adding resistance in parallel, in the way that capillary beds and other vessels are in the cardiovascular system, <strong>like giving the blood another place to go<\/strong>.\" If the blood has more places that it can go, then it's easier to see why resistance falls so much when you add a bunch of extra places for the blood to flow.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36489,"question_id":36443,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1455640933}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36443/how-does-bernoulli-s-principle-apply-to-the-cardiovascular-system","last_activity_date":1455641186,"creation_date":1438090494,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does Bernoulli\u2019s Principle apply to the cardiovascular system?","body":"<p>Below are graphs which illustrate the cross-sectional area, velocity, and fluid pressure through each vascular segment of the cardiovascular system.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aGCSS.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aGCSS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>It makes sense that velocity and cross-sectional area should be inversely related graphically (by the equation of continuity, $v_1A_1=v_2A_2$).

However, in the graph above, clearly pressure is decreasing as you move away from the aorta, regardless of velocity.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can understand how the pressure in capillaries will be higher than those in venules, since a higher pressure in capillaries would accelerate the blood as it moves into the venules with a lesser total cross-sectional area.

This is because \"pockets\" at either end of the binding groove are said to actually grasp the peptide, and it doesn't allow for much longer sequences.

better in the book (1) for the full descriptions. <\/li>\n<li>I skip the physiology of cardiac cycle here for simplicity because it is not needed for explicit definition of heartbeat, but can be used for implicit definition from one-sided and  wrong view as in <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/19306/86\">Tivie's answer<\/a>. \nYou can see in one answer of revision history where I describe how to define little more explicitly the cardiac cycle with seven distinct phases but not relevant to this answer so left out.<\/li>\n<li>The blood pressure machines are not for detecting irregular heartbeats like in Rags' biased comment <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/27472/86\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>One heartbeat can consists of many energy levels from different origins. \nHowever, there are often characteristic energy levels with greatest energy in the normal heartbeat.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Irregular heartbeat<\/h2>\n\n<p>Irregular heartbeat has irregularities in energy level and time interval. \nIn contrast, cardiac rhythm can have irregularities only in time interval, which is the reason why we do not look the case here from the view.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Irregular heartbeat for the blood pressure monitor -machine<\/h2>\n\n<p>I now describe how the heartbeat is detected simplistically and giving you an overview about how these machines work. <\/p>\n\n<p>The blood pressure monitors detect first the amplitudes of the heartbeat in time interval. \nThey convert the data into different energy levels and do analysis based on both energy level and time interval. <\/p>\n\n<p>Irregular heartbeats form from the Pacemaker cells (SA node, AV node and Purkinje fibers) which maintain the cardiac rhythm and the energy of the heartbeat. \nThey can be arrythmic (rarely benign) or tachycardic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each machine is designed little differently but they have some components the same. \nThey are designed for the normal physiologic condition at rest, not often for different pathologies, arrhythmias, tachycardia, fast respiration, temporary diseases and accelerative movements.\nThey try to skip some major distractions in doing the calculation. \nI skip the specific algorithms in doing these simplifications and approximations, see the revision history for a stub about this topic. <\/p>\n\n<p>The blood pressure monitors detect arterial blood pressure, do analysis based on it and its applications, and estimates blood pressure. \nGood machines use the characteristic energy levels and time interval together in analysis. \nThe characteristic energy levels can be differentiated to the origin, since we know which frequency corresponds to each pacemaker:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sinoatrial node (70-80 Hz)<\/li>\n<li>AV node beating too early (40-55 Hz)<\/li>\n<li>Bundle of His (40 Hz)<\/li>\n<li>Purkinje fibers (15-40 Hz)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The good machine has to be able to distinguish between pulse (P) and respiratory waves (R). \nIt ignores most often the vasomotor wave (V) because the interval of measurement is so short. \nSee the Figure for those waves in one picture:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9PlzY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where the vasomotor wave can be deduced by trendline or appropriate time-series analysis.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary<\/strong>. \nGood blood pressure monitoring machines estimate the blood pressure of the heartbeat  through the characteristic energy levels in time interval. \nThe analysis and diagnosis of the irregular heartbeat is however much more difficult.

If you are talking about someone outdoors not properly dressed in a Scandinavian winter, then their cutaneous vasculature would constrict and Also their extremities would get less blood flow. That would increase peripheral vascular resistance and thus decrease cardiac output. These articles were the first to pop up for me (<a href=\"http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/7/3/366\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/7/3/366<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10215232\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10215232<\/a>) and it seems to say that the primary cause of increased vascular resistance is actually caused by decreased cardiac output as well as local control.<\/p>\n\n<p>This may seem contradictory to therapeutic use of hypothermia, where it is used to decrease metabolic needs (I don't know what is the mechanism for this) to help compensate for hypoxia (in cardiac tissue and the brain?). Cooling the heart would decrease it's metabolic needs (less perfusion, increased metabolic demands resulting from sympathetic input to heart. I guess the same thing probably happens when doctors prescribe a beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), the vascular resistance probably increases (except for the CCB diltiazem which dilates blood vessels in addition to it's effects on the heart). But the main thing is the sympathetic output to the heart, which is blocked by these drugs, and cold; this is more important than the increased peripheral vascular resistance. But <strong>remember that afterload is not identical to peripheral vascular resistance<\/strong>!!! The decreased cardiac output would probably decrease blood pressure and afterload, I'm guessing.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the slowing of reactions related to vasoconstriction (transmission of nervous signal from hypothalamus via pre ganglionic sympathetic fiber, then synapse in sympathetic chain, then transmission via post ganglionic nerve; release of NE, Epi, AT-II; rate of diffusion to receptor; effect of cold on membrane fluidity; effect on the alpha adrenergic receptor; rate of second messenger signalling cascade; effect of cAMP formation by G stimulator protein or breakdown by phosphodiesterase; effect of Ca++ release; effect on PLC mediated IP3/DAG release; effect on NO release and receptor stimulation of guanylate cyclase;  and the various other factors regulating endothelial function and smooth muscle contraction), I don't know. I also assume that an increase in viscosity (a factor included in the calculation of vascular resistance) could be another factor leading to increased vascular resistance, but even if this happens, this is less important than the decrease of the hearts metabolic rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally I'm not acquainted with the literature on therapeutic use of hypothermia, aside from the ethical debates about using Nazi hypothermia research. I'm just going at it with the same physiology knowledge you have, and relaying your confusion back at you. I'm just as lazy as you and I don't feel like spending hours delving into review articles on hypothermia research, but I agree that it is an interesting question, and it is also relevant to other very important topics in medicine (ie. use of beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCBs other than diltiazem).<\/p>\n","answer_id":27492,"question_id":27474,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1420781343},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1455601735,"creation_date":1424946198,"body":"<h2>Winter swimming and infarcts<\/h2>\n\n<p>The publication <a href=\"http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273(14)01865-8/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Long-term risks of cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases increased following winter swimming in the cold seawater<\/a> which came out just some weeks ago shows a link between long-term winter swimming and CVD. \nI think this is the best evidence so far about the possible link. <\/p>\n\n<h2>WYSIWYG's comment has some good general idea:<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many processes are affected by temperature including metabolism and\n  growth rates.

Thus, hypoxia can occur and asymptomatic exodus may occur. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Physiological case<\/h2>\n\n<p>Based on physiology, I can propose that the cardiac output curve shifts to the left (CO1 $\\to$ CO2), due to less oxygen being supplied to the heart, similarly EDV1 (end-diastolic volume) shifts $\\to$ EDV2 and SV1 (stroke volume) $\\to$ SV2. \nHowever, the venous return (VR) curve can shift much more, since I propose that the effect of temperature on smooth musculature is relatively bigger than on heart because of proportional size of tissue. \nSo the VR1 shifts to VR2, so EDV2 $\\to$ EDV3 and SV2 $\\to$ SV3.\nConsequently, SV3 > SV1, while EDV3 &lt; EDV1. \nSee my draft figure about this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PKSEA.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where EDV (End Diastolic Volume) in the x-axis and SV (Stroke Volume) in the y-axis.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a healthy person, who have no hypertrophy of ventricles and elastic myocardium, the heart can tolerate this.

The terminology is undoubtedly described in reputable sources, but it is unlikely a paper is dedicated solely to explain this terminology, making literature searches tricky. Having said that -  <\/p>\n\n<p>I discussed this question with an anthropologist and she agrees with my idea that the terminology Old and New World is a historic and Euro-centric one, dating back to the <a href=\"http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/colonial/jb_colonial_subj.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">colonial times<\/a> when Europe viewed itself as the center of the world. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/columbus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Americas were discovered<\/a> relatively early, around 1492.

Australia wasn't found until <a href=\"http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/columbus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">around 1606<\/a>. By that time the New World was already a century old and very likely already solidly associated with the Americas. <\/p>\n\n<p>The New World, in a biological context, is often used to describe groups of closely related species found in the Americas and not elsewhere, such as <a href=\"http://anthro.palomar.edu/primate/prim_5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">New World monkeys<\/a>. In certain areas of expertise the terminology is baked in in the jargon, .e.g,  monkey and ape behavioral research areas. New World monkeys can be referred to by the <em>Cebidae<\/em>, as per the <a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linnaeus's classification<\/a>. However, due to practical reasons geographical clustering of species can be more convenient.<\/p>\n\n<p>The term New World means different things in a biological context or in the context of <a href=\"http://vinepair.com/wine-101/guide-old-world-vs-new-world-wines/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wines<\/a>, for example (Americas versus Americas + Australia - admittedly Australian wines are pretty good). <\/p>\n\n<p>In all, I think the terminology 'New and Old World' is confusing, rooted in historical considerations.
