Once you're sure of this, the western blot will give you an indication as to where your protein is (approximately) being cleaved.

There are a TON of proteases that could be potentially cleaving your peptide and you need to have a hypothesis as to what that could be. Your peptide could be cleaved by an endopeptidase (cutting within), or a carboxypeptidase (C-terminal cleavage) or an aminopeptidase (N-termainal cleavage).

For instance, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin\" rel=\"nofollow\">prolactin<\/a> can bind to two receptors, called prolactin receptor (PRL-R) short and long form. The short form of the receptor has been shown to lack the ability to promote milk protein genes transcription (See <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50906/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lesueur et al., PNAS - 1991<\/a>).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the same receptor can be coupled to different intracellular pathways in different cell types / physiological conditions, thus resulting in different effects.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>each cell type/tissue expresses a set of protein that will interact in a different manner with the intracellular cascade promoted by the hormone.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>an hormone can interact with receptors for other molecules. For instance allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, is a potent agonist of the GABA-A receptor, giving it anxiolitic properties.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>An interesting example is that of estrogenic compound. Several receptors exist for estradiol (E2). The \"classical\" receptors are called ER-alpha and ER-beta, and they are located in the cytoplasm. The binding of E2 to the ER promotes their dimerization and entrance into the nucleus where they can promote the transcription of various genes. ERs can also bind to other transcription factors and modulate their activity. So, depending on which transcription factors are present different genes will be transcribed in response to E2. Moreover, ER-beta can have opposite effects then ER-alpha (see for instance <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18537/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weihua et al., PNAS - 2000<\/a>). In addition, receptors like ERs can be activated also in absence of the endogenous hormone: for instance, dietary amino acids activate ER-alpha in liver by a mTOR-dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21284987\" rel=\"nofollow\">Della Torre et al., Cell Metabolism 2011<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>To make things more complicated, membrane receptor for estrogen have been described, such as GPR30 (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15705806\" rel=\"nofollow\">Revankar et al., Science - 2005<\/a>), membrane \"versions\" of the classical ERs, plus various splicing variants of the ERs (mostly expressed in tumoral tissue).<\/p>\n\n<p>GPR30 in breasts has been shown to activate certain molecular pathways (notably Erk1/2) that contribute to cellular growth (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11043579\" rel=\"nofollow\">Filardo et al., Mol Endocrinol. - 2000<\/a>), possibly linking it to proliferation of ER-negative breast tumours. Other tissues that do not express GPR30 will lack this E2-induced proliferative stimulus.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, tissue- or time- dependent modulation of the receptors and of the intracellular pathways associated with it can allow the body to respond to the same hormone (or, more in general, to the same molecule) in opposite ways.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1<\/sup> This is a simplification, not every substance (and not every hormone) acts by binding to receptors, but let's keep things simple.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1374,"question_id":1371,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1331558067}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1371/single-hormone-opposite-effects","last_activity_date":1331558067,"creation_date":1331451013,"answer_count":1,"title":"Single hormone opposite effects","body":"<p>Often, a smooth response to a hormone means that some processes must be sped up and others must be slowed down.<\/p>\n\n<p>How can a single hormone have opposite effects like this?<\/p>\n","question_id":1371,"tags":["biochemistry","endocrinology","chemical-communication"],"score":7,"accepted_answer_id":1374,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2728,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1331467133},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0dcafedb083e3fafd2f46d15ccc48db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":611,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/611/simon-verbeke","reputation":361,"display_name":"Simon Verbeke","accept_rate":100},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57be4913af31870b7cef57aeab4aa75e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":575,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/575/emmie-mc","reputation":769,"display_name":"Emmie MC","accept_rate":100},"score":9,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1331518582,"creation_date":1331518582,"body":"<p>Your retina has two kinds of light-sensing nerves: cones and rods.

Due to variations in prey populations, and low efficiency of consumption at higher trophic levels, they are subject to inconsistent and unpredictable food supply (<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1936843\">Greenstone and Bennett, 1980<\/a>). They are very well adapted to this lifestyle and consequently, long periods of starvation often yield no behavioural changes (<a href=\"http://www.susqu.edu/facstaff/p/persons/animalbehavior1999.pdf\">Persons, 1999<\/a>). It is highly unlikely that the spider will die after just one day: <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1935148\">Anderson, (1974)<\/a> observed no changes in activity after starving <em>Lycosa lenta<\/em> (a species of wolf spider) for 30 days; and <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/v2k50682641n0l85/\">Tanaka and Ito, (1982)<\/a> observed <em>Pardosa astrigera<\/em> (another species of wolf spider) living for up to 54 days of starvation.

I'm a mathematical epidemiologist, so I'd at least like to believe these types of models are useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>For me, there are a number of things population dynamics models are especially useful for:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlighting data requirements. Yes, models need data, as you've mentioned. But they don't need all their data to come from one source, one study, or even one <em>field<\/em>. Models are also profoundly useful for showing where we <em>don't<\/em> have the data we need to fully understand a system. \"To make a model where we understand A, we need the values for X, Y, and Z. X is well studied, but Y and Z aren't - though it turns out when we look over the entire parameter space for Z, nothing really changes in our answer. But guys? We could really use a study on Y.\"<\/li>\n<li>Eliminating guesswork. Models aren't perfect encapsulations of reality - there will always be some simplifying assumptions, etc. But it's better than \"going with your gut\" - especially for complex problems.<\/li>\n<li>Impossible studies. A ton of what mathematical epidemiology looks at it is areas where studies are either impossible, logistically difficult, or unethical. It would be very hard indeed to only be able to study pandemic response plans, or vaccination strategy only when we had an actual outbreak, or while a new vaccine is being rolled out.<\/li>\n<li>Highlighting potentially new directions. If you're considering an intervention, but no matter how effective you make it in your model it doesn't move the system much, it might not be worthwhile. Models can also highlight threshold effects - like the critical % of the population you'd need to vaccinate to achieve herd immunity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":1323,"question_id":1310,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49e94b363348f897f337a5bce2beec20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":68,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/68/marta-cz-c","reputation":1717,"display_name":"Marta Cz-C","accept_rate":50},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1331160596,"creation_date":1331151581,"body":"<p>Two previous answers listed many applications of population dynamics models.

Information about number of offspring, breeding success, natural mortality, etc can usually be gain without serious perturbation of wild populations. The number of individuals in every natural population fluctuates because of random reasons, so it is possible (but sometimes needs more field work) to calculate, (possibly nonlinear) regression between density of population and some demographic indicators and then extrapolate it to non-examined densities. For some small, short-living species it is sometimes possible to measure that correlations in laboratory or semi-wild conditions. For some long-living species, especially if they are sedentary, like trees, it may be better to compare specimens living in different distance from its neighborhoods.

From this information, one can learn about some curiosity traits (say, sensing asparagus metabolites in the urine, slow or fast twitch muscles, curly vs not curly hair) and, more importantly, about disease risk. Ancestry and family relationships can also be learned as in, for example, a half-sibling relationship.<\/p>\n\n<p>As many diseases are polygenic with numerous loci each making small contributions to the variance, it becomes very difficult to fully describe the level of increased or decreased risk. In other words, we don't yet know all the players and so assessing their contribution to risk of disease can't be done with complete confidence. To further compound this problem are both epistasis and gene-environment interactions. Epistasis is a gene-gene (gene-gene-gene, etc) interaction, such that genes A and B separately make no contribution to the phenotype (disease risk), but do so in combination - say in ab/ab individuals. A gene-environment interaction can be described as when an allele associates with increased risk only when an environmental factor (e.g., exercise, fat in the diet, sun exposure, oxygen tension (altitude), etc), passes a certain threshold.<\/p>\n\n<p>Still, the most powerful predictor of disease risk, onset and progression is family history. A genome sequence approaches that history (half your genome is from your mother and half from your father, of course), but remains fairly uninterpretable in terms of complex traits. You may carry a couple variants posing increased risk for heart disease, but what about the other hundred or so loci that also make small contributions to this affliction? Sure, if we knew exactly what those other hundred were and how much they each contribute and if they interact with each other or the environment. An incomplete picture emerges.<\/p>\n\n<p>With rare diseases and altered genomes (say in cancer compared to normal) great strides are being made to either identify the small number of defective genes (rare diseases) or the commandeered pathways exploited for uncontrolled growth (cancer). In this regard, much can be learned and will have quicker, but still measurable in years, applications to the clinic.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1268,"question_id":1266,"up_vote_count":9},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01bbb59a1c3ef9960f25a97afe7e920f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":576,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/576/andrew-grimm","reputation":159,"display_name":"Andrew Grimm"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35114dfb827dc71cb3a8ff281617c5b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/535/larry-parnell","reputation":3430,"display_name":"Larry_Parnell"},"score":0,"post_id":1276,"edited":false,"creation_date":1330716437,"comment_id":1545,"body":"Sure, there is this curiosity factor that is outside health.

However, it has recently been suggested that blanket screening for cancer may not be the best idea due to bad side-effects and cost associated with treatment of false positives (which you'll get if you screen a sufficient number of people).

In addition, mean surface temperatures are ~210 K (-63 C), the surface ultraviolet flux is extremely high (no ozone layer) and an aridity comparable to the Atacama desert. On the plus side, a 95% CO2 atmosphere might promote photosynthesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, higher plants are extremely unlikely to prosper on Mars. Purely in terms of pressure, <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/25feb_greenhouses/\">experiments suggest<\/a> that at 1/10 Earth atmospheric pressure vascular plant transpiration increases significantly. So much so that they enter into a drought response which often leads to plant death.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, lichens may be another matter. These are often adapted to low precipitation/pressure environments such as high mountains. Indeed, this <a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2009.0362\">article<\/a> addresses exactly your question (sadly it is not open access).

The median length of a yeast protein is\n  385 amino acids, with a combined biosynthesis and polymerization cost\n  of 30.3 ∼P per amino acid. The median abundance is 2,460 protein\n  molecules per cell. No currently available data allows a meaningful\n  estimate of the median protein half-life, but a protein of an\n  intermediate half-life (see below) of 10 h (decay constant dP = 1.92 ×\n  10−5 s−1) yields an overall synthesis cost of 30.3 × 385 × 2,460 ×\n  (1.92 × 10−5) = 551 ∼P s−1.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For your question about a single gene, the cost would be 49.3 * 1474 ~P for the mRNA and 30.3 * 385 ~P for the translation, which would result in around 84 thousand ~P. This is probably a very misleading statistic as you can transcribe multiple proteins from a single mRNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>How the cost of mRNA synthesis and translation are calculated is described in detail in the paper. A large part of the cost comes from the synthesis of the basic building blocks, the nucleotides and the amino acids.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msi126\">Wagner, A.

While it can prevent rapid spread of some things, keep in mind that anti-bacterial soaps should only have specific uses.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3_supp/levy.htm\">The CDC has concerns about the prevalent use of these products<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scientists are concerned that the antibacterial agents will select bacteria resistant to them and cross-resistant to antibiotics. Moreover, if they alter a person's microflora, they may negatively affect the normal maturation of the T helper cell response of the immune system to commensal flora antigens; this change could lead to a greater chance of allergies in children. As with antibiotics, prudent use of these products is urged. Their designated purpose is to protect vulnerable patients.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, there is some concern as outlined by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis\">hygiene hypothesis<\/a> (WP).  However, that is mostly <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070905174501.htm\">associated with childhood immunities and allergies<\/a> as opposed to the effects on adults.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThe natural immune system does not have as much to do as it did 50 years ago because we\u2019ve increased our efforts to protect our children from dirt and germs,\u201d says McMorris.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u201cAllergies are on the rise because our society has changed the way we live. As a result, people with allergies are having children with others who have allergies, which in turn creates a natural increase in the prevalence of allergies in our society.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The bottom line on this hypothesis is that <a href=\"http://www.usc.edu/hsc/info/pr/hmm/00-01winter/germs.html\">more research is required<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He (Richard G. Barbers, M.D., USC professor of medicine at the Keck School) also gives credence to the hygiene hypothesis in that \"we may be over-protecting kids, and their immune systems, consequently, do not become well-developed.\"<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Barbers notes that only time and a lot more research will tell whether the hygiene hypothesis is valid, and whether, once again, parents should let their kids play in the dirt. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is <a href=\"http://www.physorg.com/news183810398.html\">generally understood that interaction with beneficial germs is good for you<\/a>.  However, normal cleaning will not destroy these germs since they reside within you (unless his germaphobia induces him to take antibiotics).  The human immune response doesn't particularly work that way.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The investigators show that \"good\" bacteria in the gut keep the immune system primed to more effectively fight infection from invading pathogenic bacteria. Altering the intricate dynamic between resident and foreign bacteria - via antibiotics, for example -- compromises an animal's immune response, specifically, the function of white blood cells called neutrophils.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Using too many anti-bacterial soaps has <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2005/11/14/hlsc1114.htm\">raised quite a few concerns even still<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Soaps and lotions that include antibacterial agents have no benefit over ordinary soap and water, but more research is needed to allay or substantiate concern that these substances may be leading to increased rates of antibiotic resistance. This is the conclusion of the Food and Drug Administration's Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee, which met last month to consider the use of these products outside of the health care setting.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\"In the absence of proven benefit, there's no real reason to encourage the use of these products,\" said Alastair J.J.

The location of the centromere on the chromosome is encoded by a specific nucleosome composition and does not seem to rely on the DNA that wraps around those nucleosomes: The DNA sequence at centromeres is not even conserved from chromosome to chromosome (with the exception of budding yeast), and there are several known examples of people and families where the centromere is in a different place.

Here's a summary:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC523762/\">Determination of the optimal aligned spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the translation initiation codon of Escherichia coli mRNAs.<\/a> by Chen, Bjerknes, Kumar, &amp; Jay. Nucleic Acids Research. (1994)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Experiment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The authors constructed a series of synthetic RBS regions that varied the length separating a synthetic 5-nt Shine-Dalgarno sequence from the start codon.  The regions varied in size between 2 to 17 nt.  They assayed the activity of a downstream enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The authors concluded that the optimal spacing between a consensus 5-nt Shine-Dalgarno sequence (5'-GAGGT-3') and the start site <strong>was 5 nt<\/strong>. Note: this synthetic SD was made of the <em>last<\/em> 5 nt of a 9 nt SD consensus sequence.  They also tested a synthetic SD made from the <em>first<\/em> 5 nt (5'-TAAGG-3')of the consensus SD.  In this case they found the optimal distance was <strong>9 nt<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the optimal distance depends on where your desired SD aligns with the consensus SD sequence, which optimally is <strong>5 nt<\/strong> from the start.  Read on for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Details<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>the RBS is considered to be large, extending 20bp on either side of a core Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence.  These days, I often hear of the RBS spoken of in sizes that are equivalent to the SD.  So in the parlance of the paper, you question is rephrased as \"how does distance of the SD from the start codon effect translation?\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the canonical SD sequence referenced in the paper is 5'-UAAGGAGGU-3'.  It is 9 nucleotides long.  Distances between the SD and the start codon are defined as the number of nucleotides separate the 3' Uracil of the SD from the Adenine of the start AUG.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Example: the distance is 5 nt in the following mRNA<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>       5'.....UAAGGAGGUnnnnnAUG......3'\n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p>if the SD is not a complete 9 nt long, the distance is between the position of where the canonical Uracil <em>would<\/em> occur.  In the following example, the distance is still calculated as 5 nt:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>       5'.....UAAGGAnnnnnnnnAUG......3'\n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p>the average distance between the SD sequence and the start codon varies considerably and on average is 7 nt. Other investigators have found \"optimal\" spacing (circa 1994) ranged from 5 to 13 nt.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the SD site complements with region on the 16s rRNA. The start codon complements to the anticodon of fMet-tRNA loaded into the ribosomal P-site.

The effect is calculated as the percentage of cells that undergo the transformation from normal into cancer cells. Two metrics are available here:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>DT<\/strong> = Tumorigenic Dose (the amount of substance causing certain\n  percentage of cancer in treated animals, all treated animals are taken\n  for 100%)<br>\n  <strong>CT<\/strong> = Tumorigenic Concentration (same, but adjusted for\n  concentration and used in cell cultures).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(They are written CT and DT because in science people tend to used Latin abbreviations where the adjective actually follows the noune).<\/p>\n\n<p>The common metrics are DT5/CT5 (5% cells/animals get cancer) and DT50/CT50 (50% of the animals). Those are similar to other common metrics, the most common is LC50/LD50 -- lethal dose for 50% of the animals/cells.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I couldn't not find any pre-compiled list with most known cancerogens and their TD/TC values.

For integration into the genome of a bacterium, you would need to use an \"integration\" vector. Most commercial vectors (such as pUC18) will be maintained without integrating into the host genome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a description of an integration vector from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center to give you an idea of how foreign DNA would be integrated into a Bacillus genome: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Integration vectors are plasmids that feature conditional replication\n  coupled with a selectable marker. If the plasmid is transformed into\n  an appropriate host under conditions that select for the plasmid\u2019s\n  presence but restrict its replication, all transformants will have\n  integrated the plasmid into their chromosome (or some other resident\n  DNA capable of replicating under the selective conditions). In\n  practice, the selectable marker usually specifies antibiotic\n  resistance. Conditional replication usually means that the plasmid has\n  replication functions that work in E. coli but not in gram-positive\n  bacteria, such as B. subtilis. Sometimes a temperature-sensitive\n  replication phenotype is employed instead. Integration is targeted to\n  a particular locus on the chromosome by including identical sequences\n  on the plasmid. If there is a single homologous sequence, a single\n  crossover will integrate the entire chromosome into the target locus\n  by a Campbell-type mechanism. If there are two homologous sequences,\n  and they are relatively close together on the chromosome, then a\n  double crossover will result in a cassette integrating between the\n  chromosomal targets.

This may make it difficult to identify the exact selection processes operating on any one species. In contrast, something like the eye has a well-defined single function, which in principle at least, makes it easier to understand the link between form and function.<\/p>\n\n<p>From Niklas (1988):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Life history and optimisation theory suggest that the number of\n  phenotypic solutions that allow for different equally successful trait\n  combinations increases as the number of trade-offs increases \u2013 a\n  conclusion that applies to traits within the leaf (e.g. for shape) as\n  well as to leaf\u2013branch relationships.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there are a  number of ideas to explain leaf shape diversity which include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thermoregulation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It has been shown that by adding lobes to leaves, the rate of heat transfer across a leaf is greater than that of an unlobed leaf of the same area (e.g. Gurevitch and Schuepp 1990). So, lobed leaves may be selected for under certain environmental conditions.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>hydromechanical constraints<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Lobed leaves may have greater hydraulic efficiency. For smaller veins, hydraulic pressure increases as they present an increased resistance to water flow. This places stress on the deliate outer leaf tissues. If  lobed leaves have relatively less mesophyll tissue than large, highly conductive veins, they may have reduced hydraulic resistance compared  unlobed leaves (Sack and Tyree 2005).<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>optimization for photosynthesis<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>adaptations against herbivorous animals<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>random (non-selected) variation.
