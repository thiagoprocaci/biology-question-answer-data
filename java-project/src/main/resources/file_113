Currents as little as few microampers can kill a person if, for example, applied directly next to the heart. A few seconds of 220V can kill a person even if the current is in miliamper range (Biksom, cited below, mentions 4s at 120mA). However, it is true that it is not the voltage <em>alone<\/em> that kills, that there are other factors (most importantly, the effective current, which, however, normally increases with voltage). <\/p>\n\n<p>Look, Ohms law states that R = V / I (resistance equals to voltage divided by current). Given a constant resistance, a higher voltage produces also a higher current, full stop. Given a voltage of, say, 24 V, and the resistance of our bodies being 1000 - 4000 Ohm, the current will not exceed 6 - 24 mA. Note that in case of 220V this largest current would be less than ten times these values, so well below 1A! Yet, this is sufficient to kill an adult.<\/p>\n\n<p>What's more, extremely high voltage can actually break the skin and effectively <em>lower<\/em> the skin resistance, which results in an even higher current (see formula above).<\/p>\n\n<p>So where does this popular knowledge come from? Well, we know that things like electric sparks can have very high voltage, but are harmless. They are harmless not because the current is low, but because the <em>duration<\/em> and the total energy is low, since the total energy is given by power (in watts) times seconds, and power P = V * I (voltage times current).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, it comes from anecdotical evidence, since being shocked by thousands of Volts and survive can make you famous... precisely because it is extremely rare to get into contact with a high voltage line which can supply a steady flow of the current and survive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another reason became apparent in the comments: confusion between the <em>factual<\/em> current of the jolt one is getting and the <em>nominal<\/em> amps on the fuse. The former is given by the resistance and voltage; the higher the voltage, the higher the current.

Enzymes in particular will have less information because of the changes in binding partners our physical conformation to be enzymatically active. If you think there should be known info then I would try Google Scholar, Pubmed and a google search, in that order.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong>\nThe intended meaning of the question is related to spectroscopy and quantification of protein concentration. There are two common ways to determine protein concentration using optical methods (spectroscopy). The methods use colorimetric assays (colour intensity is proportional to protein concentration) or light absorbance at a reference wavelength. Both methods rely on light absorbance at a specific wavelength, but the former relies on an reagent that changes colour in response to protein quantity, and the latter depends on direct UV light absorbance. Here's a quick breakdown of each.<\/p>\n\n<p>For both of these assays, to determine the quantity of a specific protein, they require a source of purified protein.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Colorimetric Assays:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>These are traditional biochemical assays, of which the most widely used are the: Bradford, BCA and Lowry protein assays. These assays rely on reduction-oxidation reactions between the key assay reagent (Bradford's reagent, bicinchonic acid, or Lowry's reagent) and protein. For example, the BCA reagent is reduced in the presence of protein, causing a chelated copper ion, Cu(II), to be reduced to Cu(I), and effecting a purple colour. This purple colour intensity, which read at a specific wavelength (~520 nm) will indicate the amount of protein.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Near-UV Absorbance:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This method relies on 280 nm (near-UV) absorbance. Usually absorbance at 260 nm is also used for a correction factor. Specifically, amino acids with aromatic rings (eg, tryptophan) cause absorption at 280 nm. Peptide bonds absorb at 200 nm, and various other bonds, pH, ionic conditions, all influence and absorb at various wavelengths.<\/p>\n\n<p>These methods cannot be used with a protein sample alone, because there are a number of conditions that can affect readings. To correct for this, a protein standard is also used. A protein standard uses a series of known concentrations of a known protein. The common protein concentrations can range from 20-2000 &micro;g/mL; the common protein standards are bovine serum albumin, chicken ovalbumin or purified IgG. The protein standard acts as a reference for protein concentrations that are valid for that experiment, under those specific conditions. A curve is fit to the readings of the protein standard, and the sample concentrations can be read off the standard curve by using the absorbance readings.<\/p>\n","answer_id":4947,"question_id":4946,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1350430581}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/4946/are-there-any-websites-offering-graphs-for-the-light-absorption-of-different-enz","last_activity_date":1350438509,"creation_date":1350415759,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any websites offering graphs for the light absorption of different enzymes?","body":"<p>I have found graphs for the light absorption of water, haemoglobin, lipids, melanin, etc., but I am having a hard time finding graphs about enzymes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Are there any websites or other reference sources for this type of information?<\/p>\n","question_id":4946,"tags":["biochemistry","enzymes"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":4947,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":140,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1350438509},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/222b478bab6d59dc5de514a87dba88cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":389,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/389/bobthejoe","reputation":4911,"display_name":"bobthejoe","accept_rate":53},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff3e84bcedd40163c74d33b827ac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/307/lancelafontaine","reputation":3814,"display_name":"LanceLafontaine","accept_rate":47},"score":0,"post_id":3210,"edited":false,"creation_date":1345220915,"comment_id":4790,"body":"<a href=\"http://the-scientist.com/2012/08/16/dna-data-storage/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the-scientist.com/2012/08/16/dna-data-storage<\/a>, for the lazier."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a43651dba3f306d9c0c0b92a7457722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1441,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1441/bitwise","reputation":1705,"display_name":"Bitwise"},"score":0,"post_id":3210,"edited":false,"creation_date":1350429894,"comment_id":6977,"body":"My own view is that while reading DNA has advanced (and is still advancing) immensely, but writing is very much a work in process and still has a long way to go.

I can't find anything better than the review you point out. All I can do is add a few interesting notes since 2001.  Nothing really turns over Rattenborg et al. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sleep is itself a poorly understood process and most of the theories of the necessity of sleep can teeter precariously with discoveries like this report that <a href=\"http://www.bri.ucla.edu/bri_weekly/news_050714.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">baby dolphins and killer whales and their mothers simply don't sleep at all for the first few months of life<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The Rattenborg review is only guessing, but I think its clear that there is a cost to unihemispheric sleep, even if we don't know what it is.  Cetaceans and birds and perhaps reptiles having unihemispheric sleep are all cases where there are perpetual and strong selection forces that maintain the ability in these animals.  Without <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432899000704\" rel=\"nofollow\">constant predation experienced by tasty ducks<\/a> or the vagaries of being an air-breathing underwater mammal, animals quickly lose their ability to sleep with one half their brain, one assumes because the ability to maintain it is particular and easily lost with variation.  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960411\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modelling work of the hemispheres<\/a> in sleep indicates that the connections between the hemispheres are modulated between the two modes of sleep - there may be advantages to such brain structures for instance. <\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://takingapartcats.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/halfbrain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post<\/a> is a good read though and a bit more recent, though most of the references are from before 2001.

Mediaeval authors, however, gave the 50s\n  as the age when menses ceased-much closer to the timing for twentieth\n  century women.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Jean Ginsburg in [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.gate1.inist.fr/pubmed/2059681\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>] states (emphasis mine):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the past 100 years data from schoolchildren have shown a steady\n  fall in the age at menarche in industrialised communities. Has\n  there been a corresponding change in the age at the menopause?\n  Unfortunately, reported surveys of the menopause have suffered from\n  methodological defects. [...] <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, those studies least subject to bias show a striking\n  agreement that the median age at the menopause is currently around 50\n  in Western industrialised societies. In Britain it is 50.78, in the\n  United States 49.8 and in white South Africans 48.7 <strong>with little\n  apparent change over the past century.<\/strong> In non-European women, however,\n  the menopause seems to occur earlier-in South Africa and the United\n  States black women have an earlier menopause than white women.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, while early menarche is, apparently, irrelevant, age of onset of menopause has increased since antiquity but has remained relatively stable since the middle ages.

This ratio is an\n  important component of what is called the redox state of a cell, a\n  measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health\n  of cells. The effects of the NAD+/NADH ratio are complex,\n  controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including\n  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.\n  In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD+\n  and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus\n  favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total\n  NAD+/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 0.05 to 4. In\n  contrast, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is\n  the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key\n  to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So here's my question: how does this manifest in vertebrate aging?

Does anyone know how this can be explained?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, depending on the depth you want to introduce her to, it can be difficult to explain to <em>adults<\/em> - much less children. You explained the basics well enough. Without going to the molecular mechanisms, here's a useful diagram:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2fgFZ.gif\" alt=\"Rods and Cones\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Light will pass through the eye and Retina until it hits the Cones and Rods. That produces a reaction (which I'll address next) - which then causes signals to either resume or cease (Rods are, ironically, shut off by light - not turned on). These signals pass through Ganglion cells, through the Optic Nerve, and interpreted by the brain. When some cells are switched on, like a 3-Way traffic stop, they will prevent the information from other cells being transmitted. <\/p>\n\n<p>A <em>simple<\/em> way of explaining it might be that inside our eyes are millions of teeny-tiny molecules that act like light-switches, and the brightness and color of light determine which of the \"light-switches\" are on or off.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to go further into the actual mechanisms (or just have the background knowledge for future reference) the next diagram shows the mechanism itself (<a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1531/2881/F1.large.jpg\">and the original in full-size since the one shown is squished if you prefer<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2OJLV.jpg\" alt=\"Protein conform mechanism\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The big things to note above is the change from <em>cis<\/em>-Retinal to <em>trans<\/em>-Retinal which occurs after a Photon is absorbed. This causes signaling molecules to go a bit wild, open ion channels, and the depolarization of the membrane propagates the charge down the cell - much like a neuron.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have never quite understood this idea that an object has a colour depending on the light that hits it. Okay, I understand that in low light objects have a different colour because there is a not much light hitting it and that different objects absorb different wavelengths of light and therefore appear as different colours.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let me stop you here. Low-light is a different situation than colored-light. Let's get the basics down:<\/p>\n\n<p>Photons are absorbed by the electrons of the atoms that compose the molecules of an object. Whatever <em>Wavelength<\/em> of light is not absorbed by the electrons is <strong>reflected<\/strong>, and it's this <em>Wavelength<\/em> that we perceive as the color of the object as our Cones absorb the reflected light.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photons can also be <strong>emitted<\/strong> when an electron moves to a lower-energy state. The <em>Wavelength<\/em> emitted by the electron is directly related to the difference between the High and Low energy states, as this diagram shows fairly well:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cn2SI.jpg\" alt=\"Photon emission\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>emitted<\/strong> photons are the object's \"Incandescence\" - which is when an object produces a color of light by itself. The color you perceive is NOT going to change if the object emits incandescent light because the object is <em>generating<\/em> its own light. Neon signs are a great example: The gases being subjected to a current <em>emit<\/em> light, and will appear whatever color it's supposed to be whether or not it's a blue moon or sunset.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photons which are <strong>reflected<\/strong> and not emitted - i.e. almost everything that doesn't have a power source - as I said above, are then absorbed by our Cones and our brain interprets the signals to produce a color.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason why objects that <strong>reflect<\/strong> light can change color is because not all environmental light is the same. Red objects will appear Black under Blue light because Blue light <em>doesn't contain Red Wavelengths<\/em> - there's nothing to reflect, so the object absorbs all of the available Wavelengths - the very definition of Black!<\/p>\n\n<p>A lot of our color perception depends on ambient light, and most of the time - thanks to the Sun - that is a full-spectrum white light. Which brings me to answer the last bit of your question:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What I don't understand is that if I place a bar of gold a bar of silver side by side in the same lighting conditions they do have different colours, so therefore there must be something inherent in these object that give them different colours. What is that something?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, there definitely <em>is<\/em> something inherent in both objects. That is: Their electron configurations absorb different chunks of the spectrum, and accordingly reflect different chunks of the spectrum. Although that's still a bit simplistic, since metals have some unique properties that other Elements do not. Their electrons exist in more of an \"ocean\" than around central atoms, but that's a whole other question.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a fun bit of Trivia to impress your daughter when she's old enough, it's always a fun fact to know that the color <strong>Yellow<\/strong> is <em>completely constructed in your head<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The human eye <strong>only<\/strong> has Rho (Red), Gamma (Green), and Beta (Blue) color receptors which have the following absorption pattern (from photo.net):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DXGWy.jpg\" alt=\"Human Cone absorption spectrum\"><\/p>\n\n<p>What everybody sees as \"Yellow\" is actually when both the Green and Red receptors are activated at the Wavelength where they intercept above, which your brain interprets as \"Yellow\":<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wlDyV.jpg\" alt=\"Color sensitivity\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Because your brain does <strong><em>a lot<\/em><\/strong> of processing, despite having only three color receptors we can <em>perceive<\/em> millions of colors (and shades/tones).

This mainly affects third codon positions, because, as you can see in the genetic code, this is where most codon families vary. It may happen that distant species share a same composition preference.

If we assume that for humans a generation is approximately 20 years, that means that there have been between seven and eight generations since 1859. That is nowehere near enough time to observe evolutionary changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in answer to your question, not very different at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <\/p>\n\n<p>I think I need to clarify my answer. When we talk about a species evolving or a species being different today than it was X years ago, we are referring to the species as a whole. Of course evolution is an ongoing process, selective pressures are shaping our gene pool constantly. However, in order to say that humans are different today to those of 1859, we would need to show that the prevalence of particular genotypes has changed. That a specific trait (a gene or a mutation in a gene) has become \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_%28population_genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">fixed<\/a>\", or, at the very least, that it has spread to a significant percentage of the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>@niallhaslam's answer gives a link to a wired.com article about genetic resistance to HIV. This is not something that has recently evolved in response to HIV but is the result of an ancestral mutation. The article itself states that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Using formulas that estimate how long genetic mutations have been\n  around, researchers have discovered that the mutation dates to the\n  Middle Ages. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Granted, this could be a good example of selection in action. If, after <em>many<\/em>, <em>many<\/em> more generations, this mutation has spread to the majority, or a significant percentage, of the population, we could point to it as an example of how humans have changed under the selective pressure of HIV infection. In order for this to happen, HIV will have to become common enough that having a resistance to is beneficial to a very large subset of humanity. I would expect to see such selective pressure in, for example, countries like South Africa where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa\" rel=\"nofollow\">12% of the population<\/a> is HIV positive. Such pressure, however, will be negligible in countries with lower infection rates. In the US, for example, <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0017502\" rel=\"nofollow\">a recent study<\/a> found HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older to be 42,200\u201354,000. Since the US has ~312 million people, 54,000 represents ~0.02% of the population. This will not provide enough of a selective pressure to observe differences in the <em>short term<\/em> evolutionary scale. <\/p>\n\n<p>We do not, in fact, \"evolve quickly in response to parasites viruses etc\". Pathogens may apply selective pressure yes. But this is not a quick process. In any case, we do not evolve <em>in response<\/em> to them. Mutations occur, randomly usually, and if they confer an advantage they may be selected for. Said advantage may be because they confer resistance to disease but even then, the original mutation was not \"in response\" to the pathogen, However, such selection happens over many successive generations and will spread relatively slowly (quickly by evolutionary standards perhaps, but still slow for us, and certainly slower than 7 generations) across the population. The same holds true of epigenetic changes. Even if they can (as now seems likely) be transmitted down the generations, any selective advantage they confer will still act at the generational level.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, while we are, of course, constantly evolving, there are no significant differences between the humans of today and those of Darwin's times. Sure, some genotypes may exist today that did not then and vice versa. These, however, are not representative of the species' genome. They may become so after many generations but, even if they exist, they have not had time to propagate through the gene pool and cannot be taken as evidence that <em>H. sapiens<\/em> as a species is \"different\" today.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3773,"question_id":3771,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1349352641},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/870fa1db677b2d36510cba57e4d4fd26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":476,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/476/niallhaslam","reputation":580,"display_name":"niallhaslam"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35114dfb827dc71cb3a8ff281617c5b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/535/larry-parnell","reputation":3430,"display_name":"Larry_Parnell"},"score":0,"post_id":3774,"edited":false,"creation_date":1349288793,"comment_id":5725,"body":"Yes, the epigenetic, or Lamarckian, response is important +1.

The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745839/\" rel=\"nofollow\">grandmother effect<\/a>, which is one of the main theories for human longevity after fertility might indicate that human lifespan would increase if the children come later.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just have to disclaim here: We will never do this.  Many unthinkable consequences would result...<\/p>\n\n<p>If you simply forbid anyone to have children before they are 40 or 45 (fertility doesn't drop until age 35 or so), forbid invitro fertilization and medical assistance to conception we would probably be looking at a prolonged lifespan.  Infertility rates in women at age 40 are not clear, but one estimate is that <a href=\"http://www.babycentre.co.uk/preconception/activelytrying/ageandfertility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">40% of women can have children at 40 years of age<\/a>.  If we want to seen an effect early, we would push the age up a year or two.  Forbidding in vitro fertilization and other medical assistance to offspring we could look like a 80-90% cut of people - lots of people would never have children.  This might make people unhappy an destabilize the social fabric.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its not clear how long this would take.  The generation time would go to 40 years from about 20 now - 40 to get to childbearing age, but results would take 80 years - when we find out how the children would fare.  Given the C elegans longevity experiments and the fact that we are starting with 8 billion people, we probably would find some great late age breeders who may also live long.  But for the longevity phenotype to set in it would take several generations as we are looking for an indirect effect: later breeding causing longevity.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox\" rel=\"nofollow\">Belyaev experiments<\/a> which produced domesticated foxes by strong selective breeding took some 30ish generations to complete though <a href=\"http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/ccgr/behaviour/History.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">they saw a significant effect in just 10<\/a>.  It could take a similar numbers of selection rounds in this cse.  4-500 years. Ethical issues aside, this is why most geneticists study flies.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There would also be a lot of other negative socioeconomic consequences to this thought experiment.  One good thing is that the population of the earth would plummet - many people would be eliminated from the gene pool, though eldercare would be a major part of the world workforce.  Lots of work, not clear who is going to pay for it, but low unemployment and low low wages may result.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XASqN.jpg\" alt=\"Why do I feel like this guy?\"> \nSo you see Mister President, this is quite a distinct possibility, though some sacrifices would have to be made. <\/p>\n\n<p>The science of human eugenics is not scientifically wrong, but selective animal breeding and lab experiments don't usually evaluate or care about the consequences of large peturbations in the gene pool. <\/p>\n\n<p>You would also have a lot more autism and Downs syndrome and other congenital defects which tend to show up in offspring of older parents. These issues might improve with application of biotechnology which screens weak sperm and eggs without ruining the effect you are looking for, maybe not.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Since we are selecting <em>against<\/em> fecundity, the human race could be dogged by fertility problems or chronic genetic diseases which the genetic contribution of some of the more robust people in the gene pool being removed and the tendency to such age-related birth defects might not go away given the drastic selection pressure we are putting on the gene pool. <\/p>\n\n<p>Other consequences you might not expect; some physical traits associated with longevity and prolonged fertility would cause us to look more alike and not necessarily in a good way.   <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_19964_5-scientific-reasons-youre-better-off-being-unattractive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Browse the internet<\/a>; its probable that we would get shorter and possibly uglier?  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many more direct ways to increase the human lifespan - better diet, exercise, the elimination of poverty, vaccinations, proper medical care, access to clean drinking water and a lower birth rate (fewer children not later) all are known to directly effect longevity, having more than doubled the human life expectancy in the past few hundred years. <\/p>\n","answer_id":3759,"question_id":3758,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1349292235}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3758/is-it-possible-to-increase-lifespan-through-controlled-evolution","last_activity_date":1349292235,"creation_date":1349234443,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is it possible to increase lifespan through controlled evolution?","body":"<p>A few years back when I was reading The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, there's this short passage where he theorizes about a way to achieve an increased lifespan through controlled evolution.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The theory goes like this: we don't tend to have medical problems until after 30 because we all tend to reproduce before that age.

The main difference is one of computational time. Blast is optimized for large databases. <\/p>\n\n<p>You are also likely to get different hits. Blast's e-value is calculated based on the size of the database, among other parameters. Roughly, the e-value answers the question: \"How many high scoring sequence pairs with X% of sequence identity and Y length would I expect to find in a database of size X by chance?\". Your e-values could be artificially high if you use the protein sequences as a database. I am not sure about this, but there may also be differences in the way gap penalties are dealt with by tblastn and blastx. <\/p>\n\n<p>That said, I would first try doing this using a tool specifically designed for the task. BLAST has no model for dealing with splicing and it is a pain to build gene models from BLAST results.

The muscles, again, by design are very badly adapted for isotonic action. That basically means they cannot keep the same pressure for long time and the only way to get a fix posture for the whole body is to keep sending repetitive pulses to antagonistic muscles so that none of them actually wins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Normally the impulses are very short and frequent. They also have to come synchronously and out-of-phase, meaning that whenever one muscles contracts its antagonist should dilate and vise versa, so that no muscle rupture takes place because of the simultaneous contraction of two opposite muscles. This synchrony accounts for very subtle trembling of the body, almost not seen by a naked eye in healthy humans. This trembling is also called <strong>physiological tremor<\/strong> to designate its being normal, e.g. physiological.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two ways how this trembling can increase so that it becomes visible and sensible:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Due to impaired synchronisation between the pulses sent to the antagonistic muscles.<\/strong> Since these pulses are generated in brainstem nervous centers, the impairment of those (in case of Parkinson's desease) or some inhibiting input into them (as in case of cerebellar deseases) leads to desync of these pulses, the frequency goes down whereas the amplitude might increase, making the trembling visible.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Due to attenuated cell sensitivity to the incoming impulses<\/strong>. This happens if the muscle cells start to overreact to the normal impulses and respond with prolonged contraction (followed by longer refractory period when they are unable to respond any impulse, thereby missing frequent pulses and reducing the effective frequency). These is mainly caused due to special metabolic changes within and in the vicinity of the muscle cells. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The most common metabolic change within the cell is either the increased Calcium concentration within muscle cells, leading to much stronger contraction, or increased sensitivity for Calcium (via Ca and ryanodin receptors), that leads to much abrupter Calcium concentration rise in cells and results in the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason for Ca to increase within the cells might be the intake of some known Calcium liberators, like caffein, increased concentration of the humoral factors that use Ca as second messenger, like adrenaline, insuline, thyroid factors etc. Those, again, can be released during some stress conditions, during artificial or temporal low sugar level and other factors. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shivering as a reaction to stress.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The shivering, or in medical terms <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor\">tremor<\/a> might appear due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28biological%29\">the following mechanisms<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Massive release of adrenaline during the stress: both directly via the adrenaline receptors and indirectly by causing temporal hyperglycemia via the metabolic adrenaline receptors. The action of adrenaline is also increased due to concomitant release of corticosteroids.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>(muss less probable in case of fright, however might be common in many other cases) Overlast of the hypothalamic/amygdalic/brainstem structures responsible for stress reaction with probable weakening of deep nuclei controls over the posture and muscle contraction.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So, as you see, the tremor is rather a pathophysiological reaction when it appears as response to stress, a side-effect manifestation due to acute temporal increase in adrenaline concentration in blood. Funny enough, but exactly this tremor is referenced to as \"physiological tremor\" in medical literature, because this type of tremor is not indicative for any CNS or endocrine disorder, that is very common for other types of tremor (postural, intentional etc.).<\/p>\n","answer_id":368,"question_id":363,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1325106935}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/363/is-trembling-an-advantageous-response-during-periods-of-anxiety","last_activity_date":1349217615,"creation_date":1325000823,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is trembling an advantageous response during periods of anxiety?","body":"<p>I originally had planned to ask about whether there was any biological truth in the popular phrase \"shivering with fright\".

This is often, but not necessarily, the selectable marker. So for example a YIp carrying the <em>URA3<\/em> gene as its only yeast DNA will integrate at the <em>URA3<\/em> locus (probably mutant to allow selection for Ura<sup>+<\/sup>, so more correctly <em>ura3<\/em>). <\/p>\n\n<p>If the YIp is linearised by cutting at a site within the <em>URA3<\/em> marker this will direct insertion and will increase the transformation efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once insertion has taken place, the configuration at the integration site is:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>chromosome...URA3...other YIp sequences...ura3...chromosome<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is inherently unstable because a looping-out event can take place <em>via<\/em> recombination between the <em>URA3/ura3<\/em> regions. So removing selection means that you run the risk of losing the insert. Furthermore, it is possible for looping out to occur leaving the <em>URA3<\/em> allele behind instead of the <em>ura3<\/em> allele. So you can lose the vector even when selection is maintained (but this will depend on the exact nature of the mutation).<\/p>\n\n<p>More complex configurations are possible where the targetting sequence is separate from the selectable marker, and where digestion removes a whole chunk of the targetting sequence before transformation. So for example if the <em>TRP1<\/em> gene was used for targetting a plasmid with the <em>URA3<\/em> marker in a <em>TRP1 ura3<\/em> strain you would get:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>chromosome...TRP1 fragment A...URA3+other YIp sequences...TRP1 fragment B...chromosome<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>the resulting transformant is now Ura<sup>+<\/sup> because of the integrated <em>URA3<\/em> plasmid, but some <em>TRP1<\/em> DNA is now missing (the DNA that was excised when the plasmid was digested) so the strain is <em>trp1<\/em>. The appearance of this Trp<sup>-<\/sup> phenotype indicates that the transformation has probably occurred by the pathway described.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case the inserted plasmid is much more stable because those two remaining fragments of <em>TRP1<\/em> DNA are not identical, so there is no possibility of looping out. <\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, if your transformant has the insert carrying the \"new gene\" flanked by a repeating sequence then it is unstable, otherwise it is ok to remove selection. In the first case, if the new gene is at all deleterious then there will be a strong selective pressure in favour of cells which have lost the insert. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can avoid using YIp plasmids altogether by integrating your new gene at any locus using long targetting primers, as shown in the Figure below. <\/p>\n\n<p>Design primers to amplify your gene as usual, but synthesise them with 40 bp 5' extensions corresponding to two sequences at the extreme ends of the integration site (<em>URA3<\/em> used here for illustration purposes). The resulting fragment can then be used in a transformation and will integrate at the <em>URA3<\/em> site by homologous recombination, replacing the resident DNA. The advantage of using <em>URA3<\/em> for this is that you can select for integrants as Ura<sup>-<\/sup> cells by resistance to fluoorotic acid (FOA). Although you can probably select directly for this, I have always co-transformed the fragment together with another selectable plasmid (<em>LEU2<\/em>, <em>TRP1<\/em> etc., but not a CEN plasmid) Then your e.g. Leu<sup>+<\/sup> transformants can be screened for those that have also become FOA<sup>R<\/sup>. This co-transformation happens at quite high frequency because the cells that do take up DNA take up a lot of it. Once you remove selection for the co-transforming plasmid it will soon get lost, leaving you with a clean non-reverting integrant.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's been a while since I did this sort of thing - probably there are even smarter methods around now.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/avG9U.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":3724,"question_id":3721,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1349028649},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff49f35d2cfb3501503c9a99459e4caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1450,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1450/lo-sauer","reputation":720,"display_name":"Lo Sauer","accept_rate":0},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":3725,"edited":false,"creation_date":1349019111,"comment_id":5654,"body":"Thanks @LoSauer This was helpful so I&#39;m upvoting though Alan&#39;s response is a little more detailed for the &#39;official&#39; answer."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1349001798,"creation_date":1349001798,"body":"<p>Yeast integrating plasmids are known to be stable, even in absence of a selective medium but can revert like most homologous recombination plasmids. <\/p>\n\n<p>Quoting from the book <em>Yeast Gene Analysis (pg476)<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>YIps are generally more stable than YRp or YEp plasmids.

If we include the lubrication in all of the surfaces which interact with light, our list would look like this:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lubrication<\/li>\n<li>Conjuctiva<\/li>\n<li>Cornea<\/li>\n<li>Anterior aqueous humour<\/li>\n<li>Iris<\/li>\n<li>Posterior aqueous humour<\/li>\n<li>Lens<\/li>\n<li>Vitreous humour<\/li>\n<li>Retina<\/li>\n<li>Fovea<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Out of that list, the <em>Iris<\/em>, <em>Retina<\/em>, and <em>Fovea<\/em> are designed to absorb light; not reflect it. The <em>Vitreous humour<\/em> merely serves as a medium for light to pass through and probably would not reflect light on its own. The same is true of both aqueous humours - they do not modify the light so much as serve the eye structurally.<\/p>\n\n<p>That leaves us with the Lubrication, Conjuctiva, Cornea, and Lens - surfaces which also interact with light, but act to some extent to reflect or modify it as well. The <strong>Cornea<\/strong> is what's actually operated on when a person undergoes corrective surgery; a pattern is etched into the Cornea which redirects light similar to the person's previous prescription and giving them better vision.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, because you mention the difference between an excited person and presumably someone at their normal state, it's worth to note (when dealing specifically with the eye) a very common side-effect of psycho-active drugs and emotional states (particularly fear and interest/curiosity) is the change in pupil size when lighting conditions don't change:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQWtP.jpg\" alt=\"Difference in pupil sizes.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The reflection is different depending on the size of the pupil, and I would venture to guess the pupil size difference between someone who's excited or manic (whose system is flooded with endorphins) and the person at normality is part of what you define as 'gleam.'<\/p>\n\n<p>The other situation you draw a difference between is a dead person vs. a living person. Before <em>rigor mortis<\/em> sets in, the relaxed state of the <strong>ciliary body<\/strong> is to stress the <strong>suspensory ligaments<\/strong> - resulting in pupil dilation. In addition, and I think this is the most important distinction: <em>dead people don't blink.<\/em> The act of blinking spreads the <strong>lubrication<\/strong> on the surface of the conjuctiva, and can be mimicked with tear-drops for people with dry eyes.

The internal structure of\n  connective tissues is an extracellular matrix.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Lastly,in chemistry, <code>matrix<\/code> generally refers to any chemical species which is not of direct immediate regard to the context of the observer (e.g. a chemist), but may or may not have significant effect on the chemistry or chemical environment in question.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Do the cellular organelles directly contribute to the tissue and organ's function?<\/strong> <br><\/p>\n\n<p>No, they do not <em>directly<\/em> contribute to the tissue and organ's function but organelles contribute <a href=\"http://universe-review.ca/F02-cosmicbg.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">indirectly<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a <a href=\"http://www.isss.org/hierarchy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">hierarchy<\/a> of structure: Everything is composed of smaller\n  things and is a part of something larger.

Hogan).<\/p>\n\n<p>Mathematically the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">matter of hierarchies<\/a> in science is tractable through <code>renormalization<\/code>.

The reason is that the organelles are enclosed by the cell and as such all prerequisites for sourcing energy are \"enclosed by one additional level\" as well. That being said, the organelles must maintain themselves, structurally (referred to as <code>turnover<\/code>) and information-wise. Information may not always be as accessible as through a designated external information carrier molecule, but may be a molecules properties or even another's  molecules properties, serving for instance as a \"nucleation template\". <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the word <code>just<\/code> in your question is not applicable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I would like to give you a few pointers related to cellularity and the question of \"why\" in a context of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cellularity<\/strong> may be a universal restriction that follows from the laws of thermodynamics. These laws are by consensus equally valid anywhere in the physically tractable universe.<br> To do any work you need to have a gradient of a physical property, which is relatable to an interconvertable form of energy. To do work in an open environment in a sustainable manner over a long-term period, it is good to have insulation. <\/p>\n\n<p>On this planet, inhabited by carbon-based lifeforms with evolution being confined to immediate (geo)chemistry**, that meant the use of lipids. Conveniently, lipids form micelles through intermolecular self-organization, in order to allow the system to reach a mimimum free energy state.<br>\nChemical systems with say ions too spontanously assemble given favorable energetic conditions,- all you have to do is let table-salt water evaporate, yielding you little salt-cubes which even shed a bit of insight into the underlying makeup of the crystal's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">unit cell<\/a>. But the energies of bonds that make up the insulation layer must be in a reasonable vicinity of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_%28energy%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">local thermal energy<\/a> (<code>k*T<\/code>), where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature in Kelvin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, chemical species where the weak London forces outweigh any other intermolecular forces, is ideal for self-assembly of an insulation layer in a biological context. It is not the only solution that evolved. But the insulation layer crucially determines your abilities and interactions as an unicellular or multicellular organism in the tempo-spatial regime. (How large can you get? How fast can you hunt? How fast can you bud something off or engulf? How flexible are you towards shifts in your environment? Those things...)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCB9IL8cEPo\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/r3G3s.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a>\n<br>(Dileptus - a predatory protozoan - hunting, hiding, and playing around)<\/p>\n\n<p>Self-organization can be observed across many hierarchies, serving the minimization (or optimization) of one or several properties.<br><\/p>\n\n<p>A lipid membrane is ideal on a planet whose surface is covered by an extremely polar molecule. Insulation-wise lipids are impermeable to ions to allow the formation of an membrane potential. As electrical insulators lipids are excellent thermal insulators, locally confining electrons, and finally at providing mechanical insulation. Additionally lipids can serve as fuel, nutrients, signalling molecules, and many other tasks - which really just follows from or less local <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">molecular evolution<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Evolution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Speaking of <strong>evolution<\/strong>. Just like biology doesn't make sense without the context of evolution, evolution doesn't make sense without the context of energy.  For science, evolution starts at the earliest physically tractable point and transitions across many hierarchies. Matter itself is just another form of energy, and as poorly defined as space: as \"<code>anything that has mass and takes up space<\/code>\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Concluding:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>No-one can conclusively tell you what any given organelle is for (yet). <\/p>\n\n<p>But science has furnished a comprehensive picture, by looking at the molecules that make up the organelle and tracing it back to genes to let scientists marvel at an organelles function from a bioinformatical perspective. What greatly helps the exploration of organelle function are many high-resolving imaging techniques, with a plethora of labeling techniques. This array of labeling methods was amassed over the course of a century. Recently imaging equipment has seen a rapid increase of better resolutions in the time domain, which is very important as each level of hierarchy has its own sort of \"time-signature\" - which is of course strongly influence by the masses (or inertial forces) involved.<\/p>\n\n<p>The entire picture of organelle function is however subject to a major revision-cycle with the ongoing efforts to map out entire cells at an atomic level, with large scale preparations already underway.<\/p>\n\n<p>This post isn't thoroughly sourced, and much of it is only a layman's perspective.

Does this qualify as retaining and planning? I don't know. Cells also change based on environmental pressures through stochastic processes (a process known as evolution).

The point I am making here is that each point on that scale (and every point in between that we haven't explicitly assigned a word to) will represent a slightly different mix of various chemical signals in your body. <\/p>\n\n<p>If your question is more about the English language words love and infatuation, their definition and distinguishing between them, try posting on <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/\">English.SE<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3626,"question_id":3491,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1348404566},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/222b478bab6d59dc5de514a87dba88cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":389,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/389/bobthejoe","reputation":4911,"display_name":"bobthejoe","accept_rate":53},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1348442144,"creation_date":1348442144,"body":"<p>Using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triarchic Theory of Love<\/a> proposed by Robert Sternberg, love is divided into three components:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Intimacy<\/li>\n<li>Passion<\/li>\n<li>Commitment<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Using the theory's particular <em>Infatuation<\/em> is just the passion portion of love which is lacking in intimacy and commitment required for <em>Consummate Love<\/em> or True Love.<\/p>\n\n<p>Physiologically speaking, this is when a certain sense of dependency comes in and as we know from years of addiction research, there is a physiological difference between liking sex physically and liking sex with a particular person for non-physical reasons.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3656,"question_id":3491,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3491/is-there-a-physiological-difference-between-love-and-infatuation","last_activity_date":1348442144,"creation_date":1347204045,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is there a physiological difference between love and infatuation?","body":"<p>I find that people generally distinguish between love and infatuation.
