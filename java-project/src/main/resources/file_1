Potassium is a calcium inhibitor, so as the potassium flows out of the cell, it eventually reduces the presence of calcium. This causes the closure of the Na-K channel (negative feedback mechanism). In a hypokalemic state, the lack of sufficient K doesn't inhibit the calcium channel, and in turn doesn't properly terminate the muscle contraction at the cellular level. <\/p>\n\n<p>The continued presence of calcium, which has a lot to do with nerve impulses, means that the nerves keep firing, and in some cases such as a 'charlie horse', these impulses fire fast and continuously. The body at this point is reaching a small local state of metabolic acidosis resulting from the extremely high oxygen consumption, increasing levels of CO\u2082 (the acidosis component) and reducing blood partial oxygen levels. Since the oxygen is no longer as abundant as it was, it inhibits the bodies ability to locally produce the ribose and phosphate necessary for ATP.

The action potential moves down motor neuron and reached the terminal bouton. At the terminal bouton, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine travels through myoneural junction and into myoneural cleft. ACH binds to the receptor which causes an action potential in both directions along the cell membrane. \n    Action potential repels potassium which travels down cell membrane until it falls into a transverse tubule. K+ continues to fall into transverse tubule and accumulates which increases voltage (-70 to -50 mV). The voltage change causes the calcium gates to open and calcium diffuses out. \n    Calcium then binds to troponin. Troponin binds to tropomyosin and pulls it exposing the g-actin binding site which allows myosin and actin to bind. the myosin head changes shape (called power or working stroke) and pulls the actin towards the M line and the muscle contracts. similar to Tug-of-War, the myosin heads (your hands) pull on the actin (the rope) to contract a muscle. like team members for tug of war, the myosin heads alternate between pulling and holding on to the actin... the only way myosin will release actin is to add ATP which forces the two apart and thus relaxing the muscle. (as mentioned above).. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now a lack of potassium, sodium, or calcium would prevent the muscle from contracting but wont relieve a muscle cramp. the common advice of eating a banana actually does help relieve cramps but not because of the potassium.

As a result, since there are an unequal distribution of sodium to potassium, less potassium is flowing out the membrane while more sodium will flow in the membrane causing it to depolarize faster than it suppose to repolarize. since the inside of the cell is becoming more positive with the help of sodium and the outside of the cell is becoming negative with the help of potassium, the inside of the cell is pulling back the potassium. but again, there is an unequal distribution of potassium compare to sodium so it will never achieve that electrochemical equilubrium (resting membrane potential). since electrochemical equilibrium can not be achieve, sodium is flowing inside the membrane causing it depolarize across the membrane at a rapid rate forming an unfused tentanus at a rapid rate. <\/p>\n\n<p>the rate in which this is happening is so fast that it wont let the myosin head detach from actin for a long period of time, so it continuously making the sacromere shorter and shorter causing a pain receptor to travel toward the CNS. these is my hypothesis. <\/p>\n","answer_id":15162,"question_id":7847,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1392854679},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ed8847aca96b12eb0a7e0cfa554d53e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5792,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5792/user5792","reputation":11,"display_name":"user5792"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1392856010,"creation_date":1392856010,"body":"<p>One of the thing i would like to point out is that ATP detached the myosin head but does not control the powerstroke!

This pore allows the influx of both sodium and calcium ions which induce depolarisation (a positive shift in the membrane voltage) to trigger the voltage-dependent ion channels responsible for action potentials.\nA reduction in sodium ions would mean more calcium is able to enter the cell through the nAChR. The calcium ion carries greater charge as it is formed by the loss of two electrons from it's outer shell whilst the sodium ion is form by the loss of one electron.

Gram staining is a common technique used to differentiate two large groups of bacteria based on their different cell wall constituents. The Gram stain procedure distinguishes between <strong>Gram<sup>+<\/sup><\/strong> and <strong>Gram<sup>-<\/sup><\/strong> groups by coloring these cells violet or red, respectively (Fig. 1). <\/p>\n\n<p>Gram<sup>+<\/sup> bacteria stain violet due to the presence of a thick layer of <strong><a href=\"http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/glycobiology/peptidoglycans.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">peptidoglycan<\/a><\/strong> in their <strong><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v13/n10/fig_tab/nrmicro3480_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cell wall<\/a><\/strong>, which retains the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet\" rel=\"nofollow\">crystal violet<\/a> these cells are stained with. Gram<sup>-<\/sup>, on the other hand stain red, which is attributed to a thinner peptidoglycan wall, which does not retain the crystal violet during the decoloring process.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/research_methods/microscopy/gramstain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gram staining procedure<\/a><\/strong><br>\nThe procedure involves staining the cells with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet\" rel=\"nofollow\">crystal violet<\/a> dye. Next, an iodine solution (iodine and potassium iodide) is added to form a complex between the crystal violet and iodine, which is insoluble in water. Then, a decolorizer, such as ethyl alcohol, is added to the sample, which dehydrates the peptidoglycan layer, shrinking and tightening it. The crystal violet-iodine complex is not able to penetrate this tightened peptidoglycan layer, and is thus trapped in the cell in Gram<sup>+<\/sup> bacteria. In Gram<sup>-<\/sup> bacteria, however, the thinner peptidoglycan layer does not retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and the color is lost. Lastly, a counterstain, such as the weakly water soluble safranin, is added to the sample, staining it red. Since the safranin is lighter of color than crystal violet, it does not disrupt the purple coloration in Gram<sup>+<\/sup> cells, but it does stain the decolorized Gram<sup>-<\/sup> cells red.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jrv3w.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jrv3w.png\" alt=\"Gram + and -\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

Much more is known about the mechanisms causing thirst, and the mechanisms of return to normal serum osmolality over 120-180 minutes after rehydration than those <em>immediately<\/em> satisfying it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the research on this is old (pre-2000).

The third group was given fluid by ng tube only.<\/p>\n\n<p>The very act of swallowing fluid boluses induced satiety. However, plasma arginine vasopressin levels (involved in the regulation of fluid intake) dropped rapidly during the first 5 minutes of drinking in both <em>ad lib<\/em> groups, but not in those given fluids via ng tube, so it is not only mechanical receptors that are involved in quenching of thirst.<\/p>\n\n<p>This confirmed an older study which demonstrated the importance of the rapid drop in plasma vasopressin in hydration before major changes in plasma osmolality occurred.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Given the lack of extensive research and the relative immediacy of thirst suppression, The most likely explanation is a combination of sensory modalities and reflexes (mucosal wetness, temperature of rehydration fluid, mechanicoreceptors in the oropharynx, esophagus, etc.), and some rapid hormonal changes - e.g. in AVP - are responsible for limiting the amount we drink when thirsty.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>1 <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13991252_Regulation_of_fluid_intake_in_dehydrated_humans_Role_of_oropharyngeal_stimulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regulation of fluid intake in dehydrated humans: Role of oropharyngeal stimulation<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>2 <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11818351_Influence_of_Age_on_Thirst_and_Fluid_Intake\" rel=\"nofollow\">Influence of age on thirst and fluid intake<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>3 <a href=\"http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/252/6/R1138.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acute suppression of plasma vasopressin and thirst after drinking in hypernatremic humans<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":45850,"question_id":45825,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45825/how-does-the-brain-immediately-know-when-ones-thirst-has-been-quenched","last_activity_date":1462311760,"creation_date":1462270276,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does the brain immediately know when one's thirst has been quenched?","body":"<p>The question struck me the other day when I drank a glass of water.

The best way I can answer is by highlighting what about cancer actually kills, from which you can personally evaluate if a particular type of cancer fits and would be lethal.<\/p>\n\n<p>You need to remember that it is not the metastization per se that kills something, it is the growth interfering with critical systems that causes death. Many systems in a body will prove lethal if sufficiently compromised. The brain is an obviously vulnerable point (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.temple.edu/science/article/pii/S030645220400418X\" rel=\"nofollow\">a sample of one of its mechanisms can be found here<\/a>), but even something like the lymphatic system, which is notably able to maintain its duties with some components compromised or removed, are ultimately necessary (a compromised lymphatic system will, among other things, leave one vulnerable to otherwise harmless infections). The primary checks to take away from this are \"Can a body survive with this system compromised, or to what degree?\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Even in the case of a hypothetical cancer that is not particularly metastatic, but simply growing in a particular area (we'll even be generous and say the particular area is not vital to survival), tumors take resources to maintain, both chemically and mechanically (pulmonary issues are known to occur with this sort of unguided growth). Many of these effects can be highlighted in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.temple.edu/doi/10.1002/ajmg.c.30063/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">overgrowth diseases such as in Proteus syndrome<\/a> (<strong>Note<\/strong> - My apologies, this is behind an academic paywall). Considerations for this part are \"How many resources can a body afford to lose?\" and \"Can the heart support this extra mass?\". <\/p>\n\n<p>As an additional factor, tumors that don't allow infiltration by cells from the immune system can be prone to infections, both internally and externally. This is circumstantial, though, and not a core component of a cancer's lethality (mostly).<\/p>\n\n<p>The mere presence of a tumor is <em>not<\/em> guarenteed to be lethal, but I would say, ultimately, any <em>continuously-growing<\/em> tumor will lead to death, simply by subverting the proper mechanisms of the body to a sufficient level. <\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.temple.edu/science/article/pii/S030645220400418X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Papadopoulous <em>et al<\/em>., Neuroscience (2004);129,1009\u20131018<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.temple.edu/doi/10.1002/ajmg.c.30063/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cohen, AJMG (2005);137C,38\u201352<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":45846,"question_id":45844,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1462310790}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45844/is-metastatic-cancer-always-lethal-if-uncured","last_activity_date":1462310790,"creation_date":1462303630,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is metastatic cancer always lethal if uncured?","body":"<p>Can matastases spread in different parts of the body of an animal suffering from cancer grow in a limited way, such as not to cause much more harm that a benignant tumor in those parts of the body would, or are metastases guaranteed to eventually cause death, if left uncured?<\/p>\n","question_id":45844,"tags":["cell-biology","cancer"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b3361c1927c264c77db5a9f4e054129?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4796,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4796/user4796","reputation":11,"display_name":"user4796"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqkqP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4101/amory","reputation":7383,"display_name":"Amory"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1383240429,"creation_date":1383240429,"body":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00657119\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sockeye salmon<\/a> species <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00612020\" rel=\"nofollow\">definitely<\/a> do, although admittedly the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614721/\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting salmon<\/a> are those that spend significant time in the ocean.<\/li>\n<li>Here's some evidence that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3515494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">carp can<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/29/1205653109\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raindbow trout<\/a> are also <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19669766\" rel=\"nofollow\">capable<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121011/srep00727/full/srep00727.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zebrafish<\/a> are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753024\" rel=\"nofollow\">also able<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15277551\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japanese eels<\/a> too, of which some are freshwater. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":11201,"question_id":11199,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11199/what-freshwater-fish-are-affected-by-magnetic-fields","last_activity_date":1462308914,"creation_date":1383238357,"answer_count":1,"title":"What Freshwater Fish Are Affected By Magnetic Fields","body":"<p>I am interested in knowing which freshwater fish are affected by magnetic fields.

Additionally removing Eumelanin from your skin will lead to a higher risk for skin cancers as Melanoma. Let's think through this:<\/p>\n\n<p>If we look at the biosynthesis pathway of the Melanins, they both start with the same two reactions (see the figure from <a href=\"https://www.adapaproject.org/doggenetics/tiki-index.php?page=Gene%20and%20Allele%20Summary%3A%20Coat%20Colors\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>): <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h5scW.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h5scW.gif\" alt=\"Melanin biosynthesis pathway\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The routs parts at the DOPAquinone, which in the presence of Gluthathione or Cysteine goes into the pheomelanin direction. The concentration of Cysteine available to the cell needs to be higher than 0,76 ¬µM (see references 2 and 3 for details), otherwise the reaction goes exclusively into the Eumelanin direction.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some skin whitening (or better lightening) products available which contain L-Cysteine or GSH. This will work to some extend, but once the level drops enough, the ratio will shift back to the more natural ratio between Eumelanin and Pheomelanin. There is also no data available on the risks of doing this, so I would strongly advocate against it. See the review in reference 4 for details and additional references on this topic.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you now think, ok, taking some pills is enough, I would call this a false hope, since this process is highly regulated. This happens on one part through external signaling through the MC1R receptor (which as you already mentioned is of importance here) and also through the availability of key enzymes in the process as well as stability of them and their regulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Signaling through the MC1R receptor is highly important for pigmentation and also the amount of enzymes available (the transcription factor MITF is regulated by it). If the signaling is strong, the cysteine storage is soon depleted bringing on the production of Eumelanin. If this signaling is weak \nthis will not happen and the production of pheomelanin is favoured. Mutations in MC1R are the reason for people having red hair and and fair skin. See reference 5 and 6. <\/p>\n\n<p>Interfering with the signaling cascade which is activated by MC1R is certainly not a good idea either, since this will interfere with other processes in the cell as well. These pathways are also disregulated in cancers, so I would not touch these.<\/p>\n\n<p>Summarizing I think there will only be a way of influencing this by taking some supplements, but how safe this is, is unknown. All the other possible ways are certainly more dangerous.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23650156\" rel=\"nofollow\">How does pheomelanin synthesis contribute to melanomagenesis?: Two\ndistinct mechanisms could explain the carcinogenicity of pheomelanin\nsynthesis.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12950725\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rate constants for the first two chemical steps of eumelanogenesis.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18435614\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry of mixed melanogenesis--pivotal roles of dopaquinone.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=6;spage=842;epage=846;aulast=Malathi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Systemic skin whitening/lightening agents: What is the evidence?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102648/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UV signaling pathways within the skin<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sci-hub.io/10.1001/archderm.137.11.1477\" rel=\"nofollow\">The melanocortin-1 receptor: red hair and beyond.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":42945,"question_id":42944,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42944/how-to-increase-pheomelanin-production","last_activity_date":1462222512,"creation_date":1454440125,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to increase pheomelanin production?","body":"<p>How can you increase the pheomelanin production in your body, while decreasing the eumelanin production?

However, in diploid organisms the other fully-functional copy of the gene can compensate for the non-functional allele. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes both the alleles can carry different mutations which can lead to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementation_%28genetics%29\">complementation<\/a>; this would not affect the gene activity. Also see:  <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/42904/3340\">Explain allelic complementation at molecular level<\/a>. Let's not consider this case here. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, the fitness of the heterozygotes would not be affected and they will continue to propagate. However, if both the alleles are affected then it would lead to lethality (or lets say reduced fitness). This can happen if two heterozygotes (with the same deleterious mutation) mate and give rise to a homozygote (with both the alleles affected). Since siblings (or other close kins) are genetically related, there is a good likelihood that both of them may be carrying a copy of a non-functional allele and homozygous offspring born out of such a mating may have reduced fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominant lethal genes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are some cases of dominant lethal alleles. Examples include the mutated genes responsible for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington&#39;s_disease\">Huntington's disease<\/a> (or similar <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinucleotide_repeat_disorder#Polyglutamine_.28PolyQ.29_Diseases\">poly-Q disorders<\/a>). Other examples include a mutant allele of a proto-oncogene that leads to its hyperactivity (and therefore cancer). <\/p>\n\n<p>Dominant lethal alleles persist in the population primarily because of their late onset. In such cases an individual with such an allele would have already mated and produced offspring before the disease kills them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other reasons for the persistence of lethal genes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Another possibility (applicable to the case of cancer) is that the mutations are not in the germ cells and were acquired by somatic cells because of some external agent. These mutations would not be transmitted to the next generation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the deleterious nature of the allele can exert its effect only under certain conditions. Let's say someone has a mutation that causes reduced immunity. Such a person would survive well if they remain in a sterile environment. In general, we can say that there is no strong selective pressure against the mutation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the reduced fitness because of a mutation under a certain condition can be overwhelmed by an increased fitness caused by it under some other condition. A very well known example is that of the haemoglobin allele that causes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\">sickle-cell anaemia<\/a>. However, the RBCs in the individuals affected by this disease are resistant to infection by the malarial parasite. The mortality due to malaria is much higher than that due to sickle cell anaemia. Therefore, in regions where malaria has high incidence (like Africa) this allele is positively selected. <\/p>\n","answer_id":45750,"question_id":45744,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1462025372},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27067cb8ac1714eba8360bb13805b9dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":23603,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23603/user23603","reputation":1,"display_name":"user23603"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/emgtc.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23592,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23592/darklightus","reputation":43,"display_name":"Darklightus"},"score":0,"post_id":45757,"edited":false,"creation_date":1462067323,"comment_id":80258,"body":"But there are so many species where these genes are not present that it seems unlikely to be such a big deal.

Except for a 25% chance of offspring not surviving, in the rare event that the other parent also has the mutation.<\/p>\n\n<p>That recessive, lethal genes can persist in the population is surprisingly one of the reasons that diploid organisms that sexually reproduce are so successful and diverse. Diploidy means there are two copies of each gene, and that a mutation in one gene that doesn't immediately increase fitness won't necessarily be removed from the population. Even if it would be down right fatal if it occurred in both genes. Because its function can often be covered by the other, normal gene.<\/p>\n\n<p>It might appear that a carrier of this mutated gene might be less fit to produce healthy offspring. But most organisms create many more offspring than can actually thrive. And what first appears to be a 'weak gene' can later go on to be the basis for a better mutation, often through recombination during meiosis of parts of the lethal gene with its normal counterpart.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general this is one of the reasons that eukaryotes are so diverse. Because they have many mechanisms like this that don't only protect from mistakes in DNA, they often enable them to be beneficial.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another such mechanism is that eukaryotes have a lot of introns in their DNA that are removed from their messenger RNA before it is translated into protein. This means that any random chunk of DNA integrating into their genome (a reasonably frequent event, evolutionarily speaking) is less likely to cause gene inactivation and more likely to simply be incorporated.

The problem is that lipids are not soluble in water (try to pour some oil in a glass of water) and blood is mainly composed of water. Lipoproteins, on the other hand, have a hydrophilic (=\"water-loving\") exterior and a lipophilic (=\"fat-loving\") interior, like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Chylomicron.svg/500px-Chylomicron.svg.png\" alt=\"Structure of a chylomicron - from Wikipedia\">  <\/p>\n\n<p>In the picture, the \"balls\" represent proteins, called apoproteins, and the C represent cholesterol and T tryglicerids, which are both lipids.\nAs you can see, all the fats are inside the lipoprotein, but the exterior, being soluble in water can be easily dissolved in the blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biochemistry of lipoproteins is quite involved and I will not go into details here (but please leave a comment if you want further explanations) but, to simplify things:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HDL bring lipids from the periphery back to the liver<\/li>\n<li>LDL bring lipids from the liver to the periphery<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It is very important, at this point, to note that lipids are a physiologically important part of our organisms.

In fact, <strong>cholesterol is extremely important for the correct functioning of the body<\/strong> as, for instance, it is used as the base to make many hormones (the so-called steroid hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, too high levels of lipids, particularly cholesterol, are not beneficial, as high cholesterol levels have been in fact linked to many cardiovascular diseases, which we hear a lot about these days.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, because HDL tend to remove the lipids from the circulation and bring them back to the liver they can be considered as some sort of \"cleaners\", that remove excess cholesterol from circulation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5154,"question_id":5152,"up_vote_count":12}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5152/what-is-are-the-molecular-differences-between-hdl-and-ldl-cholesterol","last_activity_date":1462003838,"creation_date":1352309310,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is/are the molecular differences between HDL and LDL cholesterol?","body":"<p>Why exactly is HDL-cholesterol good for us and LDL-cholesterol bad for us.

But mainstream media articles tend to glorify the actual reasons behind such decisions, because such questions are governed by much more complex ethical considerations.<\/p>\n\n<p>But moving on this recognised the need for targeted gene therapies, so one of the most promising techniques right now is the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n4/full/nbt.2842.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispr/Cas9<\/a> technique as noted by the comments above above. <\/p>\n\n<p>So do we have the technology? Yes we do.<\/p>\n\n<p>Should we go forward with it? <\/p>\n\n<p>I would say no. But, I would also say yes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why such a division in opinion?<\/p>\n\n<p>There is much that we do not understand. Until a few years ago, the non-coding part of the genome was just junk. Now, it's an essential regulatory partner. Even more recently, the understanding of chromosome architecture was not understood, now we know that Chromosome architecture has a role to play in gene expression. In 2002 epigenomics was in it's infancy, we believed \"central dogma\" to be a dogma, non-coding RNAs were just some junk that you tended to pick up because the transcription machinery did not know what it was doing, and chromosome architecture? that hardly mattered in the grander scheme of the cell. All in all the cell was a much simpler place. Now we know more than we did yesterday and less than we will know tomorrow, so if I was a person whose entire life is a prolonged episode of suffering I would take my current options. If I was a person who could live with a mild discomfort I would work around it.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":36609,"question_id":31222,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31222/swapping-genes","last_activity_date":1461990002,"creation_date":1428666547,"answer_count":3,"title":"Swapping genes?","body":"<p>So, gene therapy is to take out a gene, correct its mutation, and put the corrected one back into the organism, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is it also possible to take out a gene from an organism and put in a totally different one?<\/p>\n\n<p>I read about this study where a scientist found four genes seemingly responsible for creating high, medium, low pan sensitivities.\nGenes: COMT, DRD2, DRD1 and OPRK1.<\/p>\n\n<p>DRD1 - more common among people with low pain perception.<\/p>\n\n<p>COMT and OPRK genes were seen more, for those with moderate pain.<\/p>\n\n<p>DRD2 gene variant was more common among those with a high pain perception.<\/p>\n\n<p>So for example, can we take out a DRD2 gene from a person who has high pain sensitivity and put DRD1 in him/her so that he/she can have low pain sensitivity?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is that technically possible?<\/p>\n","question_id":31222,"tags":["genetics","human-genetics","pain"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":181,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1428684210},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550aa98332616362fa07d023da45d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":28,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/28/gergana-vandova","reputation":5081,"display_name":"Gergana Vandova","accept_rate":35},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9bd7c0a93e1587d390866d374842b91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9829,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9829/luigi","reputation":2475,"display_name":"Luigi"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1461989596,"creation_date":1461989596,"body":"<p>The best reference I could find is a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527634521.ch1/summary\" rel=\"nofollow\">book chapter<\/a> (<a href=\"http://www.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527327290_c01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">available here as a .pdf<\/a>) from a book on optimizing the expression of membrane proteins that argues for T7.

The R language is commonly used for statistical work, but Python (in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy\">SciPy stack<\/a>) and C++ also gets used a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before going further, I should point out you are asking two questions. One about computation and the other about presentation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Computation:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You mentioned R. That is a programming language (with specialized software built around it). When it comes to programming language choice, the three most important factors are personal preference, available libraries, and the language already in use if you are joining a project with a pre-existing code-base. You might notice performance is not on this short list. The reason for this is that modern languages on modern hardware are efficient enough to, very often, make language choice irrelevant from a performance perspective. Most computational tasks suitable for R are also suitable for languages like Python and Julia.<\/p>\n\n<p>R's strength is in its focus for statistical work. Whereas Python's standard library comes with many bells and whistles intended to ease the design of small to moderate sized pieces of software across many situations, R comes with many features focused specifically on easing the task of writing code for complicated statistical calculations. Due to it being so common in academia, R one language you are very likely to encounter in academic, computational work. That makes knowing it a helpful skill (whether you regularly use it or not). R, having such a strong suite of tools and large userbase, is also the basis for many third-party tools. One interesting example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioconductor\">Bioconductor<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, there are also advantages to using (or at least knowing) Python. It is one of the <a href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index\">most common languages<\/a> in programming in general. That means it has a diverse assortment of libraries designed for it by members of the community. When it comes to nonstatistical libraries, few languages have as many options. When it comes to statistical work, Python does not have as many options as R, but it does still have a lot. The SciPy stack, which includes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy\">NumPy<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_%28software%29\">Pandas<\/a> libraries, is a big part of that. Another benefit that comes from Python's popularity in the programming world is that you will have an easier time finding programmers to help you on a large project if you decide to look for help outside of your field. (For example, far more computer science majors will know Python than R ...multiple times over.)<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the Julia language goes, it is still new. It is being developed as a competitor to R and Python, but it is not mature enough to be a serious contender just yet. However, since your question is about what people use, I would be remiss to ignore it. It may become a serious contender, but for right now, it is still trying to grow and prove its worth.<\/p>\n\n<p>If performance becomes a serious issue, you would probably be forced to dump R, Python, or whatever very high level language you are using in favor of C or C++. Both are far more efficient than the so-called \"batteries included\" languages. C and C++ are <em>system<\/em> programming languages. They are often used in operating systems, databases, video games, and other large pieces of software which you would not want slowed down due to features being included which you did not explicitly program in. (C and C++ are also used in small projects, but I digress.) However, taking advantage of this efficiency requires some insight into how computers actually work. This is not a difficult task, and any good tutorial or book will cover such topics. Using C or C++ without this basic understanding will likely be counter productive, as doing so can lead to you inadvertently creating a program far slower than it needs to be, which could be an issue if performance is becoming a serious concern.<\/p>\n\n<p>A non-performance benefit of C is the large library selection. As I mentioned above, few languages can compare to Python's library selection. C is definitely one of those few. Actually, C is essentially the lingua franca of libraries (due to its age, its dominant position, and aforementioned efficiency). This means you might find yourself needing to use some highly specialized library with no bindings to languages like Python or R. I have come across a few.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>R is also a nice language for graphing data. It comes with a package known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggplot2\">ggplot2<\/a>, which is responsible for this functionality. This is a common source of data visualizations. However, this does not mean you must use R if you want to create graphs that follow the norms of academia. First off, many people use other pieces of software for plotting. Secondly, there is the library for Python called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib\">matplotlib<\/a>. It is fully featured and is capable imitating the visual appearance of ggplot. One of its built-in style sheets was included just for this purpose. Not surprisingly, matplotlib is the graphing library used in SciPy.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many other graphing/plotting libraries, and many of them are fairly language agnostic. Presentation is not often a deciding factor in what language to use for computation. However, if you found yourself needing to use a specific language for its presentation options, doing computations in one language and then feeding the results into another for presentation is not unheard of.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Software:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I include this as a third category because this is more complicated than deciding on <em>programming language A or B<\/em> or choosing a plotting utility. Non-computer scientists often confuse software with languages. You have to use software when writing a program in a give language, but all the work is done by the program you write. Large software suites, on the other hand, do work for you in many ways. They often come with some sort of quasi-programming language included, but that is only one part of a larger whole. While R comes with a number of software tools, Matlab and Mathematica are better example of this. Free, open source alternatives to these proprietary suites would be Octave and Scilab, although such open source software traditionally has not very competitive with the likes of Matlab. SciPy is a recent example of open source software closing the feature gap (which is a very good thing in terms of avoiding vendor lock).<\/p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, it is hard to say what you would encounter or what is common. Most large software tools are proprietary. Different companies, universities, and individual projects will use different software, and you will not know what to expect until you you are recruited by a team.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is why projects sticking to programming languages over large software is preferable in terms of ease of recruitment. Also, programming code can be published with papers a lot easier than describing how you used a piece of software (which is big if open data is important to you). That being said, it can not always be avoided. Many machines in biology require specialized software and many kinds of data are most easily manipulated with proprietary software. Do not worry about such situations. It, obviously, will not affect your current work from being presented in a standard way.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT:<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the wall of text.
