The loss (exchange) of heat between the body and external environment mainly occurs on the skin's surface. Hence, body volume determines <em>how much<\/em> heat is stored, while body surface determines <em>how fast<\/em> that heat is dissipated to the environment.

We often say regulation of expression of a gene but what expression ultimately leads to is the activity of the gene (whatever it might be: enzyme based catalysis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, response to an extracellular signal). Activity of course depends on the expression level of the gene but it also depends on other factors such as covalent modifications, interactions with other genes (like dimerization) etc. Moreover, for genes which code for proteins, expression also has two stages. <\/p>\n\n<p>Coming back to your question:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a gene is NOT a TF gene, can it regulate itself?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes it can.

This loop contains regulation by both post-translational modification and post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization. There are many other examples involving RBPs.

Otherwise we wouldn't be able to estimate the distance from flat objects, such as traffic signs and shooting targets.<\/p>\n\n<p>The actual mechanism is parallax estimation, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Binocular disparity<\/a>. In a nutshell, the closer an object is to your eyes, the bigger the difference of its position on the left and right eye's retina will be.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may perform a simple experiment: find a place where several parallel wires hang in the air: a train line or aerial phone/power line. Look at the wires normally, and they will appear just as black lines in the sky, with no distance perception. Now tilt your head to the side, and you will instantly gain a feeling which one is closer, and which one is further away. Why the difference? Because any shift of a horizontal wire gives the same picture, meanwhile for vertical wires the difference is obvious.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you close one eye, your brain loses the ability to estimate parallax. However, it is left with several options:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visual cues. If one object overlaps another, it's obviously closer. If two objects look the same but one is smaller, it's probably further away (or a child). If you know the expected size of an object (a mountain/a horse/a fly), you may get the feeling of distance as well. <\/li>\n<li>Focusing distance. When you focus your eye on a near and far object, the feelings are different.<\/li>\n<li>Memories. You remember what you've seen with two eyes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Of these, only (3) depends on previous binocular vision. (1) and (2) are available even to those who were born with one eye. However, parallax estimation is much more fast and precise.

For an overview of such classes of drugs, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy#Types\" rel=\"nofollow\">see the Wikipedia page on Chemotherapy<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Alkylating agents<\/strong> covalently modify the DNA (along with protein and RNA) of affected cells, causing misreading errors to accumulate as DNA is replicated. Alkylated DNA bases cause misincorporation of nucleotides on the newly synthesized strand that sometimes escape proofreading, causing mutations to be passed on to all daughter cells. Also, if such survailance systems are working in cancer cells, alkylated DNA can cause cell cycle arrest or even programmed cell death.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Antimetabolites<\/strong> disrupt necessary cellular metabolic functions. One common mechanism is to interfere with any chemical reactions catalyzed by the folate family of vitamins/enzymatic cofactors. Folate is necessary for synthesis of some new nucleotides, which are necessary for replicating the genome. A lack of these nucleotides can cause low-fidelity DNA replication (introducing deleterious mutations into the genomes the cells) and cell cycle arrest, blocking division and proliferation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Anti-microtubule agents<\/strong> interfere with the dynamic behavior of microtubules, a subcellular structure responsible for properly sorting the chromosomes during cell division; microtubules also contribute to cell shape and tissue-invasive locomotion. Preventing microtubules from functioning normally can lead to chromosomal missegregation during cell division, depriving some daughter cells of whole chromosomes (gene loss) and leading to genome instability, which can cause cells to loose fitness or loose genes necessary for life.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are some examples of chemotherapeutics that do not rely on broadly oxidative mechanisms for their cell-killing action. The point of chemotherapy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy#/media/File:Screenshot_at_2013-08-16_14_52_30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">is to be more toxic to malignant cells than to the rest of the body's cells<\/a>.

That is, when young embryos fuse together and create single one with two different cell-lines, which later differentiate to create different organs.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28genetics%29<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, rather more common but with less drastic effect can be somatic chimeras, that is when (usually) early, when embryo is formed only by small amount of cells, one of cell has a mutation, then later in life, this cell again can give rise to organ or several of them. In that case, those organs will carry this mutation while rest of the body will not. This can be potentially more common as this can happen in any single time during development and even after it (in fact, cancer cells are sort of product of that).\nMore interesting cases here:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28genetics%29<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So, from simple fact that these cases exists and are well-spread, and basically means that several different cell-lines can live in the same body, the answer on your question, if organ DNA will be replaced after transplantation is no.<\/p>\n\n<p>edit: In the case of whole cell replacement, they can be from both donor and host. However, there are a few problems:<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of cells that we have are not totipotent, not even pluripotent or multipotent (see: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_potency\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_potency<\/a>), most of our cells are plain and stupid. This means that highly specialized cells of some organ would probably be replaced only by other highly-specialized cells of that organ (or their precursor cells that are kept for this solo reason, keep regenerativ ability of particular organ, as quite a lot of highly-specialized cells can't divide any more). However, there are a few documented cases with regnancy, where a few cells (embryogenic, thus with bigger \"healing\" power) migrated through placenta to mother's body and healed her diabetes. So theoretically this is possible, as well as host getting cancer from donor's organ. But again, reason why we are transplanting organs is because human body is not particularly great in regenerating itself and those organs won't grow.

Rather, it sounds like you're asking \"How can I make sense of all the various color schemes employed by venomous species?\" So I'll take a stab at it...<\/p>\n\n<p>Animal coloration is a very complex phenomenon, with a number of overlapping physiological traits, evolutionary strategies, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the famous relationship between the monarch and viceroy butterflies, which bear a striking similarity. The viceroy was long regarded as a harmless insect that predators avoided because it resembled the monarch, which many predators find non-appetizing.<\/p>\n\n<p>More recently, it was proposed that the viceroy is also unpalatable. Thus, the similar color patterns may simply reinforce each other. (<a href=\"http://blogs.britannica.com/2011/05/mutual-mimicry-viceroy-monarch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mutual Mimicry: Viceroy and Monarch<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>But that's just one isolated example of a bewildering spectrum of color schemes. Some animals apparently use bright colors as a warning - \"I'm toxic!\" - while other venomous species may be dull colored for whatever reason. A dull-colored species may use its venom to capture prey, which it captures in ambush; thus, it has evolved camouflage, rather than conspicuous colors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Coloration is also about more than warning. Coloration can serve as a means of communication. It can help a member of a species recognize fellow members. Bright colors are very popular in mating rituals.<\/p>\n\n<p>So you have all these overlapping traits and countless unique evolutionary experiments interwoven into a can of worms.<\/p>\n\n<p>One example that comes to mind is venomous snakes native to the United States. The rattlesnake and cottonmouth are pretty drab-colored and generally well camouflaged. Of course, rattlesnakes warn potential enemies with their famous rattles. I think the cottonmouth can be considered fairly drab colored as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the coral snake has a very vivid and distinctive color pattern. And there are snakes that bear a remarkably resemblance to coral snakes (<a href=\"http://www.wildlife-removal.com/snakelookalike.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">see some examples<\/a>). <\/p>\n","answer_id":42573,"question_id":42554,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42554/how-to-understand-aposematism-and-batesian-mimicry","last_activity_date":1453542817,"creation_date":1453472152,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to understand Aposematism and Batesian mimicry","body":"<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong> I want to understand the reason for intense animal colors. I.e. I don't want to understand the variety of the colors, just the intensity.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cethosia_biblis#Description\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia page for Cethosia biblis<\/a> says, the intense colors are a \"warning\" to enemies, which means the enemy is warned by the colors that eating that butterfly may result in death. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...], while the intense color of the dorsal sides of the wings is a warning\n  to predators that the Red Lacewing has a bad taste, deriving from the\n  poisonous host plants of the caterpillars.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In general it would make sense to me, that animals have learned something like \"intense colors means danger\". Although, I don't know how good animals recognize colors, but that would be another question.<\/p>\n\n<p>But poisonous animals don't have necessarily intense colors. E.g. Sydney funnel web spider is very poisonous, but doesn't have intense colors, while on the other side some very intense colored butterflies are not poisonous like explained <a href=\"http://www.kidsbutterfly.org/faq/general/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. As a result, the explanation given in the wikipedia article doesn't make sense to me. I estimate it very unlikely, that animals learned something like \"intense colors means danger\", because there are of course examples where this is not true. <\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I don't think the \"Golden poison frog\" has survived because his enemies recognize his intense colors and conclude \"eating this frog will result in death\" are hence hesitated to eat him.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is:<\/strong> Why does wikipedia say then, the intense colors of Cethosia biblis are a warning for their enemies?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PS:<\/strong> I just found the correct terms for my thoughts (\"aposematism\" and \"batesian mimicry\" and are reading now the appropriate wikipedia article.

For example there is a gene for flower colour, there can be different alleles which give rise to different colours (this is a highly simplified example).

But really here, we won't need to debate the detail of the terminology of what is a thought. Evolution is a process, it is not an organism, it has no brain and can not think. The answer is \"no\".<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I understand evolution as survival of the fittest rule , where its the nature and surroundings that shapes the life by extinction of species which are not fit to survive the nature at that period.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is wrong! \"survival of the fittest\" is just a quick and dirty expression for referring to the process called natural selection. Natural selection describes the fact that alleles conferring higher fitness (that is having lower chance of survival and/or higher fecundity) to individuals carrying the allele, raise in frequency in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Natural selection does not necessarily decrease nor necessarily increase the probability of a population to go extinct.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apart from natural mutation and survival of the fittest is there anything that affects the biological evolution?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Natural selection and \"survival of the fittest\" refers to the same process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, there are other forces that affect evolution (and are absolutely essential) such as mutations and genetic drift.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I want to ask is does our actions (as a species) define our DNA in evolution? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is unclear what you mean by \"define evolution\" and you probably want to replace \"species\" by \"population\". Yes, the current state of population (including the behaviour of its constituent individuals) affect future evolution of the species.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is believed that child of intelligent parent is supposed to be somewhat intelligent as well, is this linked to heritage or just the environment he grows in?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an interesting question.

Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The field is broad and includes foundations in applied mathematics, computer science, biology, statistical physics, genetics, chemistry, evolution, and conservation biology. Theoretical ecology aims to explain a diverse range of phenomena in the life sciences, such as population growth and dynamics, fisheries, competition, evolutionary theory, epidemiology, animal behavior and group dynamics, food webs, ecosystems, spatial ecology, and the effects of climate change.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Theoretical ecology has further benefited from the advent of fast computing power, allowing the analysis and visualization of large-scale computational simulations of ecological phenomena. Importantly, these modern tools provide quantitative predictions about the effects of human induced environmental change on a diverse variety of ecological phenomena, such as: species invasions, climate change, the effect of fishing and hunting on food network stability, and the global carbon cycle.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Computational Biology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Computational biology involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_ecology3\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a> The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in computer science, applied mathematics, animation, statistics, biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, genomics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, and visualization.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Computational biology is different from biological computation, which is a subfield of computer science and computer engineering using bioengineering and biology to build computers, but is similar to bioinformatics, which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Field Ecology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Ecology can be studied empirically through data analysis, through lab experiments or through field observations and experimentations. Field ecology refers to this last point that is, it refers to empirical ecology in the field.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Potential Misunderstanding<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In your post, you seem to suggest that field ecology is a subfield of theoretical ecology. It is not! Either you work as a theoretician or as an empiricist (and then eventually as a field ecologist). Of course many people do both theory and empiric work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that whether you are theoretical or an empiricist working in ecology, you will need to have a good understanding of the theory behind the science of ecology.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Computational biology vs theoretical ecology<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In opposition to empirical ecology and field ecology, computational biology and theoretical ecology do not have a hierarchical relationship. If you work in theoretical ecology you can make analytical modelling or numerical (computer) modelling. If you work in computational biology you could analyze data in genetics, you could model cell processes, you could simulate interacting populations in ecology and many other things.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What should you chose?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>What skills do you need?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do you like data analysis (statistics and R and python coding)?

First, let's get an understanding of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26824/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cell cycle control system<\/a>, as there are some important molecules involved in this system that regulate mitosis. Think of the control system as a series of stoplights: as you mention, there is one stoplight at the G2 phase. There are two additional checkpoints: one at G1 and one in the M (mitotic) phase, just before Anaphase. Why before anaphase? At this stage in mitosis, the cell checks to determine if all of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetochore\" rel=\"nofollow\">kinetochores<\/a> of the duplicated sister chromatids have microtubules attached to them. This is to ensure proper distribution of chromatids in anaphase.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ok, so back to your question: what are some of the molecules involved, or what are some molecules that the cell might need before it proceeds?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Cyclins - these are proteins that are produced in the late S-G2 phases of Interphase. They activate cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Cyclin Dependent Kinases - as the name suggests, these proteins (kinases) are dependent on cyclin in order to operate. The best known Cdk is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturation_promoting_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">MPF<\/a>, short for maturation promoting factor.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Throughout the cell cycle, these Cdks, together with their bound cyclins, are able to phosphorylate various proteins in the cell as it undergoes mitosis. For instance, the MPF would phosphorylate lamins, which are proteins on the nuclear envelope that can initiate degradation of the laminar matrix. This is essential in Prophase, when the nucleus is disassembling. There are many other things it can phosphorylate. For a more complete list, look under \"Targets of MPF\" in the above link for MPF. Take a look at this diagram, taken from Campbell's Biology (9th Ed):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PdOUv.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PdOUv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>There is one other molecule worth mentioning:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Growth factors - these are proteins specifically released by neighboring cells (relative to the cell that is preparing to undergo mitosis). These are crucial for mitosis to even initiate. A great example of a growth factor is PDGF, which stands for \"Platelet Derived Growth Factor\". These PDGFs are released by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet\" rel=\"nofollow\">platelets<\/a> at sites of injury, such as a cut on your knee. The PDGFs stimulate cell division and help your skin to reheal!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are many other essential nutrients that cells require before they can initiate mitosis; not all have been listed here.

Therefore, why don't we see more sexually reproducing species than asexually reproducing species? Sexually reproducing species have an advantage, don't they?<\/p>\n","question_id":27791,"tags":["genetics","evolution","reproduction","recombination","asexual-reproduction"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":243,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1453392661},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":14886,"edited":false,"creation_date":1391786332,"comment_id":19920,"body":"Thanks a lot for this literature.

I don't know if you are familiar with the mid-90s papers by Otto et al. (<a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/131/3/745\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Otto &amp; Goldstein. 1992. Recombination and the evolution of diploidy.

Mating systems and the evolutionary transition between haploidy and diploidy. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 57(3)\">Otto &amp; Marks, 1996<\/a>), but these are definately relevant to your question. They deal with the \"masking hypothesis\" of diploidy, i.e. that deleterious mutations can be masked by \"healthy\" alleles, and the trade-offs between diploidy (ploidy level), recombination rate and purging of deleterious alleles. <a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/131/3/745\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Otto &amp; Goldstein. 1992. Recombination and the evolution of diploidy. Genetics 131(3)\">Otto &amp; Goldstein (1992)<\/a> shows that recombination is essential for the evolution of diploidy, and without recombination haploids will \"win\" over diploids.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1996.tb00309.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Otto &amp; Marks. 1996. Mating systems and the evolutionary transition between haploidy and diploidy. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 57(3)\">Otto &amp; Marks (1996)<\/a> is a fairly comprehensive paper that builds on the previous one, and looks at how different mating systems interacts with recombination and purging to influence the evolution of ploidy levels. As a general results they predict a correlation between mating system and poidy level, with sexual reproduction favoring diploidy while asexual reproduction favors haploidy. However, from what I can see after a quick re-read, there is nothing that prohibits asexually reproducing species to be diploid (and vice-versa) - see e.g. page 206 - and the paper includes a condition that must hold for diploids to invade in asexually reproducing or selfing populations. I have not followed this litterature closely though, and I imagine that tracing recent papers that cite <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1996.tb00309.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Otto &amp; Marks. 1996. Mating systems and the evolutionary transition between haploidy and diploidy. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 57(3)\">Otto &amp; Marks (1996)<\/a> can be useful to find further relevant studies.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should also consider that ploidy levels can differ between sexes (e.g. bees), which can lead to antagonistic selection which can influence ploidy evolution (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Immler &amp; Otto. 2014. Driven Apart: The Evolution of Ploidy Differences between the Sexes under Antagonistic Selection.

However, I imagine that it can be extremely difficult to prove that a lineage have only reproduced asexually (or never asexually), since these things are hard to track in fossils. Also consider that it is common to have both sexual and asexual stages, and many species can have a long asexual diploid stage followed by a shorter sexual haploid stage. From what I know, this is the norm in e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae#Life-cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">algae<\/a> (arguably a group of fairly \"basal\" taxa). However, I don't know what the ancestral state of algae was (i.e. if they became diploid before having a sexual stage).<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the ancestral state of eukaryotes, there seems to be evidence that the ancestral state was in fact facultatively sexual (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00013156\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Dacks &amp; Roger. 1999.

However, this is only based on a couple of quick litterature searches on my part, and I am in no way an expert in this area. There are probably more recent studies on this topic as well. However, it is clear that you cannot blindly assume that eukaryotic haploid is ancestral. <\/p>\n","answer_id":14886,"question_id":14831,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1391726925},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f8a4da7480c620ebaa9ed7c31fb227b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4840,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4840/a-kennard","reputation":1429,"display_name":"A.

Functionally, if we are simplifying the issue, male gametes can be viewed only as carriers of genetic information, while female gametes also contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of a newly formed embryo.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30562,"question_id":30560,"up_vote_count":22,"last_edit_date":1428531606},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24073c0a25135ce8ded98b78365c6684?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15011,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15011/guitarpicker","reputation":121,"display_name":"GuitarPicker"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1426775935,"creation_date":1426775935,"body":"<p>In general, It's pretty much the reproductive cells with plants and animals.

It is aimed to detect and destroy invading pathogens but it can also target the self, as exemplified in autoimmune diseases. To avoid this, many failsafe mechanisms exists.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, imagine an innocuous foreign antigen gets into your body and reaches the lymph node. There it may find a naive B cell that has a receptor that recognizes it. Without a double check mechanism this B cell will mature and begin to produce antibodies against this antigen, triggering an immune response that is not beneficial (e.g. in allergy) and is not necessary (the antigen is harmless).<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of this, activation of the adaptive immune system requires usually two signals. In the context of B cells the other signal usually comes from effector CD4 T cells (of the type T follicular helper T<sub>fh<\/sub>) and is called <em>linked recognition<\/em>, because both the naive B cell and the T<sub>fh<\/sub> cell have to be specific for the same antigen.<\/p>\n\n<p>So a possible scenario may look something like this: a pathogen's antigen is taken by DCs. If there is an ongoing inflammatory response this DCs will get fully activated (a process called <em>licensing<\/em>) and migrate to the lymph nodes. There they present the antigen to naive T cells. Naive T cells specific for the antigen mature and become effector T cells that may include CD8 and several classes of CD4 T cells, including CD4 T<sub>fh<\/sub> cells. The antigen is also transported to the lymph nodes and presented to naive B cells. Naive B cells that recognize the antigen AND also are stimulated by T<sub>fh<\/sub> specific for the same antigen then mature into plasma cells that secrete antibodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>For harmless antigens, even though DCs may phagocyte them they will not get fully activated in the absence of an inflammatory response. So the activation chain is broken. This system fails somehow in the case of allergy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another point is that this mechanism is related to the generation of antibodies against microbial protein antigens. Animals lacking T cells cannot produce them and so they are called thymus-dependent (TD) antigens. Other microbial antigens like bacterial polysaccharides can induce antibody production without the help of T cells. This so called thymus-independent (TI) antigens provide the second signal by direct recognition of the antigen (e.g. through TLRs) or by inducing extensive crosslinking of B cell receptor (BCR). TI antigens include LPS and bacterial DNA. TI antigens appear earlier than TD antigens and although provide some protection they are less efficient than the TD ones because TI-specific B cells do not undergo affinity maturation and isotype class switching as TD antigens do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong>: Most of what I describe is found in <em>Janeway's Immunobiology, 8th edition.

Animals usually choose to forage in high-quality habitats that has a low risk of predation, but if food sources are depleted (or competition and/or territoriality is high) they will move to other areas with lower food quality or higher risk (since they are desperate for food).<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, the effect of predators are both direct (killing of prey) and indirect (changes in prey behavior to avoid predation). The indirect effects means that prey will often choose to feed in habitats that are suboptimal from the perspective of forage quality, which will have negative effects on their foraging efficiency. These types of indirect effects of predators are often labelled as '<em>The landscape of fear<\/em>' or the '<em>ecology of fear<\/em>' (see e.g. <a href=\"http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/2/385\">Brown et al, 1999<\/a>). However, as food resources run out this will trade-off against the fear of predators (along with possible habituation effects), which will lead to the behaviour you are asking for. You might also be interested in <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075469\">Gamelius et al (2014)<\/a>, as an example of how prey behaviour can be influenced by the presence of predators (here, roe deer and lynx), but there is a large number of studies looking into these issues. The review \"<em>Fear in animals: a meta-analysis and review of risk assessment<\/em>\" by <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1581/2627.short\">Stankowich &amp; Blumstein (2005)<\/a> will also give you a good background and many examples.<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow\">scarecrows<\/a> is a simple way to understand the 'landscape of fear'. By placing a scarecrow in a field you strengthen the \"landscape of fear\" (by adding an artificial 'predator'), which will modify the behaviour of perceived pest species (prey), so that they avoid the areas around the scarecrow. However, if the animals you want to scare away (\"pests\") run out of food they will take larger risks and venture closer to the scarecrow to forage. Over time, they will also become habituated to the scarecrow, and will discover that it doesn't seem to pose a big threat, which will decrease the effectiveness of the scarecrow.<\/p>\n\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/2/385\">Brown et al. 1999. <em>The Ecology of Fear: Optimal Foraging, Game Theory, and Trophic Interactions<\/em>.

Is it safe to assume that a current will <strong>spread through grey matter more easily than white matter<\/strong>, because of all the insulation provided by the myelin? Is it then safe to assume that, if you stimulated tissue which has white matter on one side of the electrode and grey matter on the other, the <strong>current would preferentially flow through the grey matter<\/strong>? <\/p>\n\n<p>As an example I tried to sketch something that would represent a deep brain stimulation electrode in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) sending pulses through its bottom electrode (let's assume the return electrode is the implant case and far away from the target structure). As the STN is close to the internal capsule, I'm wondering if any assumptions can be made about the tissue activation region.

These mechanisms cause a change in the mean of trait, or variance in a trait etc.. Just to summarise the conditions you gave:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>a<\/em>) Trait $i$ has variation<\/p>\n\n<p><em>b<\/em>) Trait $i$ covaries with fitness ($\\omega$)<\/p>\n\n<p><em>c<\/em>) Trait $i$ is heritable from parent to offspring<\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic drift is the random loss of genetic variance from the population by stochastic processes. Mutation (generally) generates new genetic variation within populations. Migration can lead to loss (emigration) or gain (immigration) of genetic variation from a population, as variants come or go from a population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Selection is mechanism underlying adaptation. This is what is in condition <em>b<\/em> of the conditions you gave. We can predict the response to selection using some simple quantitative genetics in the form of the (multivariate) breeders equation.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bio.tamu.edu/users/ajones/gmatrixonline/gmatrixonline.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$\\Delta z = G\\beta$<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Where $\\Delta z$ is the response in the trait, $G$ is the genetic (co)variance matrix, and $\\beta$ is the selection. <\/p>\n\n<p>In a simple toy example we could look at a single trait, $i$. We allow $i$ to satisfy all of the above conditions. This means that both $G$ and $\\beta$ are non-zero, and therefore, $\\Delta z_i$ will also be non-zero. Just putting some random numbers in to the equation to make it clear, if $G = 0.5$ and $\\beta = 0.8$ then;<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\Delta z_i = 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 0.4$<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutation, drift, and migration could all oppose or distort the effect of selection. In other words, they can cause <strong>the actual and predicted response to be different from one another (i.e. $\\Delta z_i \\neq 0.4$), and there will not necessarily be a change in the phenotypic distribution.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>However, <strong>selection is <em>also<\/em> factor that could cause a difference between the predicted and actual response to selection<\/strong> in trait $i$. This is because genetic correlations can arise among traits, either by linkage (close proximity in the DNA) or pleiotropy (when one gene affects more than one trait). For example, we may see no response at all in $i$ ($\\Delta z_i = 0$) when both $G_i$ and $\\beta_i$ are non-zero, if selection on a second unmeasured trait, $j$, opposes selection on $i$ ($\\beta_i = -\\beta_j$), and trait $j$ has equal variance ($G_i = G_j$) and is perfectly covarying with $i$, $cov_{i,j} 1$. Approximately this would be;<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\Delta z_i = (G_i \\times \\beta_i) +  (G_{i,j} \\times \\beta_j$)<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\Delta z_i = (0.5 \\times 0.8) + (0.5 \\times -0.8) = 0$<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a major issue in the study of evolutionary biology. Genetic correlations can cause severe disparity between the actual and predicted response to selection and univariate methods are insufficient as a result. More studies adopt multivariate methods these days, though these are generally limited to just a handful of traits so its still not perfect. In reality methodological and logistical constraints present a huge obstacle to being able to predict $\\Delta z_i$.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41843,"question_id":41813,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1453239118}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41813/why-even-if-all-requirements-for-natural-selection-are-met-it-may-not-happen","last_activity_date":1453239118,"creation_date":1451242061,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why even if all requirements for natural selection are met, it may not happen?","body":"<p>In the book written by John Endler Natural Selection in the Wild p. 4 <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rAULZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rAULZ.jpg\" alt=\"Natural Selection in the Wild p. 4\"><\/a> \nit says that even if condition a, b and c are met, evolution by natural selection might occur, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] , but not necessarily, [...]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>See last paragraph of the image. \nEndler, J.

I am hoping someone can come up with a good answer of what the regression look like depending on what clades we include in the regression."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":24482,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417577805,"comment_id":39241,"body":"Note also, that in general large species suffer from the presence of human and therefore, such regression is likely to be very different today to what it was a 1000 years ago."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":9,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":24495,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417603563,"comment_id":39267,"body":"dang thats 2 billion people tops."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"post_id":24495,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"edited":false,"creation_date":1417606875,"comment_id":39271,"body":"@shigeta but that is using the entire surface of the earth, right (including water)?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":24495,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417705302,"comment_id":39389,"body":"I <i>think<\/i> I googled the land area of the earth, but it would include antarctica.

The relationship between population density/abundance and body size is an old topic in ecology, that fall within the field of allometrics (how different features of organisms scale with body size). A closely related allometric relationship is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber&#39;s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kleiber's law<\/a>, which deals with the relationship between body size and metabolic rate. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your assumption of a generally negative relationship between body size and abundance is correct, and the relationship is approximately linear on a log-log scale. As mentioned in the comments, the exact shape of the regression will depend on what organism groups that are included, since the scaling relationship is known to differ between taxa. However, to get a reasonable ballpark figure we can look at a the classic paper by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v290/n5808/abs/290699a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Damuth. 1981. Population density and body size in mammals. Nature 290: 699-700\">Damuth (1981)<\/a>, which include 307 mammal herbivores. The scaling relationship found there is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$D = 10^{4.23}*W^{-0.75}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where density (D) is in individuals per km<sup>2<\/sup> and body weight is adult body mass in grams. Using your example of 70kg for humans would result in a predicted density of 3.9 individuals/km<sup>2<\/sup>. The scaling coefficient -0.75 (or -3/4) is often labelled \"Damuth's rule\", and is usually also found when pooling both ectoterms and endoterms.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, remember that this regression was based on primary consumers, i.e. mainly herbivore grazers. Alternative data for groups of mammals can be found in <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2461591\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Peters &amp; Raelson. 1984. Relations between Individual Size and Mammalian Population Density. Am Nat\">Peters &amp; Raelson (1984)<\/a>. That paper present both regressions for carnivores+omnivores as well as a regression for all groups of mammals (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores). The relationship for carivores + omnivores (CO) is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$D = 15.7*W^{-1.15}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>and the regression with all groups is (HCO):<\/p>\n\n<p>$$D = 40.7*W^{-0.859}$$\nIn both of these regressions body weight is expressed in kg. Using the CO regression results in a predicted human density of 0.1 individuals/km<sup>2<\/sup>, and the HCO regression gives a human density of 1.1 individuals/km<sup>2<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking at these values, it is reasonable to assume that the predicted \"natural\" population density of humans lie in the range 0.1 - 4 individuals/km<sup>2<\/sup>, but certainly biased towards the lower part of the range. I suspect that a regression looking only at primates would predict an even lower value, so I would not rule out values below 0.1 individuals/km<sup>2<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get a grasp of what this means in actual population numbers, we can extrapolate the densities to the entire earth. If we use the predicted density from the carnivore+omnivore model in <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2461591\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Peters &amp; Raelson. 1984. Relations between Individual Size and Mammalian Population Density. Am Nat\">Peters &amp; Raelson (1984)<\/a> and the entire land area of the earth, which is ~150 million km<sup>2<\/sup> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia: Earth<\/a>), the predicted human population would be about <strong>18 million<\/strong>. Using the high estimate from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v290/n5808/abs/290699a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Damuth. 1981. Population density and body size in mammals. Nature 290: 699-700\">Damuth (1981)<\/a> would correspond to about <strong>600 million<\/strong> people. However, remember that this is using the entire land area, including deserts, mountain ranges and arctic areas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another point of reference is the estimated historical human population density during the Paleolithic, when we lived as hunter-gatherers. I have often seen population densities in the area of 1 per mile<sup>2<\/sup>, i.e. 2.6 individuals per km<sup>2<\/sup>. These estimates are naturally very uncertain, but shows that the allometric scaling relationships seem to provide at least reasonable order-of-magnitude estimates of \"natural\" human population density.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also somewhat enlightening to consider that our current human population size of 7 billion correspond to the predicted population size of a 380 gram carnivorous mammal (using the CO relationship from <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2461591\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Peters &amp; Raelson. 1984. Relations between Individual Size and Mammalian Population Density. Am Nat\">Peters &amp; Raelson (1984)<\/a>), making the unrealistic assumption that this mammal has managed to colonize all land areas on earth. This shows pretty clearly what an outlier modern humans represent.<\/p>\n\n<p>The generality of these types of relationships for predicting densities of individual species can however be questioned. For instance, the regression relationships also differ between climatic regions (see <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2461591\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Peters &amp; Raelson. 1984. Relations between Individual Size and Mammalian Population Density. Am Nat\">Peters &amp; Raelson (1984)<\/a> for more), and, as indicated in the comment by @remi.b, it is also unclear what population states that should be included. For instance, should only populations densities in \"ideal\" habitats be used, when we know that population densities of the same species can differ by orders of magnitude in different habitats? It is also unclear if/how to consider the effects of modern humans. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462997\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Silva &amp; Downing. 1995. The Allometric Scaling of Density and Body Mass: A Nonlinear Relationship for Terrestrial Mammals. Am Nat 145(5)\">Silva &amp; Downing (1995)<\/a> also argue that the scaling relationship is nonlinear on the log scale, with a more shallow slope for larger species, and also find essentially no relationship between body size and density within some groups of species. More recent papers have also highlighted that studies on global relationships between density and body size often mix-up several different processes and relationships, see <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347%2807%2900098-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"White et al. 2007.

Such a minimal criterion (e.g. survival to sexual maturuity) would imply that evolution is occurring by <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_16\" rel=\"nofollow\">drift or selection<\/a>, because being non-trivial implies that some members of the evolving population will fail to reproduce. However, evolution also occurs by mutation (and migration). <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, we can have a population at generation $1$, and each individual within that population produces one offspring, present in the next generation. This means no variation in reproduction exists. If generation $2$, the offspring of generation $1$, carry new mutations then the characteristics of generation $1$ and $2$ can differ, and the descendant generation has evolved from the ancestral state. This can be seen in mutation accumulation lines as an example:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In a typical mutation accumulation experiment a single inbred and\n  highly homozygous line is replicated.  Each of the replicated lines is\n  maintained at a very small population size (usually brother sister\n  mating, or in plants, selfing).  These lines are maintained for many\n  generations.

However, that doesn't mean evolution can't be open ended - the conditions outlined in the paper are flawed when trying to compare to nature. Evolution can occur when the \"minimal criterion\" is trivial (when all individuals are capable of meeting the criteria). The existence of a non-trivial MC only implies drift (e.g. some don't reach survival to sexual maturity by bad luck) or selection (e.g. some don't reach sexual maturity because they carry a genetic disease which kills them first).

Don't focus on the colors, but on the concept. It's the same for both replication events. Each strand of a double helix is used as a template to make a new complimentary strand, giving rise to two new DNA helices from the original. In each new double helix, one strand should match that of the double helix it came from before, as it was the template and is the <em>same<\/em> strand. While the other strand, the complimentary strand, has been newly synthesized to match the complimentary strand. In this diagram, every newly synthesized strand is shown in light blue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Start by looking at the first double-helix of DNA (navy blue). During replication, the DNA is unwound and each navy strand is used as a template to create the newly synthesized (complimentary) strand, which is shown in light blue. In this first all navy double helix, you have two navy strands that are <em>each<\/em> used as a template strand and new complimentary strands (light blue) are synthesized to match . This produces the second two helices (navy and light blue). They each have one strand from the original helix (navy), and one new strand (light blue). <\/p>\n\n<p>The process is exactly the same for the second replication event, only, a new color was not introduced to show a newly synthesized strand, so one cannot differentiate between the original (template) strand and the new complimentary strand. Both are pictured as light blue. <\/p>\n\n<p>For the final replication event, only focus on the top navy and light blue helix first. Just as before, the two strands are separated from each other and are <em>both<\/em> used as templates to create a new strand. The navy blue strand is used as a template for a new light blue strand to be transcribed. This produces the top-most helix, where the original strand is shown as navy and the newly transcribed (complimentary) strand is light blue. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just as the navy strand was a template, the light blue strand from the bicolored helix is used as a template strand as well to create the second all light blue helix. This light blue template strand is used to synthesize a new light blue strand, creating the all light blue helix. One of the strands is the original light blue one from the navy and light blue helix, while the other strand is the newly synthesized one. <\/p>\n\n<p>It might've been easier if they had used a different color for the final round of replication, like orange. Then to show the newly synthesized strands in the final round, the 1st and 4th double helix would consist of a navy (original) strand and an orange (newly synthesized) strand. The second and third double helices would then have each had a light blue (original) strand and an orange (newly synthesized) strand. This would have made it easier to understand where each strand originally came from. <\/p>\n","answer_id":42464,"question_id":42459,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42459/the-semi-conservative-model-of-dna-replication-question","last_activity_date":1453158824,"creation_date":1453152164,"answer_count":1,"title":"The Semi-Conservative Model of DNA Replication: Question","body":"<p>My Campbell's Biology textbook contains the following diagram related to the semi-conservative model of DNA replication proposed by Watson and Crick.

Suberisation is complete within 48 hours after wounding,\n  and lignification is complete within 168 hours of wounding..<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Phytoalexin barrier<\/strong> - The last and most important line of resistance is the phytoalexin barrier. Phytoalexins are chemicals\n  produced by plants that impart disease resistance in response to\n  mechanical injury, physiological stimuli or infection. Scopoletin, a\n  coumarin,and para-hydroxy benzoic acid, a phenol, are apparently early\n  arrivals on the scene but later disappear (<a href=\"http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/Disease%20Response%20Mechanism.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are three enemies of carrot storage: wilt, re-growth and rot. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some reasons for carrots rotting faster: <\/p>\n\n<p>Many fruits and vegetables start to produce ethylene gas when they start to ripen. Some foods are extremely sensitive to ethylene gas which makes them rot faster (<a href=\"http://www.coreperformance.com/daily/nutrition/why-fresh-produce-goes-bad-so-fast.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>). I am guessing that you keep different vegetables close together. Maybe if you stored carrots separately, it might make them last a bit longer.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Major post-harvest losses in carrots are due to Sclerotinia rot,\n  Botrytis rot, Bacterial soft rot (Erwinia) and Sour rot (Geotrichum).\n  Of these, Sclerotinia rot is the most prevalent.The Sclerotinia fungus\n  infects the carrot roots in the field through the crown. During\n  storage, the Sclerotinia fungus produces a white, cottony mycelium\n  which covers the roots. Infected roots are usually soft and watery (<a href=\"http://www5.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/doc/pfra.../carrots-carottes_eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There would definitely be more reasons but I am guessing that these are the major contributors to it rotting faster. <\/p>\n","answer_id":19404,"question_id":3694,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1404193056}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3694/why-do-carrots-spoil-so-fast","last_activity_date":1453126701,"creation_date":1348743422,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do carrots spoil so fast?","body":"<p>The carrots we buy from a supermarkets spoil very fast, albeit giving many consumers a false sense of preservability due to their structural rigidity.

The ambiguity about sex leaves two options, 1) red eyed male crossed to white eyed female, 2) white eyed male cross to red eyed female. If it were the former (red eye male) then the mother must have two X chromosomes both of which have do not carry the dominant red eye allele, and all daughters would be red eyed and all sons white eyed (their X always comes from the mother). <\/p>\n\n<p>If it were the latter (white eye male) that would leave two further possibilities, mothers are homo- or heterozygous for the dominant red eye allele. If the mother is homozygous for the red allele then all offspring should have red eyes, all will receive an X that carries the dominant red eye allele.  If the mother is heterozygous then half of the offspring will be red eyed and half white eyed, because both of the fathers sex chromosomes do not have the red allele (the X and the Y) and only one of the mothers carries it.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the exercise, you have <em>some<\/em> white eyed flies in the first offspring, but not all, and most are red eyed. Given the wording of the question (that <em>red eyed <strong>flies<\/strong> were mated to white eyed <strong>flies<\/em><\/strong>, and not <em>a red eyed <strong>fly<\/strong> was mated to a white eyed <strong>fly<\/em><\/strong>) I would suggest that the first generation was produced by crossing multiple red eyed females to multiple white eyed males, and that the females were a mixture of hetero- and homozygotes. Therefore <em>some<\/em> of the offspring were white eyed. The point being, <strong>with the first cross it is impossible to tell whether the females used were each hetero- or homozygotes, you can't deduce their genotype.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ukz05.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ukz05.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the second cross, both parents have red eyes.

The <em>implied/logical<\/em> further outcome is then that 1/4 of the offspring were red eyed males, and 1/2 (2/4) were red eyed females.

The key difference here is that you can establish the <em>genotype<\/em> of the parental flies. <\/p>\n\n<p>The cross below shows this. The sons, who inherit an X from their mother and Y from their father, are white eyed half of the time because there is a 50% chance of inheriting a red eye X from the mother and 0% chance of inheriting a red eye X from the father. Females are always red eyed because the X comes from the father, and he has only one X (which carries the red eyed allele).
