Both of these mechanisms occur during the growth process. Growth in the girth of the muscle fibers... may be stimulated by development of stress creating an unequal pressure with splitting at the Z-band and development of additional SR and T-tubule systems. This adds to the diameter or girth of myofibers without any hyperplasia. The growth in length occurs at either end of the fibers and results in addition of new sarcomeres. In both cases, new myofibrillar protein must be synthesized and deposited in the muscle cells. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Adding or removing sarcomeres and myofibrils is determined by exercise, that is, the degree of force a muscle can generate which is in turn dependent on the degree of overlap of the thick and thin filaments. Thus, the amount of tension would control the number of in-series sarcomeres and the number of myofibrils in a single muscle fiber. <\/p>\n\n<p>Nutrition is also known to play an important role in muscle growth, but growth (that is, increase in girth) cannot occur without exercise. <\/p>\n\n<p>The exact roles of GF and IGF-I are not completely clear.<\/p>\n\n<p>Muscle size does not increase by the addition of new muscle cells:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The results show that the <em>increase in muscle cross-sectional area from childhood to adult age is caused by an increase in mean fiber size.<\/em> This is accompanied by a functional development of the fiber population: the proportion of type 2 fibers increases significantly from the age of 5 (approx. 35%) to the age of 20 (approx. 50%), which, <strong>in the absence of any discernible effect on the total number of fibers<\/strong>, is most likely caused by a transformation of type 1 to type 2 fibers.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Activation of satellite cells<\/em>, a claim made by body builders, is mis-represented by them.

TUBG1 was expressed ubiquitously, whereas TUBG2 was primarily\n  detected in the brain. The development of TUBG1-deficient (Tubg1-/-)\n  embryos stopped at the morula/blastocyst stages due to a\n  characteristic mitotic arrest: the mitotic spindle was highly\n  disorganized, and disorganized spindles showed one or two pole-like\n  foci of bundled MTs that were surrounded by condensed chromosomes.\n  TUBG2 was expressed in blastocysts, but could not rescue the TUBG1\n  deficiency.

In the brain of wild-type mice, TUBG2\n  was expressed in approximately the same amount as TUBG1, but no\n  histological abnormalities were found in the Tubg2-/- brain.

On the Pauling\n  scale, if the result is less than 0.4, the bond is generally nonpolar\n  covalent. If the result is between 0.4 and 1.7, the bond is generally\n  polar covalent. If the result is greater than 1.7 the bond is\n  generally considered ionic.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>wikipedia - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity\" rel=\"nofollow\">chemical polarity<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Water is polar. because oxygen (3.5) is more electronegative than hydrogen (2.2) and the difference (1.3) is between 0.4÷1.7. So the oxygen has a slight negative charge, while the hydrogens have slight positive charges in water.<\/p>\n\n<p>Polar molecules are hydrophile. e.g NH<sub>3<\/sub>, EtOH, etc... Apolar (or nonpolar) molecules are usually hydrophobe, but there can be exceptions e.g. Cl<sub>2<\/sub> is apolar, but more water soluble than CO or CO<sub>2<\/sub>, because of a chemical reaction (Cl<sub>2<\/sub> + H<sub>2<\/sub>O → HOCl + HCl). Alcohols contain the polar -OH group. Short chain alcohols are water soluble and so hydrophile, while long chain alcohols are less water soluble, they are hydrophob, because most of the molecule contains apolar bonds. Molecules with ionic bonds, like NaCl are hydrophilic, but not necessary water soluble (e.g. AgCl is poorly soluble in water). So I think hydrophilicity and polarity are not synonyms. However these are just the exceptions, most of the hydrophilic compounds are polar and most of the hydrophobic compounds are apolar.<\/p>\n\n<p>Amino acid residues (and ofc. side chains) are no exceptions, so in the case of them these terms are synonyms (at least by the 20 common amino acid certainly).<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic-polar_protein_folding_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">HP (hydrophobic-polar) protein folding model<\/a> comes from the article of Dill. He talks mostly about solvophobic and solvophilic residues. In the context of water use the terms hydrophobic, polar and charged amino acid residues. This kind of amino acid classification might be older, but (I assume) it was not so important before the HP model.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>solvent to a medium consisting of pure solvophobic residues.

Based on this information you can tell which residues will be in the apolar core (hydrophobic residues) and which will be on the polar exterior (hydrophobic residues) and which will create the backbone hydrogen bonds (polar residues) and probably salt bridges (polar, charged residues).

Also this discusses evolution in terms of taxanomic radiation, e.g. macroevolution at large spatial and temporal scales.<\/p>\n\n<p>Problem 1 is that you haven't been clear about what kind of competition, inter or intraspecific competition?  These will have opposing effects generally which can counter balance each other <a href=\"http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0018\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.1253\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]<\/a>.  When a species is free from interspecific competition, but under high intraspecific competition, that will promote an adaptive radiation, which concurrent morphological changes.  The most famous example of this would be Darwin's finches as studied by the Grants <a href=\"http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1070315\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]<\/a>.  With a lack of interspecific competition, the finches exhibited rapid morphological divergence.  Following the logic of this, you'll see that lack of competition will lead the kind of rapid taxanomic radiation the video is discussing, especially over a longer time scale.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However increased interspecific competition will have two effects. It will reduce the number of available niches for an existing species to expand into <a href=\"http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01026.x\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]<\/a>, this generally will drive specialization of a species, which tends to limit genetic diversity which will lead to less \"raw material\" for evolution to work with. This specialization though is also technically evolution.  However with fewer niches, the new species tend to arise via replacement of existing species in an existing niche, as opposed to an adaptive radiation.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So you can see how actually both conclusions are right depending on the type of evolution and competition being considered.  <\/p>\n\n<p>More interspecific competition -> More specialization (one type of evolution), less adaptive radiation (another type of evolution)<\/p>\n\n<p>More intraspecific competition -> More adapative radiation, less specialization.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps answer your question.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23888,"question_id":23877,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23877/confusion-regarding-niches-in-evolution-theory","last_activity_date":1415663485,"creation_date":1415640533,"answer_count":1,"title":"Confusion regarding niches in evolution theory","body":"<p>This is the definition of a <strong>niche<\/strong> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Course_(YouTube)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crash Course<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An area of the environment that requires a special set of skills or traits to extract food and reproduce.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously, this version of the definition has been dummed so that it appeals to mass audiences, but after some research, I believe that the general concept remains the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is what I've learnt about species living in a niche:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The more the competition, the slower the evolutionary process.<\/li>\n<li>Lack of competition provides an ideal environment rapid evolution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>But these points seem non-intuitive to me, because:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why would a increased competition slow down the evolutionary process?

It does this by counting how many cycles of amplification (2^) it needs to reach a threshold. So to simplify everything lets assume that 1024 copies would require 10 cycles (2^10). If there are more copies it would take less cycles to reach the threshold, therefore 2024 copies would take 9 cycles, 512 copies 11 cycles etc.. Now imagine the following scenario:<\/p>\n\n<p>We have the following samples:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Sample 1. 1024 copies of gene A and 4096 copies of gene B\nSample 2. 1024 copies of gene A and 16384 copies of gene B\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now we want to compare sample 2 to 1, with gene B in relation to gene A:<\/p>\n\n<p>In absolute numbers this would be:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Sample 1. 4096 / 1024 = 4x more B\nSample 2. 16384 / 1024 = 16x more B\nThe average amount more B = (16 + 4) / 2 = 10x more B\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now with qPCR the same samples from above would look like the following:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Sample 1. Gene A 10 cycles, Gene B 8 cycles.\nSample 2. Gene A 10 cycles, Gene B 6 cycles.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now using the methods standard used for qPCR data we first take the difference between Gene B and A. Followed by the mean of the difference and this is taken 2^. <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Sample 1. 10 - 8 = 2 cycles\nSample 2. 10 - 6 = 4 cycles\nThe average amount more B = 2^((2 + 4)/2) = 8x more B\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>All publications / software tools etc will compute an average of 8x more B. And I am aware this originated from a log2 scale, however why does this statistically correct method differ in outcome from absolute numbers?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>\nI oversimplified my question therefore below some more details of my \"problem\".<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Condition 1 biorep 1. 1024 copies of ref and 1024 copies of gene X\nCondition 1 biorep 2. 1024 copies of ref and 1024 copies of gene X\nCondition 2 biorep 1. 1024 copies of ref and 4096 copies of gene X\nCondition 2 biorep 2. 1024 copies of ref and 16384 copies of gene X\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>So to compute in absolute numbers the average amount more of gene X in condition 2 versus 1:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>We can forget the reference gene here as cDNA amounts are the same, therefore: \nCondition 1 biorep 1 &amp; 2: average (1024 + 1024) / 2 = 1024 copies\nCondition 2 biorep 1 &amp; 2: average (4096 + 16384) / 2 = 10240 copies\nCondition 2 vs 1: average 10240 / 1024 = 10x more gene X in condition 2 vs 1\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now with qPCR CT values based on the numbers above:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Condition 1 biorep 1. Ref_CT 10 and GeneX_CT 10\nCondition 1 biorep 2. Ref_CT 10 and GeneX_CT 10\nCondition 2 biorep 1. Ref_CT 10 and GeneX_CT 8\nCondition 2 biorep 1. Ref_CT 10 and GeneX_CT 6\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now using the official qPCR calculations:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Condition 1, Ref_CT mean (10 + 10) / 2 = 10\nCondition 2, Ref_CT mean (10 + 10) / 2 = 10\nCondition 1, GeneX_CT mean (10 + 10) / 2 = 10\nCondition 2, GeneX_CT mean (8 + 6) / 2 = 7\n\nRef_deltaCT (10 - 10) = 0\nGeneX_deltaCT (10 - 7) = 3\n\ndelta_deltaCT (3 - 0) = 3\nDifference Condition 2 vs 1 = (2^3) = 8x\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This equates to 8x more of Gene X on average in condition 2 compare to condition 1. Here now is the difference of 8x vs 10x. Also any program you will use to fill in these CT values it will result in a ratio of 8 compared to 10.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this perhaps as this method equating to 8 should only be used for technical replicates, and bioreps should use a different equation resulting into 10?<\/p>\n","question_id":23734,"tags":["pcr","statistics","quantitative-genetics"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":23753,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":336,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1415275044},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3df7f577cfa8431e297425d69c7ff92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1766,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1766/pankaj-phartiyal","reputation":161,"display_name":"Pankaj Phartiyal"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab24c0e23c30888c23e2d4fe9991cf2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":57,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/57/jonsca","reputation":3367,"display_name":"jonsca","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"post_id":5470,"edited":false,"creation_date":1355242080,"comment_id":7874,"body":"...and your question is?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":5470,"edited":false,"creation_date":1355313429,"comment_id":7884,"body":"To clarify how you could edit your question to make it more suitable for the site, we&#39;d be happier to answer a question asking for an explanation of which features to look out for when purchasing a microscope."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1415569315,"creation_date":1399741251,"body":"<p>Well it depends on the application.

In other words, would cells exposed to e.g. targeted kinase inhibitors slowly compensate with other pathways (and that would happen in every such cell) or would there be a sub-population of cells that is sensitive to inhibitors and another subpopulation inherently resistant and predisposed towards amplifying other pathways.<\/p>\n","question_id":23823,"tags":["cancer"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IJn3IhW4A08/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ptPEfbC6RC8/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":10045,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10045/souvik-bhattacharya","reputation":603,"display_name":"souvik bhattacharya","accept_rate":50},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":23767,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415295580,"comment_id":37557,"body":"please don&#39;t just copy and paste from a source, especially if you are not crediting them (<a href=\"http://insects.about.com/od/adaptations/p/wintersurvival.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">insects.about.com/od/adaptations/p/wintersurvival.htm<\/a>) see the help pages on how to write a good answer"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IJn3IhW4A08/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ptPEfbC6RC8/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":10045,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10045/souvik-bhattacharya","reputation":603,"display_name":"souvik bhattacharya","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":23767,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"edited":false,"creation_date":1415358016,"comment_id":37631,"body":"Sorry...I&#39;m changing my answer...&amp; this time it&#39;s not a copy-paste..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78f38914e0d07733567672a47c53904b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8015,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8015/hav0k","reputation":1090,"display_name":"Hav0k"},"score":0,"post_id":23767,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415393007,"comment_id":37673,"body":"Well, these are some nice pictures, but your answer has nothing to do with the actual question.

Any deeper, and the lungs shrink, making it negatively buoyant. Any shallower, and the lungs expand, making it positively buoyant. <\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, until it reaches depth D, the animal is positively buoyant. To get to depth D, the animal would have to do a lot of work swimming down, fighting against its own floatiness. <\/p>\n\n<p>The amount of air that keeps you neutrally buoyant at 10 meters will inflate to twice the volume once you surface, keeping you pinned there.

One guess is that they actually exhale fully before diving, thus making lung buoyancy a small player in the overall body buoyancy.

It is generally used in the context of evolution. A conserved characteristic or gene or protein means that it has 'survived' a long time without being altered. As @Bez mentions, certain parts of the protein machinery in eukaryotes is very different from prokaryotes, the latter being considered to have arisen much earlier in evolution. For example, some post-transcriptional processes (e.g. splicing <a href=\"http://www.majordifferences.com/2013/10/difference-prokaryotic-and-vs.html#.VFyoRk0cTs0\" rel=\"nofollow\">and many more differences<\/a>) only occur in eukaryotes. But there are many similarities as well, such as the basic use of mRNA etc (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22531/\" rel=\"nofollow\">book section<\/a>). The latter are examples of conserved mechanisms.  In the context of your question, it means that when you take eukaryotic DNA to express eukaryotic proteins it doesn't really matter which cell or host organism you take as it will be transcribed and folded correctly. For example, yeast is often used to express DNA from higher organisms as its protein synthesis is much the same across various eukaryotic species. However, expressing eukaryotic DNA in prokaryotes likely ends up in misfolded proteins without proper post-transcriptional modification and should be avoided. <\/p>\n\n<p>As to your follow-up question: Folding of proteins happens in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>), a cell organelle absent in prokaryotes as they lack a nucleus and associated organelles. Again, expression of eukaryotic genes in a prokaryotic expression system will end up in mis-folded proteins.     <\/p>\n\n<p>To get back to your overall question - the 'signals': DNA transcription, splicing, protein synthesis, post translational modification and folding are all regulated by signals, such as specific DNA codons to start and stop transcription, RNA codes for splicing and start translation and protein tags that are placed on specific amino acid combinations. These signals are well conserved across eukaryotic species.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":23799,"question_id":23783,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1415361674}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23783/what-does-it-mean-for-the-signals-for-transcription-and-translation-to-be-conse","last_activity_date":1415361674,"creation_date":1415317130,"answer_count":1,"title":"What does it mean for the signals for transcription and translation to be \"conserved\"?","body":"<p>I was reading this article: \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F12196921_Overview_of_vector_design_for_mammalian_gene_expression%2Flinks%2F0912f50b859ea95140000000&amp;ei=ygFcVKzCHteUsQSpm4LoAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJpnMNYd2BQzxgF8-08QC2Mw9dTQ&amp;sig2=3FJpi89PA0wj3WKu3eJmfQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Overview of vector design for mammalian gene expression.<\/a>\"  for an explanation of why mammalian cell lines are used for expressing cloned genes, and one of the reasons given is that \"DNA cloned from higher eukaryotic cells is readily expressed since the signals for transcription, mRNA processing, and translation are conserved in higher eukaryotic systems.\" What does it mean for the signals to be \"conserved,\" and why does this make mammalian cells a better host than other types of cells?<\/p>\n\n<p>Follow-up question, in case the answer to that question doesn't make it clear: the article also says the machinery for protein folding and assembly are \"conserved\" - what does that mean (if not the same thing as in the first question) - and again, why does this make mammalian cells a superior choice of host for expressing cloned genes?<\/p>\n","question_id":23783,"tags":["molecular-genetics","gene-expression","cell-culture","mammals"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1415343013},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":1,"post_id":23247,"edited":false,"creation_date":1413573108,"comment_id":36325,"body":"Some RNAse enzymes are capable of renaturing, makes it annoying to get rid of them."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":23247,"edited":false,"creation_date":1413580651,"comment_id":36329,"body":"&quot;Very few proteins have disulfide bonds or really any covalent bond stabilizing the amino acid chain &quot; - can you add some reference about this? e.g. insuline, egg yolk proteins, gluten, hair proteins contain disulfide bonds.

But let me answer your questions...<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Very few proteins have disulfide bonds <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bond#Occurrence_in_proteins\" rel=\"nofollow\">(usually secreted proteins)<\/a> or really any covalent bond stabilizing the amino acid chain beyond the bonds that make up the polypeptide itself.  Denaturation is only reversible in relatively few cases in fact.  A few proteins, usually very small ones can be nursed back into a native folded state from an unfolded one, and then only a percentage of the sample will reattain the folded state.  <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Sure.  In fact pressure changes the hydrogen bonded structure of the water and also therefore the thermodynamics of protein structure and has been used to study protein folding. Generally the electomagnetic field does not affect the state of the protein fold.  I cite the fact that many many proteins have been studied via nuclear magnetic resonance, in which the proteins have been inserted into some of the most powerful magnets that can fit into a reasonably sized room.   That is not to say that the protein <em>function<\/em> might not be affected by such a field.  I'm sure by the time the field is large enough to ionize water or the peptide change you would see something... so you can always push things too the breaking point.  <\/p>\n\n<p>3) Many proteins from thermophilic organisms are more resistant to denaturation and companies actually engineer proteins to be resistant to all sorts of outrageous conditions and still be folded and functional.  Laundry detergent is full of crystallized enzymes that will sit happily in detergent for a long time.  I don't even know if these products have a shelf life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall proteins are vulnerable to denaturation for a good reason- the cell degrades them when it doesn't need their function and can recycle them for their component amino acids. If they were all this robust the cell would starve to death quickly.  If there is a biological role to a protein that is denatured and then refolds itself it is only for extremely rare situations.  Proteins for the most part don't fall apart once they are folded and if they do, they are done. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some possible exceptions: some antibiotic peptides which fold into pores that kill their targets and the amyloid plaque which takes on a different fold when in the brain which is associated with - but may not cause - Alzheimer's.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":23247,"question_id":23246,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1413607266},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":23250,"edited":false,"creation_date":1413580119,"comment_id":36328,"body":"Thanks you answer it was interesting. +1 I am not worried about anything, I just want to learn more about the details of how denaturation works.

Proteins have a 3d structure (composed by their primary, secondary and tertiary structures). The structure of the proteins is constantly changing between the folded and unfolded states. The folded state has a lower free energy while the unfolded state has a higher. Between them there is a free energy barrier which determines the speed of the folding on a specific temperature. <\/p>\n\n<p>Changing structural on environmental factors can affect these free energies and can shift the equilibrium to the unfolded state. The unfolded protein can suffer irreversible changes (aggregation, disulphide exchange, proteolysis, irreversible subunit dissociation, chemical degradation, etc...), so the denaturation of the protein can be reversible or irreversible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this is a very simplistic view, I think there are different degrees of unfoldedness, and so different things can happen when the protein is in one of these. For instance by a low degree of unfoldedness misfolding can happen which results a stable, but inactive folded state without coagulation (this can be more or less reversible). By a higher degree of unfoldedness coagulation can happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Folding mostly depends on one simple rule: all of the hydrogen bonds have to be satisfied, because a non-satisfied hydrogen bond has a very high energetic cost. The proteins have polar surfaces, which form hydrogen bonds with the water, and one or more apolar center, which have inner hydrogen bonds as backbones. Burial of an unpaired polar amino-acid (e.g. non-satisfied hydrogen bond) is very destabilizing and so it is non-existent in natural working proteins. Other factors, like salt bridges, aromatic-aromatic interactions, disulphide bonds, etc... can affect the stability as well, but hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are the major factors. The weights of these two major factors is most likely protein dependent (a study suggested 75% and 25%, while another 40% and 60%).<\/p>\n\n<p>The backbone hydrogen bonds are usually most stable around room temperature, so the lowest free energy and the maximum stability is around 20°C by most proteins and both heating and cooling lowers the stability and can lead to denaturation. High temperatures (>80°C) can cause covalent degradation, and so irreversible denaturation. Pressure has similar effect on the hydrogen bonds and the stability as cold denaturation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The osmolyte cosolvents like urea or TMAO contribute differently to the free energy of the folded and unfolded states and so shift the equilibrium between them. for example urea can cause denaturation, while TMAO protects the protein from denaturation. I think it is evident that changing pH and saltiness has strong effect on the charges of the amino acid side chains, and so the hydrogen bonds and the stability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both ultrasound and pulsed electric field (PEF) can cause denaturation. The effect seems strongly depending on the parameters of ultrasound/PEF and the type of the protein. Interesting that PEF can increase the enzyme activity too. It is hard to find studies about the denaturation mechanisms by these methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we want to increase the protein stability, the method we choose can depend on what we want to protect the protein from. One or more methods from the following list can help to increase the stability:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>increase of compactness and better packing (minimalization of surface/volume ratio)<\/li>\n<li>increase of electrostatic interactions (formation of additional ion pairs, e.g. more glutamic acid)<\/li>\n<li>additional hydrogen bonds<\/li>\n<li>additional disulphide bridges<\/li>\n<li>increasing hydrophobic interactions (greater proportion of buried hydrophobic residues)<\/li>\n<li>change protein microenvironment (use osmolytes, change pH, saltiness)<\/li>\n<li>glycosylate the protein surface<\/li>\n<li>decrease chain length<\/li>\n<li>change surface amino-acids (the effect can be completely unpredictable, but there are surface residue patterns with known effect on stability; add more ionisable amino acids to the surface; bury hydrophobic residues; etc...)<\/li>\n<li>protein fixation can change the stability as well<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thermodynamic stability of a protein that unfolds and refolds rapidly,\n  reversibly, cooperatively, and with a simple, two-state mechanism. The\n  easiest proteins in which to study folding and stability are those\n  that exhibit this sort of rapid reversibility. Both experimental\n  design and also theoretical treatment of data are simplified by\n  reversible systems. Thus, it is no surprise that most of the\n  literature reports about stability discuss this type of reversible\n  system. The stability of the protein is simply the difference in Gibbs\n  free energy, dG, between the folded and the unfolded states. The only\n  factors affecting stability are the relative free energies of the\n  folded (Gf) and the unfolded (Gu) states. The larger and more positive\n  Gu, the more stable is the protein to denaturation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If a protein unfolds reversibly it may be fully unfolded and inactive\n  at high temperatures, but once it cools to room temperature, it will\n  refold and fully recover activity. In the case of irreversible or\n  slowly unfolding proteins, it is kinetic stability or the rate of\n  unfolding that is important. A protein that is kinetically stable will\n  unfold more slowly than a kinetically unstable protein. In a\n  kinetically stable protein, a large free energy barrier to unfolding\n  is required and the factors affecting stability are the relative free\n  energies of the folded (Gf) and the transition state (Gts) for the\n  first committed step on the unfolding pathway. Irreversible loss of\n  protein folded structure is represented by: F &lt;-> U -> I, where I is\n  inactive due to aggregation, disulphide exchange, proteolysis,\n  irreversible subunit dissociation, chemical degradation, etc...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1996 - <a href=\"http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/projects/day/TDayDiss/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Source of Stability in Proteins<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1110/ps.051401905/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charge\u2013charge interactions in the denatured state influence the folding kinetics of ribonuclease Sa<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2006 - <a href=\"http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/pubs/pdf/951.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Are Proteins Charged?

A related issue\u2014often lost in this\n  debate about comparing peptide\u2013peptide to peptide\u2013 water hydrogen\n  bonds\u2014involves the energetic cost of an unsatisfied hydrogen bond.\n  Here, experiment and theory agree that breaking a hydrogen bond costs\n  between 5 and 6 kcal/mol. Accordingly, the likelihood of finding an\n  unsatisfied hydrogen bond in a protein is insignificant. This\n  realization establishes a powerful rule for evaluating protein\n  conformations.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In their description of the alpha-helix, Pauling et al. (1951)\n  asserted that the energy of the peptide N\u2013H\u2022 \u2022 \u2022O=C hydrogen bond was\n  of order -8 kcal/mol, and that \u201csuch instability would result from the\n  failure to form these bonds that we may be confident of their\n  presence.\u201d Pauling\u2019s earlier estimate of the total protein hydrogen\n  bond energy was -5 kcal/mol (Mirsky and Pauling 1936). From solution\n  studies of urea dimers, Schellman estimated that an intrapeptide\n  hydrogen bond would be enthalpically favored over a peptide\u2013water\n  hydrogen bond by ~1.5 kcal/mol (Schellman 1955). These and similar\n  early studies led to the conclusion that the peptide hydrogen bond is\n  a significant factor in stabilizing protein conformations.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This view was to change dramatically following a famous review by\n  Kauzmann (1959), who invoked the thermodynamics of small model\n  compounds to argue that stabilization of the folded state of a protein\n  is due almost exclusively to the hydrophobic effect. Soon after\n  Kauzmann\u2019s proposal, Klotz and Franzen (1962) determined that the\n  enthalpy of the interamide hydrogen bond of N-methyl acetamide in\n  water was zero, and concluded that \u201cthe intrinsic stability of\n  interpeptide hydrogen bonds in aqueous solution is small.\u201d Similarly,\n  hydrogen bonding involving another small molecule,\n  epsilon-caprolactam, in dilute solution was shown to be negligible\n  (Susi and Ard 1969). Kauzmann\u2019s proposal, bolstered by these later\n  studies, led to the widely held view that the hydrophobic effect makes\n  the major energetic contribution to protein stability, with hydrogen\n  bonds contributing little, or perhaps even opposing, the folding\n  process. See Baldwin (2003) for a recent discussion of these issues.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Protein hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous, directional, and largely local,\n  partitioning the polypeptide chain into alpha- and 3_10-helices,\n  beta-sheet, and beta-turns. Together, these hydrogen-bonded backbone\n  structures account for at least 75% of the conformation, on average,\n  with remaining residues participating in both additional\n  intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrogen bonding to water.\n  Unsatisfied backbone polar groups are energetically expensive, to the\n  degree that they almost never occur. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Force measurements between surfaces functionalized with lipids having\n  hydrogen bonding headgroups (NTA, A, T, and MeT lipids) lead to a\n  reproducible value of the energy of a single hydrogen bond in pure\n  water: ~0.5 kcal/mol. It shows that it is energetically more favorable\n  for the headgroups to make hydrogen bonds with each other than to make\n  hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This is coherent with past\n  studies made on proteins stability, which showed that intramolecular\n  hydrogen bonds in a folded protein are energetically more favorable\n  than bonds with water molecules in an unfolded protein with an average\n  stabilization of ~1 kcal/mol per intramolecular hydrogen bond.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1996 - <a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/10/1/75.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forces contributing to the conformational stability of proteins.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2005 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253345/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Do all backbone polar groups in proteins form hydrogen bonds?<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228361100355X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone-Driven Collapse in Unfolded Protein Chains<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2006 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927106000296\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydrophobic collapse in (in silico) protein folding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2002 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283602004655\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermodynamic Consequences of Burial of Polar and Non-polar Amino Acid Residues in the Protein Interior<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2003 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349503747195\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermodynamics of Heat Activation of Single Capsaicin Ion Channels VR1<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2003 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi027184%2B\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temperature Range of Thermodynamic Stability for the Native State of Reversible Two-State Proteins<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja8056419\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein Cold Denaturation as Seen From the Solvent<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2010 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo101075a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Construction of Peptoids with All Trans-Amide Backbones and Peptoid Reverse Turns via the Tactical Incorporation of N-Aryl Side Chains Capable of Hydrogen Bonding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2002 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349502753678\" rel=\"nofollow\">Energy of Hydrogen Bonds Probed by the Adhesion of Functionalized Lipid Layers<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X11001783\" rel=\"nofollow\">How, when and why proteins collapse: the relation to folding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002169#pcbi-1002169-g003\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inversion of the Balance between Hydrophobic and Hydrogen Bonding Interactions in Protein Folding and Aggregation<\/a> <\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X10001661\" rel=\"nofollow\">Membrane protein folding: how important are hydrogen bonds?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main determinant of cold denaturation tendency is likely the\n  stability decrease of backbone hydrogen bonds at low temperatures,\n  which in turn is affected by the packing manner of the hydrophobic\n  core cluster<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure-\n  and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by\n  measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds\n  are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large\n  sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In\n  contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually\n  unaffected.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We study the stability of globular proteins as a function of\n  temperature and pressure through NPT simulations of a coarse-grained\n  model. We reproduce the elliptical stability of proteins and highlight\n  a unifying microscopic mechanism for pressure and cold denaturations.\n  The mechanism involves the solvation of nonpolar residues with a thin\n  layer of water. These solvated states have lower volume and lower\n  hydrogen-bond energy compared to other conformations of nonpolar\n  solutes. Hence, these solvated states are favorable at high pressure\n  and low temperature, and they facilitate protein unfolding under these\n  thermodynamical conditions.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We further find that it is the changes in hydrophobic hydration with\n  decreasing temperature that drive cold unfolding and that the overall\n  process is enthalpically driven, whereas heat denaturation is\n  entropically driven.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>As a consequence of a weaker penetration upon pressurizing, it was\n  found that the pressure-denatured state was partially unfolded\n  compared with the heat-denatured state. The mechanism of pressure\n  denaturation was related to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond\n  network of water onto a set of clusters characterized by strengthened\n  O \u2013 H interactions, inducing a hardening of protein dynamics. The\n  mechanism is opposite to that observed upon heating, i.e., the\n  softening of the hydrogen bond network of water inducing a softer\n  protein dynamics.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We can conclude that the main driving force of protein denaturation at\n  high pressures is the decrease of the hydrophobic effect as a\n  consequence of the changes in water structure, without contradicting\n  any of the current theories on the hydrophobic effect.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>For the pressure denaturation the weakening of the hydrophobic\n  interaction between the bulky side chains is found to be crucial at\n  lower temperatures, leading to an apparent destabilization of the\n  folded backbone structure at elevated pressures.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2013 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23464178\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molecular dynamics simulation indicating cold denaturation of beta-hairpins.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037270\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cold-Induced Changes in the Protein Ubiquitin<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2008 - <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.118101\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microscopic Mechanism for Cold Denaturation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.030905\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydrophobicity at low temperatures and cold denaturation of a protein<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v4/n9/abs/nchem.1396.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Key stabilizing elements of protein structure identified through pressure and temperature perturbation of its hydrogen bond network<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.048104\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unifying Microscopic Mechanism for Pressure and Cold Denaturations of Proteins<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp3039175\" rel=\"nofollow\">Role of Hydrophobic Hydration in Protein Stability: A 3D Water-Explicit Protein Model Exhibiting Cold and Heat Denaturation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570963911002123\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molecular mechanisms of the anomalous thermal aggregation of green fluorescent protein<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp2014836\" rel=\"nofollow\">Analysis of the Mechanism of Lysozyme Pressure Denaturation from Raman Spectroscopy Investigations, and Comparison with Thermal Denaturation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2008 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200802027/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cold- and Pressure-Induced Dissociation of Protein Aggregates and Amyloid Fibrils<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509061505\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Behavior of the Hydrophobic Effect under Pressure and Protein Denaturation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2004 - <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.238105\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reversible Temperature and Pressure Denaturation of a Protein Fragment: A Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is found that the energetics involving backbone hydrogen bonding\n  controls these shifts in protein stability almost entirely, with\n  osmolyte cosolvents simply dialing between solvent-backbone versus\n  backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, as a function of solvent quality.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2008 - <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061306.131357\" rel=\"nofollow\">Structure and Energetics of the Hydrogen-Bonded Backbone in Protein Folding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2008 - <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/8/2595.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Urea, but not guanidinium, destabilizes proteins by forming hydrogen bonds to the peptide group<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511001111\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backbone and Side-Chain Contributions in Protein Denaturation by Urea<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bip.21318/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">On the mechanism of SDS-induced protein denaturation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1995 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00014a029\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydrogen Bonds and the pH dependence of Ovomucoid Third Domain Stability<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2004 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi036106z\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of Chaotropic and Kosmotropic Cosolvents on the Pressure-Induced Unfolding and Denaturation of Proteins:?

Electric\n  pulse profile (instant charge reversal) played a very important role\n  in reducing the activities of various enzymes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Effects of high-voltage pulsed electric field (PEF) on native or\n  thermal denatured enzyme activities were studied. When PEF was applied\n  to various native enzymes, 105\u2013120% of initial enzyme activities were\n  observed after PEF treatment. It was suggested that an activation of\n  enzyme would be possible by PEF treatment. We attempted a refolding of\n  thermal denatured enzyme by using PEF. When PEF was applied to\n  denatured peroxidase, enzyme refolding was accelerated in PEF and 60%\n  of initial activity was observed after 12 kV/cm and 30 s of PEF\n  treatment although spontaneous refolding of this enzyme resulted in\n  40% of initial activity. On the other hand, when PEF was applied to\n  thermal denatured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), further PEF-induced\n  inactivation was observed. It was suggested that the influence of PEF\n  is dependent on the type of enzyme.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2014 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bem.21865/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Real-time assessment of possible electromagnetic-field-induced changes in protein conformation and thermal stability<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2007 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643806002362\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of pulsed electric fields on physicochemical properties of soybean protein isolates<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1997 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877496000520\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of high field electric pulses on the activity of selected enzymes<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2007 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304388606000738\" rel=\"nofollow\">Influence of pulsed electric field on various enzyme activities<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In halophiles, protein stability and function are maintained by\n  increased ion binding and glutamic acid content, both allowing the\n  protein inventory to compete for water at high salt. Acidophiles and\n  alkalophiles show neutral intracellular pH; proteins facing the\n  outside extremes of pH possess anomalously high contents in ionizable\n  amino acids. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>These facts suggest that globular proteins should be maximally stable\n  around room temperature. Twenty-six of these are unique, and 20 of the\n  26 are maximally stable around room temperature irrespective of their\n  structural properties, the melting temperature, or the living\n  temperatures of their source organisms. Their average temperature of\n  maximal stability is 293 ± 8 K (20 ± 8 °C).   The average energetic\n  contribution of the individual amino acids toward protein stability\n  decreases with an increase in protein size.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Analysed in terms of their effect on the protein structure, the ways\n  in which thermophilic organisms obtain relative stabilization of their\n  proteins can be classified as follows:<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>increase of compactness and better packing<\/li>\n  <li>increase of electrostatic interactions<\/li>\n  <li>additional hydrogen bonds<\/li>\n  <li>additional disulphide bridges<\/li>\n  <li>increasing hydrophobic interactions<\/li>\n  <li>protein microenvironment<\/li>\n  <li>glycosylation<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  \n  <p>The rational modification of protein stability is an important goal of\n  protein design. Protein surface electrostatic interactions are not\n  evolutionarily optimized for stability and are an attractive target\n  for the rational redesign of proteins. We show that surface charge\n  mutants can exert stabilizing effects in distinct and unanticipated\n  ways, including ones that are not predicted by existing methods, even\n  when only solvent-exposed sites are targeted. Individual mutation of\n  three solvent-exposed lysines in the villin headpiece subdomain\n  significantly stabilizes the protein, but the mechanism of\n  stabilization is very different in each case. One mutation\n  destabilizes native-state electrostatic interactions but has a larger\n  destabilizing effect on the denatured state, a second removes the\n  desolvation penalty paid by the charged residue, whereas the third\n  introduces unanticipated native-state interactions but does not alter\n  electrostatics. Our results show that even seemingly intuitive\n  mutations can exert their effects through unforeseen and complex\n  interactions.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>These results suggest that surface charge-charge interactions are\n  important for protein stability and that rational optimization of\n  charge-charge interactions on the protein surface can be a viable\n  strategy for enhancing protein stability. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>We have discovered a novel property of single-walled carbon nanotubes\n  (SWNTs)their ability to stabilize proteins at elevated temperatures\n  and in organic solvents to a greater extent than conventional flat\n  supports. Experimental results and theoretical analysis reveal that\n  the stabilization results from the curvature of SWNTs, which\n  suppresses unfavorable protein-protein lateral interactions. Our\n  results also indicate that the phenomenon is not unique to SWNTs but\n  could be extended to other nanomaterials. The protein-nanotube\n  conjugates represent a new generation of active and stable catalytic\n  materials with potential use in biosensors, diagnostics, and bioactive\n  films and other hybrid materials that integrate biotic and abiotic\n  components. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>The main chain to side chain salt bridge between the N-terminus and\n  Glu 14 was, however, found to stabilize PFRD-XC4 by 1.5 kcal mol-1.\n  The entropic cost of making a surface salt bridge involving the\n  protein's backbone is reduced, since the backbone has already been\n  immobilized upon protein folding.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2000 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165600002364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stability and stabilization of globular proteins in solution<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2002 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi012154c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximal Stabilities of Reversible Two-State Proteins<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2014 - <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02648725.1997.10647944\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enzyme Thermostabilization: the State of the Art<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/28/11337.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rational modification of protein stability by targeting surface sites leads to complicated results<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-biophys-050511-102321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disulfide Bonding in Protein Biophysics<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp111448a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Methanol Strengthens Hydrogen Bonds and Weakens Hydrophobic Interactions in Proteins \u2013 A Combined Molecular Dynamics and NMR study<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611002324\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contribution of Hydrophobic Interactions to Protein Stability<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1997 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697910421\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein thermal stability, hydrogen bonds, and ion pairs<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2005 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533916\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal stability of proteins.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2004 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein structure, stability and solubility in water and other solvents.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2000 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi992091m\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rational Modification of Protein Stability by the Mutation of Charged Surface Residues<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2006 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi0600143\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein Stability and Surface Electrostatics:?

Available space in the cell is definitely not one if it, however. Energy for copying and maintenance is a good point, but you have to keep in mind how evolution works. Bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes are usually adapted to a very specific environment in which they can reproduce rapidly. This means, they only need a small set of genes, specific for this environment and they have to reproduce very frequent, which means they are very prone to mistakes during DNA-copying. Such a mistake can lead to the death of the cell, which in this case equals the death of the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>In higher organisms however, the advantages of a bigger genome outweigh the disadvantages by far. Evolution can happen much faster because and mistake while copying does not necessarily lead to the death of the whole organism. Adaptation to a much greater variety of conditions is also necessary, e.g. when you look at plants: Their genomes are (on avarage) much bigger than the ones we mammals have, because they cannot move if the conditions around them become unpleasent. Instead, they need to find a way to adapt. This means, a big genome is in this case a fitness bonus.

A whole mammalian genome is really big, therefore kind of expensive to sequence, and is mostly non-coding DNA of questionable relevance.  Therefore you can just genotype the exact bases of interest, or maybe do exome capture, which gets you full sequence for the 1% or so of the genome that is currently annotated to be coding.

The reasons for this are different.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mostly it has to do with the viruses which cause the common cold. There is a bunch of them causing what we call a cold, including rhinoviruses, coronacviruses, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses and metapneumovirus. As much as 200 different virus serotypes are connected to this disease, alone 99 from the rhinoviridae. See the references 1-3 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype\">serotypes<\/a> means that two viruses of the same family (a rhinovirus for example) have different surface antigens on the virus and are not recognized by the same antibody. And this is what makes it difficult for the immune system. When it has learned to recognize and defeat one virus which causes a cold, it still has to learn how to do this with another (serotypically different) virus. So the adaptive immune system has to make highly specific antibodies every time it is faced with a new virus (which is of course not limited to cold viruses).<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have been infected with a virus and developed a sufficient immune reaction to develop antibodies, you are usually immune against this specific virus (with its specific serotype). Cold viruses live in communities, so when you move or travel, you will most likely encountered with different viruses, which your immune system doesn't know...<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally there is another point which adds to the problem: Mutations of the viruses. The viruses are mutating constantly (RNA viruses at high rates) which changes their appearance and also their surface molecules (which are important for the recognition through the immune system).

Null (knockout) mutations, however, have the phenotype removed, so to say. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason that you would use null rather than hypomorph mutations to do double mutant analysis is because with the hypomorph, you would still see some effect of the phenotype you are trying to have eliminated. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why do you want to eliminate a phenotype? Let's say you want to try to find the pathway for the genetic interactions between A and B. You have 2 animals you want to cross (I work with C. elegans worms, and use double mutants often). If we look at the wildtype homozygous of both animals, they will be the same. Animal 1: +;+/+;+. Animal 2: +;+/+;+. (where + denotes wildtype, and ';' means they are not linked, so the genes are independent of each other). <\/p>\n\n<p>We will use 'a' to denote null mutation A, and 'b' to denote null mutation B. <\/p>\n\n<p>Animal 1 will have mutation A. Animal 2 will have mutation B. So now Animal 1 will look like a;+/a;+, and Animal 2 will look like +;b/+;b. Notice that each locus is corresponding with itself - ie: in the region where Animal 1 is still +, Animal 2 is b, and vice versa (for null mutation 'a'). <\/p>\n\n<p>So then we cross Animal 1 with Animal 2 and get a;+/a;+ x +;b/+;b which will segregate in a 9:3:3:1 ratio (according to independent assortment of 2 independent genes - just draw a 4x4 punnet square to convince yourself). <\/p>\n\n<p>We are interested in achieving the 1/16 a;b/a;b animal (also can be noted aabb, btw). And THAT is our double mutant. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because we use a null allele, there is no chance of the wildtype phenotype \"leaking\" within our cross, giving us a false ratio or false assessment, as would be the case with a hypomorph (reduced, but not gone). <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, when talking about genes in a pathway: I think this is what your professor was referring to. When we are mapping how genes interact, and in what order, we can either have the genes interacting in redundant or sequential pathways. <\/p>\n\n<p>Redundant pathways: A -> C and B -> C. So either A or B can have an effect on C, meaning that having both is redundant, because one can do the job. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sequential pathway: A -> B -> C  OR  B -> A -> C. So both are existing in the pathway in sequence, and both are needed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just as a side note, whenever you are using double mutants to find out if your pathway is redundant or sequential, you MUST compare it to a single mutant!!! Otherwise you WILL NOT be able to tell the difference between your results. <\/p>\n\n<p>In a single mutant (A, for example), when using in a redundant pathway, you will still get phenotype C, since B is available. Just note that your C phenotype will be weaker. \nWhen you then use a double mutant, knocking out both A and B, you will see NO expression of phenotype C. The same will apply if you knock out B instead of A. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for a sequential pathway. If you use a single mutant (again, let's use A as the example) you will have no phenotype C, since A is needed to interact with B (whether upstream of downstream) in order to have an effect on C. And, if you use a double mutant (so knock out both A and B), then you will also have no expression of C, since both A and B are gone. (again, same applies if you use a B single mutant first)<\/p>\n\n<p>So, for a redundant pathway: single mutant will have C phenotype, double mutant will not have C phenotype. There IS a change!<\/p>\n\n<p>For a sequential pathway: single mutant will have no C phenotype, and double mutant will have no C phenotype. There is NO change!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you would have used a hypomorph to do these experiments, then you would probably see some percentage of C expression in your double mutant experiments, making your results inconclusive. <\/p>\n\n<p>--<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps!<\/p>\n\n<p>[source: you can find this information in any genetics textbook (in my case, since i study worms, <a href=\"http://www.wormbook.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WormBook<\/a> is a great source); I have given this information from my own experience.

Which is probably fine.  Mutations we infer from this work arise spontaneously from a similar mechanism in all organisms.  This is just ionizing radiation for the most part.  So at a first glance we still believe this.  That there are no specific mechanisms for mutation.  Since this is usually ionizing radiation we would expect that the rate would go up when there's more radiation around and it most certainly does. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of reasons that animals and humans would have a smaller rate.  Drake is including in the paper the involvement of DNA repair mechanisms in the experiment as they are intrinsic to the survival of the yeast and bacterial cases and the phage may also enjoy the benefit thereof.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In some organisms there is a lot more DNA repair possible.  So that would mitigate the mutation rate in some cases like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deinococcus radiodurans<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Metazoans and diploid organisms which undergo meiosis for sexual reproduction have other methods for reducing the number of mutations they pass on.  Meiosis and recombination will allow the removal of many mutations by competition in gametes.  Since there are two copies of each chromosome, mutations are constantly being competed against their unmutated versions as gametes.  Then eukaryotes have their own repair enzymes and conditions.  Then lastly recombining into diploids, they also show mutations less often.   <\/p>\n\n<p>For these reasons and others, the mutation rate being even across the genome does not mean that that the mutations accumulate evenly.  Mutations still tend to accumulate in regions where positive selection is operational.

These studies\n  indicate that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous\n  diseases characterized by various genetic abnormalities that lead to\n  overly aggressive T-cell responses to a subset of commensal enteric\n  bacteria. The onset and reactivation of disease are triggered by\n  environmental factors that transiently break the mucosal barrier,\n  stimulate immune responses or alter the balance between beneficial and\n  pathogenic enteric bacteria. Different genetic abnormalities can lead\n  to similar disease phenotypes; these genetic changes can be broadly\n  characterized as causing defects in mucosal barrier function,\n  immunoregulation or bacterial clearance.

Here we\n  show that consumption of a diet high in saturated (milk-derived) fat,\n  but not polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat, changes the conditions\n  for microbial assemblage and promotes the expansion of a\n  low-abundance, sulphite-reducing pathobiont, Bilophila wadsworthia2.\n  This was associated with a pro-inflammatory T helper type 1 (TH1)\n  immune response and increased incidence of colitis in genetically\n  susceptible Il10−/−, but not wild-type mice. These effects are\n  mediated by milk-derived-fat-promoted taurine conjugation of hepatic\n  bile acids, which increases the availability of organic sulphur used\n  by sulphite-reducing microorganisms like B. wadsworthia. When mice\n  were fed a low-fat diet supplemented with taurocholic acid, but not\n  with glycocholic acid, for example, a bloom of B. wadsworthia and\n  development of colitis were observed in Il10−/− mice. Together these\n  data show that dietary fats, by promoting changes in host bile acid\n  composition, can markedly alter conditions for gut microbial\n  assemblage, resulting in dysbiosis that can perturb immune\n  homeostasis. The data provide a plausible mechanistic basis by which\n  Western-type diets high in certain saturated fats might increase the\n  prevalence of complex immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel\n  disease in genetically susceptible hosts.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v487/n7405/full/nature11225.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dietary-fat-induced taurocholic acid promotes pathobiont expansion and colitis in Il10−/− mice<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The pathogenesis of IBS seems to be multifactorial, with the following\n  factors playing a central role in the pathogenesis of IBS:\n  heritability and genetics, dietary/intestinal microbiota, low-grade\n  inflammation, and disturbances in the neuroendocrine system (NES) of\n  the gut<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468846/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Irritable bowel syndrome: Diagnosis and pathogenesis<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2014 - <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10620-014-3299-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melatonin Regulation as a Possible Mechanism for Probiotic (VSL#3) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized Double-Blinded Placebo Study<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2012 - <a href=\"http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/303/7/G775\" rel=\"nofollow\">Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Methods, Mechanisms, and Pathophysiology.

You will need some specially cultivated yeast, baker's yeast is generally not recommended since it might produce a lot of unwanted (and probably bad tasting) side products.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the fermentation itself you need some (very) clean vessels in which the process can take place. These should be from a material which is not corrosive, as the vinegar would otherwise react with the vessel. Food-grade plastic, glass or stainless steel should be ok.<\/p>\n\n<p>To have the reaction take place, the process need oxygen, otherwise the reaction will stop at the step of ethanol. This is also why acoholic fermentation is always sealed against the air, to avoid the oxidation of the alcohol the acetic acid. A cheese cloth will leave oxygen in, but keep insects and other contaminations out. If you need to filter the vinegar at the end of the process, a standard coffeefilter is good enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following step by step directions come from this <a href=\"http://www.pickyourown.org/AppleCiderVinegarRecipe.php\">website<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Step 1 - Make or buy your apple cider or apple juice<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Apple juice or apple cider is the starting point for making apple\n  cider vinegar. You can make your own, or buy it ready made, fresh,\n  bottled or frozen.  You can use a mechanical or steam juicer to\n  produce the juice / cider. To make your own juice (which is the same\n  as plain unfermented apple cider), see this page. Keep in mind that\n  you want to select sweet apples, like Fuji, Delicious, Mutsu, Gala,\n  etc. Green, unripe and unsweet apples (like Granny Smith) do not have\n  enough sugar to make good cider vinegar. Tips about selecting apples:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Apples used for cider don't have to be flawless. They do, however,\n  have to be free from spoilage. You can use blemished apples and small\n  sized apples. You can mix apple varieties together or use all one\n  variety. The only rule is to cut out any spoilage areas on otherwise\n  good apples. Spoiled areas will cause the juice to ferment too rapidly\n  and will ruin the cider. Don't use apples that appear brown, decayed\n  or moldy. Apples should be firm and ripe. Green, undermature apples\n  cause a flat flavor when juiced. The best cider comes from a blend of\n  sweet, tart and aromatic apple varieties. A bushel of apples yields\n  about 3 gallons of juice. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Step 2 - Make your starter yeast<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Adding yeast to activate fermentation is not essential, but will speed\n  up the process and can produce a higher quality. Special cultivated\n  yeasts are available for this purpose at wine-making shops and\n  biological labs but bread yeasts are not recommended. To make a\n  starter, crumble one cake of yeast into one quart of cider and mix.\n  This makes enough starter for 5 gallons of cider; double the recipe\n  proportionately when making more. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Steps 3 - Making Alcohol and Acetic Acid<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Pour all of the juice or cider into one or more containers to about\n  three-quarters capacity; do not close the lids on the containers. \n  Instead, cover the openings with cheesecloth secured with a rubber\n  band or string. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Step 4 - Store out of direct light, but some place with constant temperature<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Stir the mixtures daily, making sure the cheesecloth is put back in\n  place. Keep the containers away from direct sunlight and maintain the\n  temperature at 60 to 80 degrees F. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Step 5 - Keep stirring daily, monitoring and tasting for the next 3 to 4 weeks<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Full fermentation will take about 3 to 4 weeks. Near the end of this\n  period, you should notice a vinegar-like smell. Taste samples daily\n  until the desired strength is reached. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Step 4 - Filter Mother of vinegar<\/p>\n  \n  <p>When the vinegar is fully fermented, filter the liquid through several\n  layers of fine cheesecloth or filter paper\u2014a coffee filter works well\n  for this. This removes the mother of vinegar, shown at right,\n  preventing further fermentation or spoilage of the product. Mother of\n  vinegar is completely harmless and the surrounding vinegar does not\n  have to be discarded because of it. It can be filtered out using a\n  coffee filter, used to start a bottle of vinegar, or simply left in\n  and ignored. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Step 6 - Done! Storing Your Vinegar<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The vinegar is now ready for storage in separate, capped containers.\n  Stored vinegar will stay in excellent condition almost indefinitely if\n  it is pasteurized. To pasteurize, heat the vinegar before pouring it\n  into sterilized bottles, or bottle, then place in a hot water bath. In\n  both cases, the temperature of the vinegar must reach at least 140\n  degrees F to pasteurize the product, and should not exceed 160 degrees\n  F. Use a cooking thermometer to ensure the correct temperature is met.\n  Cool the containers and store at room temperature out of direct\n  sunlight.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":23679,"question_id":21410,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21410/fermentation-to-acetic-acid","last_activity_date":1415054531,"creation_date":1410969421,"answer_count":1,"title":"Fermentation to acetic acid","body":"<p>How much time is needed for the fermentation to acetic acid production cycle, and the conversion of apple vinegar in a sealed container incubated at 37 °C? \nShould be in the fully closed?\nWhat is right yeast?\nI do it with powder, grated apple in a plastic soda bottle and I add a few peas and a slice of bread.

If your sample is large (a large population) this deviation will be small, and if your sample is small the effect will be substantial. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the same process as flipping a coin.

The 200 survivors are those that wear green shirt\u2026 This is quite suprising!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic Drift<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The same logic applies for genetic drift. Genetic drift is caused by events that modifies the reproductive success of individuals in a random way (independently of their genotype). We usually referred to this as random sampling. At each generation individuals are randomly chosen to reproduce and some genotypes might have a greater chance to be chosen than others. Genetic drift pushes the frequency of allele slightly away from what would be predicted. According to wright-Fisher, the frequency of alleles (of a bi-allelic gene) in a halpoid population (to make it easier) in the next time step is given by:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$p' = \\frac{p \\cdot WA}{p \\cdot WA + (1-p) \\cdot Wa}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $p$ is there frequency of an allele at time = $t$ and $p'$ is the frequency at time = $t+1$. $WA$ is the fitness of the genotype which frequency is $p$ and $Wa$ is the fitness of the genotype which frequnecy is $1-p$. If the population is infinite, the predictions of this equation are exactly correct.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if we say that meteorites fall and half of the individual get killed. The probability of getting killed by a meteorite obviously does not depend on genetic predisposition, it is a question of chance! If you look at a population of 1 million of individuals, half of them having the genotype $A$, the other half having the genotype $a$. It is very unlikely that more than 60% of all individuals that get killed are of a the same genotype. Therefore, the meteorites won't change much the frequency of the genotypes. IF you look at a population of 4 individuals 2 are $a$ and 2 are $A$, 2 of them get killed by a meteorite. Well, you have a probably of one half that the two survivors are of the same genotype and that the genotypes frequency would have changed drastically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic drift refers to these changes in allele frequency which are due to random events (such as meteorites) and the strength of genetic drift indeed depends on the population size for probabilistic reasons.
