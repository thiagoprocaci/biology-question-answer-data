This electrical activity may repel sharks by over-stimulating their lateral line organ. However, the effectiveness of lanthanides as shark repellent depends on many factors. For example, hungry sharks, or sharks engaged in a feeding frenzy may simply ignore the stimulus altogether. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nRare earth metals are Lanthanides - metals with a <a href=\"https://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/activity.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">low electronegativity<\/a>. Metals with low electronegativity are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropositive_shark_repellent\" rel=\"nofollow\">electropositive<\/a>. Electropositive metals (EPMs) react vigorously with water when immersed and generate electrical potentials that are thought to overstimulate the sharks\u2019 highly sensitive electroreceptors, the <a href=\"https://antonyhall.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/electro-sensitivity-in-sharks/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>ampullae of Lorenzini<\/em><\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Many electropositive metals fall in groups I and II of the <a href=\"http://www.ptable.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">periodic table<\/a> and explosively react with water. Examples include sodium and lithium. The <a href=\"http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Inorganic_Chemistry/Descriptive_Chemistry/f-Block_Elements/The_Lanthanides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lanthanides<\/a>, on the other hand, contain some less reactive elements. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is in fact a considerable <strong>body of primary literature<\/strong> on the <strong>use of EPMs to deter sharks<\/strong>, because the by-catch of sharks is a recognized problem of modern fishery. However, much of this literature shows very mixed results of EPMs, and therefore I have based my (second :-) answer attempt on a recent review article by <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1749-4877.12095/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hart and Collin (2015)<\/a>, which is available on-line and cites some fifteen primary research articles on the topic: <\/p>\n\n<p>EPMs are primarily intended as a mechanism to reduce shark bycatch and catch depredation in longline fisheries, without affecting the catch of non-electrosensitive target teleost fishes. As you indicate in the question, EPMs can be formed into shapes that are easily attached to a fishing line or hook. <\/p>\n\n<p>Early tests in the laboratory with captive sharks showed that several EPMs (including magnesium and rare-earth lanthanide elements such as cerium, lanthanum, neodymium and praseodymium) were effective in repelling various shark species. However, more recently, several studies showed no such repellent effects other species of shark, and it was shown that <strong>aversive behavior was highly dependent on various factors<\/strong> such as duration of <strong>food deprivation<\/strong> prior to testing. Specifically, <strong>hungry sharks ignored the EPM<\/strong>, especially when feeding in groups (feeding frenzies).<\/p>\n\n<p>The results of field trials with EPMs were also mixed, with some studies showing a <strong>reduction in the catch rate<\/strong> of various shark species, while other studies showed <strong>no such effect<\/strong>. The authors of the review article summarize a range of factors that may influence the efficacy of EPMs in repelling sharks, including the <strong>type of EPM<\/strong> used, the relative <strong>sensitivity of the electrosensory system<\/strong>, <strong>shark density<\/strong> and <strong>competition<\/strong>, <strong>hunger level<\/strong>, and differences in <strong>feeding ecology<\/strong>. Other impediments to large-scale adoption of EPM technology by commercial fisheries include the relatively high cost of the rare-earth metals (although magnesium may represent a cheaper alternative), potential toxicity to other marine animals, and the fact that they dissolve rapidly in seawater and, therefore, must be replaced frequently. The use of EPMs for personal shark deterrent devices is also hampered by the limited effective range (&lt;85 cm) of the electrical field they generate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, for use in scuba dive gear a rechargeable battery-powered capacitor-discharge unit connected to two or four electrodes is sufficient as shark repellent.

You say 187 (not sure why, <code>18*11=198<\/code>) but the truth is that not all H1s are the same.  The different subtypes constantly mutate, so one H1N1 may not be the same as another H1N1.  There are hundreds upon hundreds of flu types, constantly changing.  And that's not even accounting for type B viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you make a vaccine, you need a certain amount of protein.  The major <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215817\" rel=\"nofollow\">quadrivalent vaccine study<\/a> used 15Âµg of protein of each strain.  The more protein you put in, the bigger the vaccine, the <strong>more it hurts<\/strong>, and the more likely the body is to have a <strong>significant negative reaction<\/strong>.  You'd have to test all of them as well - the FDA doesn't usually work on a \"three is safe, four is safe, so hundreds is safe\" principle.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plus, you have to MAKE all that protein.  We're not very good at making enough for the tri- or quadrivalent vaccines now, much less hundreds or thousands of times more.  We simply don't have the capacity for that level of production.  Even if we could, it's not likely that immunity to all strains would take.  Besides, erradication is unlikely because there are large animal flu reservoirs (avian and swine, most famously) that can and will jump over to humans.  That's the piece everyone forgets about smallpox - with no animal reservoir, it was easy to eradicate.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's not to say the cause is lost.  Intense research <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ScienceResearch/ucm353397.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">has begun<\/a> on universal flu antibodies, and it looks <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055435\" rel=\"nofollow\">somewhat promising<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34800,"question_id":34777,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1433189024}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34777/why-does-flu-vaccination-only-work-against-specific-strains","last_activity_date":1433189208,"creation_date":1433114742,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why does flu vaccination only work against specific strains?","body":"<p>I was wondering why the flu vaccination doesn't protect us from all different types of flu.

I will sum up a few reasons to build the eyes and ears into a solid, rotational structure and <em>not<\/em> in the torso:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The eyes are hardwired to see <em>depth<\/em>. The most important depth cue is <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24589/how-does-the-eye-know-whether-to-focus-further-out-or-nearer-in-order-to-bring-a\"><strong>retinal disparity<\/strong><\/a>, which is defined by a slight difference in the positioning of the field of view on both the retinas. This retinal disparity varies between people because it is dependent on the <em>exact distance<\/em> between the eyes. Hence, babies must <em>learn<\/em> to judge depth, as it is subjective perception deducted from a <em>flat retinal surface<\/em>. Hence, you want the two eyes to be contained in a solid, unmoldable structure and not in a bodily structure that is subject to change due to adipose tissue (belly) or breathing (rib cage).<\/li>\n<li>The ears are hardwired to sense <em>direction<\/em>. The auditory nervous system does this by <strong><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30571/are-unilaterally-deaf-people-able-to-determine-where-sound-comes-from/30587#30587\">measuring microsecond-delays<\/a><\/strong> between the sound arriving in both ears to sense the azimuth. Again, along the same reasoning as for the eyes,  the ears must be contained in a solid structure.<\/li>\n<li>Directional hearing is less well-developed in the vertical plane, and when a sound comes from behind it may be hard to figure out exactly where it comes from. Also, pure-tone sounds are hard to distinguish in terms of elevation. Simply turning your head helps to re-locate the source to the side, or simply being able to <em>see<\/em> it. If you have to move the whole body, you lose time and effort. In case of a <em>T. rex<\/em> running in attack modus from behind, it means the difference of life and death.   <\/li>\n<li>Eating needs a mouth.

One proposed form is a simple wormlike animal with some form of eyelike structures, a segmented body with internal organs, and a centralized nervous system.

Living in the water, fish need to be streamlined, so a long, narrow body plan works well.  Given this, and adding in the often limited visibility underwater, it makes sense to put the mouth towards the front, and sense organs near them, since they get to the food first.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This body plan got inherited by the descendants of that first fish to crawl out on land.  It would require a major re-organization of the genes to get a radically different plan, and there was no great evolutionary pressure towards some different one.  In many cases the mouth &amp; eyes in the front works best - for predators, of course, but also think of a giraffe trying to browse on trees if its eyes were near its stomach.  For most land vertebrates, food goes directly to the mouth.  Only a few types - humans, elephants, and so on - have anything like hands to get food at a distance.  (And if you look at an elephant, they do seem partway to a mouth near the stomach plan.)<\/p>\n\n<p>If you think about creatures like the starfish, that have a central mouth, \"brain\", and sense organs, their food tends to be sessile.  The starfish commonly crawls on top of its prey, and everts its stomach to digest it, so their the radially symmetric body plan works well.<\/p>\n\n<p>*I don't know that much about arthropod evolution, but am guessing similar logic applies.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34787,"question_id":34747,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34747/why-dont-most-animals-have-heads-in-the-middle-of-their-bodies","last_activity_date":1433138187,"creation_date":1433050625,"answer_count":4,"title":"Why don't most animals have \"heads\" in the middle of their bodies?","body":"<p>For example, humans.

Then the fat metabolism accelerates because gluconeogenesis is not enough. This is when you get into a state of ketosis(this can also happen in bodybuilders since increased muscle = increased fat metabolism). This ketosis causes fast weight loss from not just water like a lot of other diets but also from fat. This fat then eventually depletes and it metabolizes protein exclusively(during all this time it does metabolise some protein). However that can't continue forever even if the amino acids get reused over and over again because some are used to produce ATP. Thus you eventually would die from starvation with obese people surviving longer than underweight people.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway as far as exercise assuming that you start off obese, getting your body into a state of ketosis makes your performance even better than on just glucose alone after a while of adjusting to fat metabolism since 1 molecule of palmatic acid(16 carbon fatty acid) produces 106 ATP compared to 32 ATP for 1 glucose molecule so your muscles can go longer without being exhausted. Theoretically someone who is 50 pounds overweight could exercise 24/7 for several days if he/she is in a state of ketosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a reference to the low glycogen and increased muscle performance:\n<a href=\"http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/glen12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/glen12.htm<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As to why it is 106 ATP it is because each NADH produces 2.5 ATP and each FADH2 produces 1.5 ATP and because of the activation step using 2 ATP just like how NADH transport from cytoplasm to mitochondria takes 2 ATP, 1 per NADH in glycolysis.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34743,"question_id":31293,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1433105071}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31293/do-muscles-still-hold-glycogen-reserves-if-there-is-no-carbohydrate-input","last_activity_date":1433105071,"creation_date":1428870962,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do muscles still hold glycogen reserves if there is no carbohydrate input","body":"<p>Afaik skeletal muscles take glucose from the blood to store it localy as glycogen, to be used in the case of intensive exercise. <\/p>\n\n<p>Does this still happen<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>if the calorie input is exclusively made up of fats and proteins?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>while fasting / starving?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I know that muscles can run on fatty acids and ketone bodies.\nAnd that the liver can create glucose by gluconeogenesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>But is this \"backup\"-glucose still used to refill the glycogen stores in the skeletal muscles in those two respective cases?

Consider the human field of view, which is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly 180<sup>o<\/sup> wide<\/a> in the horizontal plane. Covering your eyes and obscuring, say, half of the field will not substantially improve visual acuity, because it simply blocks half of the retinal surface from receiving light - it <em>does not double the retinal surface devoted to the field of view<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, I think it is not so much the bat's projected beam that matters, it is the incoming echo that matters. Note that objects such as a tree may scatter the sound that is reflected back, so the projected beam of 40<sup>o<\/sup> may be a dramatic underestimation of the chaotic signals bouncing back to the bat. What can they do to improve spatial detail in the received acoustic field of view?<\/p>\n\n<p>Bats may <strong>increase the pulse repetition rate<\/strong> when they are approaching a target. Hence, they basically build a map by sampling the environment multiple times. Sampling frequencies may exceed 50 Hz (<a href=\"http://www.biolbull.org/content/114/1/10.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grinnell and Griffin, 1985<\/a>). For example, imagine you are blindfolded and allowed to scan an object with your fingers. Scanning it multiple times will definitely help you to mentally reconstruct the image. Indeed, bats can <strong>assemble information about echo delay changes over time<\/strong>, enabling them to <strong>temporally integrate information of the auditory scene<\/strong>. Moreover, they can <strong>change the spectral content of their calls<\/strong> that may help in echolocation <a href=\"http://www.batlab.dk/pubs/01Moss.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Moss &amp; Surlykke, 2001)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, to conclude with a personal thought - <em>I think<\/em> that <strong>bats must <em>learn<\/em> to decode complex echo profiles<\/strong>. For example, a chaotic huge blob of echo with low-echo efficiency (lots of sound is absorbed) that only changes when <em>the bat moves<\/em> is probably a tree. A big blob with a large echo-efficiency (a lot of sound comes back) with well-defined edges that only changes when the bat moves is likely a human structure or a rock.

As Koustav Pal mentions in his comment, many such traits are multi-allelic (i.e. determined by multiple regions of the genome), and are therefore more complex than first appear; eye-colour can change over time, and there are many more complexities that do not fit into the simple \"blue\", \"brown\", \"green/hazel\" categories [<a href=\"http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mytheyecolor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>].

Luckily, the bank employee had seen this phenomenon many times before, and she explained to me that the standard computer keypads have a different numerical layout than ATM machines.

To achieve motor learning, the central nervous system is believed to use internal models that predict the mechanical dynamics necessary to execute a task.

This map is basically unique for the objects that we have learned to interact with. Because we routinely use our hands to interact with a remarkably diverse variety of mechanical systems, the ability to learn and recall internal memories is thought to be a fundamental property of the motor system (<a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/1/409.full\">Shadmehr &amp; Brashers-Krug, 1997)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/1/409.full\">Shadmehr &amp; Brashers-Krug, <em>J Neurosci<\/em> (1997); <strong>17<\/strong>(1): 409-19<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":34673,"question_id":34672,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1432898424}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34672/what-kind-of-memory-is-keyboard-keypad-memory","last_activity_date":1432898424,"creation_date":1432868986,"answer_count":1,"title":"What kind of memory is \"keyboard/keypad memory\"?","body":"<p>I work in IT and I have observed many people who cannot remember their iPhone passwords or computer passwords off the top of their head.

Here are some issues:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>some bears decided<\/code>. Evolution is not directed. There is no conscious decision from any species (except humans, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics\" rel=\"nofollow\">eugenics<\/a>) on how to evolve.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>as far as I know humans are the only animals that don't live instinctively<\/code>. I am not sure there is a common definition of the word \"instinctive\". But I very much think that the vast majority of people would suggest definitions that forces us to accept that humans behave instinctively. And if the definition would accept that human can sometimes not behave instinctively, then the definition will very likely accept that some animals behave instinctively.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><code>why they would 'evolve' to eat only bamboo<\/code>.

It is possible for example that there is inter-species competition in the wild for access to prey.

Once, pandas had evolved some features of herbivorous species, they would get stuck there and not be able to get back to a meant based diet (stuck onto a local optima on the fitness landscape). There might be many different explanations involving patterns of competition, parasites, sexual selection, etc...

Some viruses sit on surfaces (or infected persons) \"waiting\" for someone to touch and take them up, this is called smear infection. Other viruses are airborn inside of small droplets distributed by coughing or sneezing. These are inhaled and can then cause a new infection. Other viruses are transmitted through our body fluids (blood, semen) and either need a wound or can be transmitted sexually (for example Herpes or HIV). Other viruses are transmitted by animals which bite humans (Dengue and rabies would be examples here). Have a look into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_%28medicine%29\">Wikipedia<\/a> for more details and examples.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally viruses are produced in vast numbers by their hosts with most viral particles never reaching a new host. This strategy helps a lot to transmit further.s<\/p>\n\n<p>For entering the nucleus (which is an obstacle) the viruses use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pore\">nuclear pore complex<\/a> (NPC). Depending on what virus tries to enter the nucleus, different strategies are used. Some viruses are too big and release their DNA through the NPC into the nucleus, while others can pass through and some get stuck inside and release their DNA/RNA at this point.

We can't say for sure. Darwin implied, even a peaceful meadow is full of starving ravenous animals clinging to survival. There is no real time for luxury. If food is there, they eat it. Many animals don't even get full the same way we do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Scarcity of Literature<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The problem lies in that there is no body of literature around animal eating times since animals seldom have enough food in their natural environment to monitor any regularity. If you want specific questions on a particular species for optimum feeding times, I would recommend opening another question as lab animals do have recommended diets.

After this the birds only have an opportunistic approach to feeding which is enough to satisfy their energy need, and they spend more energy on pruning, calling for potential mates and engaging in territorial battles. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many primates engage in collective feeding sessions where they as a group travel to a known area rich with food where they spend a couple of hours before they retreat back to a different location for socializing and digesting the food. One reason for this behaviour can be that there is a high risk of predation at these food-rich areas, as the predators learn that these places are frequently visited by prey.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Feline predators on the savannah are usually concentrating their hunting in the night as the darkness gives them an advantage of stealth and surprise.

I highly recommend this site and encourage not only consumption of data but also to engage in comments. \n   As someone that has been doing drug to genome matching a couple pieces of advice. DNA based alterations are the best evidence to use for matching. If you do RNA be a little bit more cautious of matching based on 'is a target' mechanism. So rank DNA based changes above RNA. Additionally, just start with drug targets as place holders but try to acquire information on alteration as it relates to drug response. So alterations in a drug target could be (and often) are passengers and not drivers and in this case will not respond to drug. Frequency in other tumors and mutations in important domains are good guides for triaging variants like this. Also, the information on the disease and the mutations is important. If a drug variant mutation is observed in one disease there maybe mechanisms intrinsic to another tumor type that would preclude acting on drug to variant association in the different tumor type. Lastly, drug mechanism is something to take into account. Certain drugs that hit the same target do so but in different mechanisms that may preclude them being given in the context of particular mutations. \nGood luck in your endeavors.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34647,"question_id":793,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/793/looking-for-a-cancer-drug-target-database-to-guide-sequencing-of-patient-tumor-d","last_activity_date":1432824119,"creation_date":1327412110,"answer_count":2,"title":"Looking for a cancer drug target database to guide sequencing of patient tumor DNA","body":"<p>I have a question I would like to pose to the community. I have recently received access to a bench-top ion torrent DNA sequencer. Our idea is to use this machine to sequence the DNA from patient\u2019s tumors in order to guide treatment options. My job is to identify a list of all currently used anti-neoplastic drugs along with their known targets (i.e., specific genes and mutations) and accession numbers. I would like to put these data in a table in which each row corresponds to a different drug.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, a row in the table might read (column names are indicated in brackets): [disease] breast cancer, [drug] trastuzumab, [drug target] HER2/neu receptor, [gene] ERBB2, [location] chr17:37844393-37884915, [mutation type] amplification, [accession number] ENSG00000141736. The pathologists would then be able to use this database in order to select appropriate genes for sequencing whenever they receive a tumor specimen. If the patient\u2019s tumor had an amplified ERBB2 gene, they could be given trastuzumab.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently our study is in pre-planning stages (i.e., we won\u2019t actually be testing this on patients any time soon). I would appreciate it if anyone could give me on advice on how to go about creating such a database. I am aware of online databases including COSMIC, Sanger's Cancer Gene Census, and the Potential Drug Target Database (PDTD), but they don\u2019t have everything that I\u2019m looking for.

Some drugs will have to be in several categories at once(I'm lookin at you anthracyclines) Dose-dependent mutagens(cisplatin), growth-dependent mutagens(fluorouracil), topoisomerase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, microtubule inhibitors, retinoid signaling, immune adjuvants, and then 'misc'. <\/p>\n\n<p>Alkylating agents and platinum-containing drugs like cisplatin directly damage DNA, while there are other drugs(methotrexate,fluorouracil) destroy or damage DNA by pretending to be nucleotides and breaking things that way. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anthracyclines bind into DNA strands damaging it, directly create free radicals, disable topoisomerase II, and displace histones.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are the topoisomerase inhibitors which prevent cell growth by preventing DNA from being unwound for replication.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a fairly diverse(chemically) class of 'mitotic inhibitors' that screw up microtubule formation or proper microtubule dissolution, any of which prevents mitosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sunitinib blocks tyrosine kinases, which are involved in blood vessel formation(and nerve formation and some other things). Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are more specific to vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) receptors, but most tyrosine kinases target more or less specifically VEGFR and related receptors.

Interferon-alpha, imidazoquinoline, et cetera.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the miscellaneous category:  Bortezomib, a short peptide that interferes with proper protein degradation. L-asparaginase slows all protein production by destroying asparagine, an amino acid.

You will be able to put in TSGs and get back the freq of mutations. They may also have information on stage so might be possible to filter for only those samples. There are also a couple of text-mining resources that you can ask queries through pubmed to get back gene lists or to link gene lists. One tool is Glad4U (search this name in google) which allows you to type a query such as: \"tumor suppressor AND early stage NSCLC\" and it will return a ranked list of genes. Ranking is based on co-citation. However, one must check the returned list to make sure the genes returned are TSGs. A listing of putative TSGs can be found here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Fiy10E\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/1Fiy10E<\/a>. The second resource is CoCiter v2.0. On the Gene-Term search you can rank the lists of TSGs against search terms and it will return a ranking of the TSGs most associated with your search term.

Sterility is often\n  attributed to the different number of chromosomes the two species\n  have, for example donkeys have 62 chromosomes, while horses have 64\n  chromosomes, and mules and hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules,\n  hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot\n  produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure\n  prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is\n  disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However,\n  fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the\n  father.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>1) The sterility of hybrids prevents interspecific gene exchange and is necessary in case the hybrid has odd number of total chromosomes (the hybridized species has odd and even pairs of chromosomes individually), where equal meiotic division would not be possible, and is also necessary to avoid sex determination problems that may arise from such hybridizations genetically. <strong>What is the molecular (genetic) reason behind the sterility?<\/strong> In other words, why is the expression of primary sexual organs and its further proliferation to effect reproduction not possible, although the genes required for it are already present in the hybrids? Is this due to epigenetic mechanisms or is the reason inherent in the hybrid nature of the genome?   <\/p>\n\n<p>2) This might probably sound a bit naive, but <strong>why are these hybrids viable?<\/strong> They have 2 non-homologous haploid pairs of chromosomes which have a huge variety(compared to two homologous pairs) of different non-allelic genes. Why are all the essential functions not hindered by the presence of such <em>considerably<\/em> unrelated set of chromosomes?   <\/p>\n\n<p>Probably related to the question is the fact that certain <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/allopolyploidy\" rel=\"nofollow\">allopolyploids<\/a> are viable and become an entirely new species, but others are not. Is it because here are 2 sets of each combining species' chromosomes (and hence allowing proper meiotic pairing) or is there some other reason pertaining to the nature of the combined sets of chromosome?<\/p>\n","question_id":11119,"tags":["genetics","gene-expression","sex","hybridization"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":363,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1432818141},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b6068828c6314b9749c6996adefa774?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":15954,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15954/pola","reputation":21,"display_name":"Pola"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":34614,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432899030,"comment_id":55871,"body":"I just reviewed an edit which seemed to be updating the original answer, but was not by the original poster.

In order to verify that a \"housekeeping\" gene X is constant across your samples, you must assume that the $C_t$ values themselves are actually a valid measure, so that you can assess the expression level of X directly.

A reasonable assumption I think is that the total mRNA pool is constant; this underlies most normalization methods used in microarray or RNA-seq analysis. For RT-PCR, this assumption can be tested using cDNA dyes, as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16925017\" rel=\"nofollow\">in this paper<\/a>.
