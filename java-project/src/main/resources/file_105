The modification is actually generated by E3 ubiquitin ligase, of which there are ~400-800 in the mammalian cell and the main source of specificity in the UPS (E2 ~40 and only 1 or 2 E1).<\/p>\n\n<p>Ubiquitin gets its name from ubiquitous, meaning found everywhere. It's a 76 amino acid molecule that modifies proteins at lysine residues. Monoubiquitination can act as a signalling molecule whereas polyubiquitination leads to degradation. Ubiquitin is first activated via an ATP-dependent pathway to create a high energy thioester with E1. This is transthiolated to E2 and finally E3 allows the addition to the target protein. So really, your question is how E3 ubiquitin ligase recognises its target. <a href=\"http://jcs.biologists.org/content/125/3/531.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2>E3 ligases<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are 3 classes of <a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC6/3/2/19.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">E3 ligases<\/a>, according to whether they contain a RING, U-box or HECT domain. These domains are responsible for either directly catalysing the addition of ubiquitin or simply facilitating another E3 ligase to do so. RING and RING-like domains are by far the most common (&lt;600). Exactly how these domains mediate the transmission of ubiquitin is not clear, but it can be via an E3-Ub intermediate or directly from E2 to the target. The domains are relatively standardised, due to the fact they bind to E2 proteins, which contain less diversity than target proteins. However, it's the combination of the E2 and substrate binding domains that generates the selection. <a href=\"http://essays.biochemistry.org/bsessays/041/0015/bse0410015.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2>Target recognition<\/h2>\n\n<p>So how does the target come into all of this? Each E3 ligase recognises a specific sequence on the target protein due to it's own conformation and signal sequence creating a unique interface full of intermolecular interactions- just like any protein recognises any other protein. However, although individual cases vary, the tight control primarily comes from post translational modifications on the target. Phosphorylation in particular is common in signalling and may allow E3 to bind, inducing degradation of the target. I'll use some examples to demonstrate this point, but note that every case will be different.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740000057X\" rel=\"nofollow\">c-Cbl<\/a> (E3) recognises activated receptor tyrosine kinases and ZAP 70/Syk kinases (target) by binding a phosphotyrosine sequence through its tyrosine kinase binding domain (containing SH2 domain).

Whilst there are many different types, chaperones generally work by isolating the misfolded protein and undergoing a series of binding release steps, triggered by hydrolysis of ATP. The protein can still be released unfolded, and the cell will continually try to isolate it for refolding. However, certain chaperones form a complex with the proteasome, and can recruit other UPS components. The choice to give up on refolding appears to be a stochastic process, and will depend on the concentration of the appropriate chaperones. Misfolded proteins tend to have significant regions of exposed hydrophobic residues, and E3 ligases are therefore likely to recognise this less specifically than the degradation pathway described above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Relevant sources include <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3039444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022282812003641\" rel=\"nofollow\">chaperones<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is that there is no standard recognition sequence in E3 to know which protein to target, the binding needs to be diverse in order to give the control the cell needs. That means it could be anything, but each E3 is likely to be relatively specific for its target, and is often controlled by other post translation modifications on the substrate. Misfolded proteins can be recognised and degraded due to the association of the UPS with chaperones.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're really interested, you can download <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3RTR\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> file and open it in something like <a href=\"http://www.pymol.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PyMol<\/a> to actually see the ligase ready to transfer ubiquitin.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9136,"question_id":9053,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1373071331}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9053/how-does-ubiquitin-recognize-misfolded-proteins","last_activity_date":1373071331,"creation_date":1372709963,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does ubiquitin recognize misfolded proteins?","body":"<p>Misfolded proteins are tagged by ubiquitin and then are destroyed by proteasomes.

In principle a single pol III molecule could produce the entire leading strand copy of the template.<\/p>\n\n<p>The lagging strand is, as you say, initiated at multiple RNA primers. The enzyme that extends these primers is pol I. As polI  extends a primer it creates an Okazaki fragment (i.e. this is not an alternative name for the primer itself). Eventually the pol I will encounter the 5' end of another RNA primer. At this point the 5'>3' exonuclease activity of the pol I comes into play and removes the primer, replacing it with DNA. The pol I will probably also degrade some of the DNA that has been added to that primer by another pol I, resynthesising it as it goes. This is so-called \"nick tranlation\" since as the pol I moves along the template it moves a nick in the new strand as it goes. pol I is not a very processive enzyme however and will fall off, leaving the nick to be sealed by DNA  ligase.<\/p>\n\n<p>The leading strand does require a primer, and in most cases this is an RNA laid down by the initiation complex at the origin of replication.

He proposed that modern species were all descended from ancestral species, and that evolution proceeded by natural selection. He believed that evolution proceeded gradually by an accretion of small changes (gradualism). The origins of hereditary change were, of course, unknown to Darwin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mendel\u2019s work (published in 1865) was rediscovered in 1900, and gave rise to a school of thought referred to as mutationism.  Mutationist theories emphasised the importance of single factor changes with large effects, and placed these \u201cleaps forward\u201d at the centre of the mechanism for the generation of new species. This was in contrast to the biometricians who argued, in the Darwinian tradition, that natural selection acted on populations in which there was continuous variation. Extreme mutationists believed that continuous variation within a species had no relevance to the evolution of new species. Their view was that within a species most genes were fixed (100% wild-type allele), and that only mutations could create new species (\u2018hopeful monsters\u2019). T.H. Morgan, for example, was a strong proponent of the mutationist theory, so this wasn't some minor controversy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sewall Wright joined the laboratory of W.E.Castle as an assistant in 1912, when he was 23. Starting with black and white hooded rats (white rats with black \u2018hoods\u2019) they instigated breeding programmes and showed that they could progress gradually, through a number of generations, towards all white or all black rats. The importance of this work was that it demonstrated that there was underlying genetic variation within this strain of rats that could be acted upon by selection (selective breeding) resulting in  gradual changes in coat colour. This provided strong evidence for the gradualist school.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the 1930s the modern synthesis began to emerge, which combined mutationist and gradualist ideas: natural selection acts upon populations (gene frequencies etc.) but mutation provides the raw material that creates new variations in the population. Key to the acceptance of the modern synthesis was the development of a mathematical treatment of population genetics. This led to the current view of phenotypic  traits influenced by multiple loci, with natural populations harbouring genetic variability which can be acted upon by selective forces. We have all accepted this and so of course it is difficult to think ourselves into the controversies that existed in genetics at the beginning of the twentieth century.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.animal-science.org/content/46/5/1192.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is an article<\/a> in which Sewall Wright refers briefly to his work with Castle, placing it in historical context. It also describes subsequent work with guinea pigs. This is a quotation from the article which underscores what I have written:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From assisting Prof. Castle, I learned at firsthand the efficacy of mass selection in changing permanently a character subject merely to quantitative variability. Because of this and a distaste for miracles in science, I started with full acceptance of Darwin's contention that evolution depends mainly on quantitative variability rather than on favorable major mutations. Thus, I have assumed that species are typically heteroallelic in tens of thousands of loci in which the leading alleles differ only slightly in effect, a situation that is maintained in a continually shifting state of near-equilibrium by the opposing pressures of recurrent mutation, diffusion and weak selection. Only a few loci at any time can show fairly rapid changes in allelic frequencies from strong selection.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":8755,"question_id":8750,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1371028092},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dcceae48116382723d9f8a00221adbde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3842,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3842/arlin","reputation":26,"display_name":"arlin"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1372862202,"creation_date":1371733725,"body":"<p>I think there might be several places to read a description of these experiments, but they are discussed extensively in a book by historian-philosopher Lindley Darden, entitled \"Theory Change in Science: Strategies from Mendelian Genetics\", parts of which are <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_-jPuVdo08C\" rel=\"nofollow\">available online<\/a>.  See p. 112 of Darden's book for references to other accounts of these experiments by historians E.A. Carlson (1966) and W. Provine (1988). <\/p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows what Castle <strong>did<\/strong> but his aims have been obscured by \"Synthesis Historiography\" (i.e. making things turn out right for Ernst Mayr and his homies).  <\/p>\n\n<p>What Castle did was to breed rats in the laboratory and implement selection on coat patterns, with such success that he has able to get a large seemingly continuous range of forms. Imagine breeding oreos, with one line of selection of darker forms, and one of lighter, and achieving the success of getting both pure-black or pure-white oreos, and then lining up all the oreos from black to white to show the continuous range of forms.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The story that we hear from people like Wright and Provine is that this proved that selection can work on continuous variation, an idea that the \"mutationists\" allegedly rejected, paving the way for acceptance of Darwinism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Yet, while the experiments may have helped one version of Darwinism, they also represented the dying gasps of another form of Darwinism-- the form that Darwin proposed and Castle was (partially) defending. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can get an inkling of this from p. 143 of Provine's book, where you will find a curious confession, made in passing.  Provine is explaining why Pearson did not want to publish Fisher's famous 1918 paper.  He writes \"Pearson claimed, and Darwin would probably have agreed, that the continuous variations in a pure line were heritable and that continued selection in a pure line should be effective.\"   <\/p>\n\n<p>Why would Pearson believe-- 17 years <strong>after<\/strong> the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance-- that the environmental variations in Johannsen's pure lines were suitable material for selection?  The reason is that this is what Darwin believed, and Pearson was a follower of Darwin.  Darwin's \"indefinite variability\", the fuel for modification in his theory of \"natural selection\", described in Ch. 1 of the OOS, is clearly a description of environmental variation-- it is always present and emerges anew every generation in response to \"conditions of life\" (see Winther, 2000).  Darwin knew about \"definite\" single variations or \"sports\", which could be inherited perfectly (whereas indefinite variations were inherited by blending), but he didn't think they were important for evolution.  Darwin bet on the wrong horse, as Johannsen showed in 1903.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Pearson, Castle, and others defended Darwin's original view well into the 20th century.  They were not satisfied with the idea that selection merely sorted out stable Mendelian factors that undergo rare mutations.  Instead, they held out hope that there was some other form of heredity, or that the Mendelian units were squishy and underwent continuous shifts in potency under conditions of selection.  Thus Castle and Phillips in 1914 argued that \"the unit character for hooded pattern is itself variable\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Muller, Sturtevant and others from Morgan's lab disagreed, arguing instead that there were simply various Mendelian modifying factors in the background affecting coat color.  There was a long-running dispute over the proper genetic interpretation of Castle's results.  If you want a very clear statement of the dispute, go to a <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=2rhMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">1916 article by Jennings<\/a>, p. 287: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Castle finds that in rats he can, by selection, gradually increase\n  of decrease the amount of colour in the coat, passing by continuous\n  stages from one extreme to the other.  As to this, he holds two main\n  points: <\/p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The change is an actual change in the hereditary characteristics of the stock; not a mere result of the recombination of Mendelian\n  factors.  This is the general and fundamental point at issue.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>More specifically, he holds it to be an actual change in a single unit factor; this single factor changes its grade in a continuous and\n  quantitative manner.<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n  \n  <p>On the other side, the critics of these views\n  maintain that the changes shown are not actual alterations in the\n  hereditary constitution at all, but are mere results of recombinations\n  of Mendelian factors.  And specifically, they find a complete\n  explanation of such results as those of Castle in the hypothesis of\n  multiple modifying factors.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A few years later in 1919, Castle recanted his earlier view and accepted the multifactorial theory (the development of which is described by Kyung-Man Kim, cited below). <\/p>\n\n<p>And finally, the idea that the \"mutationists\" rejected selection on quantitative variation is mistaken.  What the mutationists rejected was selection on non-heritable environmental variations.  Johannsen's 1903 results were revolutionary because scientists at the time understood that they refuted Darwin's theory.  We don't \"get\" this today because \"Darwinism\" has been redefined to disentangle \"natural selection\" from Darwin's errant views of heredity-- see Jean Gayon's \"Darwinism's Struggle for Survival\" for more explanation. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Kim K-M. 1994.

If we have several copies of DNA (several cells), we can go a little bit further by sequencing same reads several times. If we assume an average cell is 30 um in diameter, we have ~40 000 cells in a cubic mm of tissue samle. this will allow us to extend the sequencing horizon by another 8000 years. With a cubic sample of intact, perfectly preserved tissue (this is REALLY A LOT and REALLY RARE) we could get an additional 5000 years, limiting our possibility to know the genome, let alone reproduce it to 26-30 000 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>By using a couple of sequence assembly tricks, such as existence of reference genomes of closely related species, we could either decrease the amount of tissue sames or allow the DNA to get a little bit more degraded. However, even with a cubic centimeter of tissue we won't be able to go beyond 50-100 000 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>The furthest we have gotten now is a <a href=\"http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neanderthal sequence<\/a> (~30 000 years) and it was already tough. It would be impossible to get a hand on dinasaurus DNA sequence, let alone trying to clone it. Mammoth, Saber-tooth Tiger and Dodo should be ok, provided we can find their remainders.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, Once you get the raw DNA sequence, you have to get the epigenetic code right, find a compatible egg of a related spicies (that is quite hard), inject your DNA into it, and hopefully, with lots of ifs you can get your clone and hope it survives. However the part about getting the epigenetic code right and finding a compatible egg is really not easy. Personally, I won't parry on anything that doesn't have close related species still living.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: as of June 2013 a genome of a wild horse 700 000 years old have been sequenced, which is the furthers we could get so far.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8608,"question_id":8590,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1372459118},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"score":0,"post_id":8609,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"edited":false,"creation_date":1372846764,"comment_id":11783,"body":"@GriffinEvo You shouldn\u2019t add content like this to other answers \u2013 instead, post your own answer."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":8609,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1372848482,"comment_id":11785,"body":"@KonradRudolph Apologies, here is my additional point but I am not going to write a whole answer because this isn&#39;t a complete answer: This TED talk (<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_archer_how_we_ll_resurrect_the_gastric_brooding_frog_the_tasmanian_tiger.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ted.com/talks/&hellip;<\/a>), from June 2013, is about such projects which are trying to rescue two recently extinct species and they seem to be making some progress."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1372848499,"creation_date":1370092303,"body":"<p>I'll just add that projects to clone a mammoth have been <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/1999/apr/cover\" rel=\"nofollow\">active for over a decade<\/a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/06/06/will-we-ever-clone-a-mammoth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">privately funded projects are also underway<\/a>.

This is not true for scientific theories, which, instead are confirmed by experimental data.<\/p>\n\n<p>The OED defines <strong>theory<\/strong> as:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and <strong>fact<\/strong> as:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Something that has really occurred or is actually the case; something certainly known to be of this character; hence, a particular truth known by actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred, or to a conjecture or fiction; a datum of experience, as distinguished from the conclusions that may be based upon it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, essentially we start with an unproven idea, we corroborate it with facts (=experimental data) and we define our theory accordingly to facts. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, why don't we say that evolution is true or that it is a dogma or that it is a fact?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, that is not how science work. Evolution is a scientific theory, and it always will be. Maybe (hopefully, dare I say) in 50 years from now new evidence will have make us change the theory of evolution, at least some bits of it.<br>\nLuckily evolutionary biology is not stuck at the time of Darwin and genetics is not stuck at the time of Mendel. Many new pieces of evidence have made us <strong>improve<\/strong> the theories that they initially defined. <\/p>\n\n<p>Does that mean they were bad scientist or that they experiments were faked? Not at all!  Simply as their knowledge was more restricted than ours, they could not formulate a more advanced theory. Mendel's experiments still hold true, but now we know that transmissions of characters is not as simple. He was just looking at <em>a special case<\/em>. And his experiments still fit in our current theory, and will have to fit in any future one.<\/p>\n\n<p>A scientific theory is defined by its falsifiability, that is <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the trait of a statement, hypothesis, or theory whereby it could be shown to be false if some conceivable observation were true. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with nullify, meaning not \"to commit fraud\" but \"show to be false\".<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The famous black swan example by Karl Popper (see e.g. <a href=\"http://books.google.no/books?id=IENmxiVBaSoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Conjectures%20and%20Refutations%3A%20The%20Growth%20of%20Scientific%20Knowledge&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Conjectures%20and%20Refutations%3a%20The%20Growth%20of%20Scientific%20Knowledge&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Karl Popper. 2002 .

From this one can conclude:<br>\n      At least one swan is white.<br>\n  From this, one may wish to conjecture:<br>\n      All swans are white.<br>\n  It is impractical to observe all the swans in the world to verify that they are all white.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Even so, the statement all swans are white is testable by being falsifiable. For, if in testing many swans, the researcher finds a single black swan, then the statement all swans are white would be falsified by the counterexample of the single black swan.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, our theory of the white swan is accepted as \"temporary true\", as long as a black swan is not found.

To understand this, you need to think about the actual conditions of the reaction: unless it's taking place inside a cell, which straight biochemical reactions of the kind you're talking about almost never are, then the enzyme, substrate, and product are all floating around at a certain concentration. The enzymatic reaction is proceeding nicely, and as the substrate binding pocket is freed as product dissociates from the enzyme and diffuses away, allowing another substrate molecule to take its place and the next reaction to occur. This is the situation at your 2 mmol [substrate] level. At 50 mmol, the concentration of substrate is much higher, and so even though the actual catalytic portion of the enzymatic reaction is taking place at essentially the same speed, the rate of substrate diffusing into the active pocket is somewhat higher because the local concentration of substrate is higher, allowing for an apparently slightly faster reaction rate.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9029,"question_id":9024,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1372551254}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9024/why-are-enzyme-catalysed-reactions-slower-at-lower-substrate-concentration","last_activity_date":1372618617,"creation_date":1372537569,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why are enzyme-catalysed reactions slower at lower substrate concentration?","body":"<p>Suppose I'm using 200 nmoles of enzyme and 2 mmoles of substrate.

The explanation that follows may not be exact, but I hope that it helps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, think about a simple electrophoresis set-up - in agarose electrophoresis of DNA we have a uniformly distributed buffer such as Tris-borate. The current is carried by the borate ions and the DNA molecules run through the <strong>homogeneous<\/strong> electric field towards the anode. They separate by size because of the sieving effect of the agarose matrix.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's think about what is happening in an SDS-PAGE separation (a Laemmli gel). Just to remind you:<\/p>\n\n<p>The running (or reservoir)  buffer is Tris-glycine pH 8.3<br>\nThe stacking gel is in Tris.HCl pH 6.8<br>\nThe separating gel is in Tris.HCl pH 8.8<\/p>\n\n<p>When the power supply is turned on, the glycinate ion in the top reservoir begins to move into the stacking gel. When it hits the zone of pH = 6.8 it is much closer to its pK<sub>a<\/sub> and so is now only weakly charged. Consequently it slows down. Meanwhile the chloride ions in the stacking gel have begun to move rapidly down through the stacking gel (towards the anode). This creates a <strong>discontinuous<\/strong> electric field: the chloride zone has a lower resistance than the glycinate zone so the field strength in the chloride zone is weaker than the field strength in the glycinate zone. This is a stable situation because the ions cannot stray into each other's zones: if a glycinate ion happens to diffuse forwards into the chloride zone it will experience a weaker field and slow down, whereas if a chloride ion diffuses back into the glycinate zone it will hit the stronger field and quickly move ahead again.<\/p>\n\n<p>What about the SDS-protein complexes that were in the well? (I'll just refer to these as proteins from now on.) Their ionic properties lie between the glycinate and the chloride, and so they eventually end up moving through the stacking gel between the trailing zone of glycinate and the leading zone of chloride. Any protein that finds itself in the glycinate zone will move quickly forward (due to the higher field strength) and any protein that moves ahead by chance into the chloride zone will slow down due to the weak field strength, falling back into the protein zone. And in this way these zones move in a procession through the stacking gel, with the proteins being focussed into a very narrow region in the middle. The glycinate, the proteins and the chloride are all moving at the same speed, and so this is an example of isotachophoresis (isotacho- = \"same speed\"). The polyacrylamide gel matrix in the stacking gel has no separating function - its role is simply to stabilise against convective effects. The proteins can reach very high local concentrations in the stacking gel, and if you look carefully you will often see refractive effects as your sample runs through the stacking gel. In this way the protein sample is \"applied\" to the separating gel in a very tight band, perfect for achieving high resolution separation (bands broaden by diffusion in the separating gel so the tighter the bands ar eat the point of loading, the better the final result.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Once the sample hits the separating gel, all of this breaks down: the pH is now 8.8 so the glycinate becomes strongly charged and zooms off ahead with the chloride through the gel, leaving the proteins to move more slowly due to the sieving effect of the polyacrylamide matrix.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is possible to set up an isotachophoresis as described above in isolation. Individual proteins will have slightly different ionic properties and will line up in the region between the two buffer ions, allowing for their separation. <\/p>\n","answer_id":9028,"question_id":9007,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9007/what-is-the-exact-principle-of-capillary-isotachophoresis","last_activity_date":1372541795,"creation_date":1372413789,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the exact principle of capillary isotachophoresis?","body":"<p>I know it's a type of capillary electrophoresis, but I don't get how does the separation happen exactly. <\/p>\n","question_id":9007,"tags":["molecular-biology","biophysics"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":9028,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1574,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/166093d036b7185b3a53052889d99e47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1472,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1472/mew","reputation":836,"display_name":"Mew","accept_rate":86},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/166093d036b7185b3a53052889d99e47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1472,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1472/mew","reputation":836,"display_name":"Mew","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":5597,"edited":false,"creation_date":1356595356,"comment_id":8063,"body":"Also note there is a condition known as Situs Inversus with Dextrocardia, which is where the placement of all the organs in a person with this condition is a mirror of that of a normal person."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/166093d036b7185b3a53052889d99e47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1472,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1472/mew","reputation":836,"display_name":"Mew","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":5597,"edited":false,"creation_date":1356595555,"comment_id":8064,"body":"So I am asking that since people can live normal lives with Situs Inversus Dextrocardia, why is the placement of the heart on the left so much more common than placement of the heart on the right?

I'm going to refer to defective haemoglobin found in a sickle cell patient as HbS and normal haemoglobin as HbA. Under certain circumstances (low O<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations) the HbS protein is prone to aggregating into long filaments.

This causes the anaemia (specifically a haemolytic anaemia, due to erythrocyte destruction, and nothing to do with a lack of iron).<\/p>\n\n<p>The appearance of the ability to form filaments is due to a single Glu>Val mutation in the two &beta; subunits of the haemoglobin tetramer. The new amino acid can fit into a pre-existing hydrophobic pocket on the surface of another subunit and so the molecules can daisy-chain to form the filaments. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The normal HbA can also bind on to a growing filament (it has the binding pocket) but that terminates the filament (because HbA doesn't have the Val residue).<\/strong> In this way people with sickle cell trait are protected from the anaemia by their normal haemoglobin.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8986,"question_id":8985,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1372353325}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8985/why-dont-individuals-with-sickle-cell-trait-suffer-from-sickle-cell-anemia","last_activity_date":1372360333,"creation_date":1372342384,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why don't individuals with sickle cell trait suffer from sickle cell anemia?","body":"<p>Ostensibly, in people with sickle cell trait, half of the hemoglobin in their body would be defective. <\/p>\n\n<p>Is it actually the case that sickle cell hemoglobin is produced in equal amounts?\nIf not, how is that regulated?

Silicon compounds are\n  generally stable but do not support the ability readily to re-combine\n  in different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support\n  lifelike processes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a great documentary from a physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_%28physicist%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brian Cox<\/a> published by BBC this year called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_Life_%28TV_series%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wonders Of Life<\/a> which deals with the basic questions how carbon based creatures were \"born\" on this planet ;) + other interesting things about life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Brian talks there why the first organisms were created probably in water and how it could be.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why water?<\/strong> \n<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/liquid-of-life.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/liquid-of-life.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And why is water the best liquid to do the job?

Since, as you say, DNA replication is semi-conservative, the two daughter cells of a bacterial cell division each inherit one old DNA strand and one new DNA strand and so have the same probability of sustaining a given mutation. The overall mutational frequency has to be an aggregate of what has happened in both of them (and in all other cells in the population) since there is no way of distinguishing between them. In terms of your question the answer is (2) and this is why the mutation rate is normalised per genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>In practice this figure is arrived at as follows. Suppose that you study a 1 kb gene, gene X, and measure the rate of spontaneous mutation in that gene (by some convenient assay) as 1 mutation per 10<sup>7<\/sup> cell divisions (again see the Drake reference for details). Assume also that the bacteria have a genome size of 2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> bp.  Since each cell division equates to the creation of one new genome we get:<\/p>\n\n<p>mutations per gene X per generation = 1 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>mutations per bp per generation  = 1 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup>/1000 (because it is a 1000 bp gene)<\/p>\n\n<p>mutations per genome per generation = 1 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup> * 2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup>/1000<\/p>\n\n<p>mutations per genome per generation = 0.0002<\/p>\n\n<p>Now this is an underestimate because not all mutations will create a detectable change in phenotype. Drake uses a correction factor of 3.12 for this.<\/p>\n\n<p>true mutations per genome per generation = 0.0002 * 3.12 = 0.0006 or 6 x 10<sup>-4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>These were made-up numbers.

CASP is basically a contest, held every 2 years where anyone can use their algorithm to predict the 3D structure of a protein whose structure is known, but not publicly available.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its been a few years since I reviewed them results much - it looks like this year was interesting, but a perennial winner has been <a href=\"http://rosettadesigngroup.com/blog/865/a-plos-one-rosetta-collection/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosetta<\/a>, which has turned into an edifice of many suites of software which each execute different tasks in protein folding and modeling.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Open source software is pretty hard to find in this field.  The software is complex.  It usually includes components of machine and statistical learning, molecular dynamics, specialized algorithms that build up the protein one residue at a time, others which manipulate blocks of the protein structure around in space, electrostatic calculations, you name it.  In addition, the software, once it gives some sort of result is quite valuable.  I don't think any of these suites has really been released.  I know that <a href=\"https://www.rosettacommons.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosetta<\/a> is available to use as a web service, but you have to apply for access to the source.  I don't think its an easy thing to get. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the most complicated components are available open source.  Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling\" rel=\"nofollow\">open source software<\/a> is quite sophisticated.

I am also not interested in the trivial answer: that the voltage-gated channels are configured to require a transition across the -40mV or so threshold in order to fire an action potential.

We want to avoid getting too close to either end, since the channels become less effective near their reversal potentials, so maybe the effective range is more like -70 to +30 (to go outside that range, we must sacrifice speed). Within that 100mV range, we leave the bottom 30mV or so for EPSP integration, and the other 60mV for action potentials.  Now, if the resting potential was 0mV, the available dynamic range for integration and spiking would be much smaller which probably translates to making the output noisier. <\/p>\n","question_id":8811,"tags":["neuroscience","electrophysiology"],"score":6,"accepted_answer_id":8859,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2933,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3795"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxfyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3059/dd3","reputation":2303,"display_name":"dd3","accept_rate":95},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1371671567,"creation_date":1371671567,"body":"<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=RJEg-p-9iqsC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">At least 25%<\/a> of the original liver seems to be the minimum for regrowth.<\/p>\n\n<p>The initial regrowth is due to proliferation of hepatocytes: they exit G0 and enter mitosis.

The difference between proto-oncogene and TSG is mainly in their heritability - TSG mutations are usually recessive (because a heterozygote will still express sufficient suppressor, e.g. p53) whereas proto-oncogenes are dominant (if a consitutively active agent e.g. Ras is present, it doesn't matter if the other allele is under normal control).<\/p>\n\n<p>A single \"hit\" in this way (TSG or proto-oncogene) may just cause the cell to die, which isn't a bad thing (in fact, TSG such as p53 often work by inducing apoptosis because proliferative errors make them accumulute). A tumour only results when a single cell accumulates sufficient mutations and genomic damage to gain a reproductive advantage over the cells in its vicinity.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, you are asking about <em>cancer<\/em>, which is not simply a tumour. Tumours are any sort of abnormal growth, i.e. neoplasms, but they can be benign! This means they stay in their tumour capsule, do not grow at a fast rate and do not invade or metastasise other tissues. The distinct characteristics that define a cancer are very well-known and were published in a well recognised paper by Weinberg &amp; Hanahan, 2002, \"The Hallmarks of Cancer\".<\/p>\n\n<p>The six primary hallmarks of cancer. The first two are the ones most people know, but the other ones are just as essential for <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Independence from external growth signals<\/strong>: Cancer cells produce their on autocrine growth factors or have mutated signal pathways active without GF receptor stimulation (<strong>Oncogenes<\/strong>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resistance to anti-growth signals<\/strong>: Cancer cells do not respond to growth-inhibitory factors from outside or inside (<strong>Tumour suppressor genes<\/strong>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Evasion of apoptosis<\/strong>: Cancer cells resist signals which cause normal cells to die (apoptose) (these are also tumour suppressor genes).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limitless replication / Evasion of cell senescence<\/strong>: Apart from stem cells, all normal cells can only replicate their genome a certain number of times before the ends of the chromosomes known as telomeres are too short, disintegrate and cause the cell to enter senescence or die. Cancer cells express telomerase, which extends telomeres and maintains replicative potential.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sustained angiogenesis<\/strong>: Tumours and cancers form massive cell heaps. Tumours may stall growth because blood vessels do not grow into the heap and supply the cells with the nutrients needed to proliferate. Cancer cells have found a way to induce blood vessel growth (VEGF) and sustain it in order to maintain nutrient supply.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invasion and metastasis<\/strong>: This is the crucial, most distinguishing difference between benign neoplasm (tumour) and malign neoplasm (cancer). Cancer cells degrade the extracellular matrix around them (by secreting metallo-matrix-proteases, MMP), which allows them to move away from where they are and invade into neighbouring tissues. They can also spill into blood vessels this way (especially if the neoplasm is well-vascularised thanks to hallmark number 5), where they can travel to other sites in the body and grow new cancerous tumours in other locations.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>There are four more emerging hallmarks and enabling characteristics (immune evasion, inflammation induction, modification of energy metabolism, genomic instability), which allow better cancer growth and make a cancer more dangerous if it acquires them, but these are outside the scope of this answer.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2717,"question_id":2716,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1371576110},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27981de8bdf871ff9ea9632c813c0b6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1049,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1049/user4673","reputation":238,"display_name":"user4673"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1340319132,"creation_date":1340319132,"body":"<p>There is a nice <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7239/full/nature07943.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">nature paper<\/a> by Dr. Micheal Stratton et al. that I think might be a good place to start.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think answering you question is complex, because different cancers will actually have different mechanisms that trigger their onset and aggressiveness and as such some have more complex mutational landscapes than others.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good question to ask yourself is : what is a driver mutation and what is a passenger mutation.

According to Cooper &amp; Herrin, ever since aerobic respiration gave rise to multicellular organisms which in turn needed protection from invasion by single-cell organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>They state that around 500 million years ago, the first adaptive immune systems evolved in vertebrates, but do not explain <em>how<\/em> although they attempt to. Instead, they explain why we are not able to discern at the moment how this evolution came about. The main reason given is that it is unknown when some key cells evolved (namely natural killer cells and dendritic cells) Additionally, mice and humans evolved two different kinds of natural killer cell receptors relatively recently while sharing a common ancestor only quite a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently jawed and jawless vertebrates have also evolved two different kinds of adaptive immune systems. They both seem to rely on the same mechanisms but on a different molecular and genetic basis. Cooper &amp; Herrin conclude that at the current level of research, we are not able to determine the evolution of our immune system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v10/n1/full/nri2686.html#B2\" rel=\"nofollow\">How did our complex immune system evolve?<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, if I'm allowed to give in to the temptation of speculation a bit, I would go by a similar strategy as the evolution of Krebs cycle - look which bits make sense even without the rest. There is of course the major obstacle that the cells of the immune system require an entirely new branch in haemopoiesis: all innate immune cells (aside from natural killer, NK cells) derive from the common myeloid progenitor, whereas all adaptive immune cells (and NK cells) derive from the common <em>lymphoid<\/em> progenitor.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think this may even be a first hint: NK cells are innate immune cells but they derive from a different lineage at the highest level - they may have evolved as the first lymphoid cells after the myeloid innate immune cells. The next closest related cell is the cytotoxic T cell (CD8+, aka Tc), which utilises the exact same killing mechanisms (perforin+granzymes and Fas ligand) and attaches to other cells in almost the same way as the NK cell (immune synapse). It is also independent and can kill on its own, as long as it recognises its specific antigen. This is the main difference and also a very large step - the generation of the specific T cell receptor. Once the specific T cells receptor is developed, the step to helper T cells (CD4+, Th) is not far, although these perform a relatively bystander-like role in the immune response, steering the other immune cells from behind the scenes and not directly effecting any killing of the pathogen. Therefore I would guess that before helper T cells, B cells evolved, which are capable of producing antibodies. Antibodies themselves are very similar to the T cell receptor (not in gross structure but in the underlying genetic domains and their processing), so a 'detachable' antigen-specific T cell receptor may have evolved and ultimately caused the development of a new cell type. Once all these components are present, it is necessary (or beneficial) to control which cell types are the most active and in which way they act at the site of infection. This is exactly what helper T cells do, by steering the local immune response either into a Th1 (cytotoxic) or a Th2 ('humoral', anti-parasitic) response direction.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2094,"question_id":2065,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1371497455}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2065/in-which-order-did-the-cells-of-the-immune-system-evolve","last_activity_date":1371497455,"creation_date":1335992602,"answer_count":1,"title":"In which order did the cells of the immune system evolve?","body":"<p>Thinking about how complex the interactions between different types of immune system cells (T-helpers, T-Killers, Phagocytes, B-Cells etc.) are, it's fascinating how they all combine to get the desired effect.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I assume that they didn't all evolve simultaneously!

As a random example, Arabian Oryx was nearly hunted to extinction specifically because of their horns.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Please note that this is NOT a simple question - for example, the often-cited in unscientific literature example of Irish Elk that supposedly went extinct due to its antler size may not be a good crystal-clear example. For a very thorough analysis, see: <em>\"<strong>Sexy to die for? Sexual selection and risk of extinction<\/strong>\" by Hanna Kokko and Robert Brooks, Ann. Zool. Fennici 40: 207-219<\/em>. [<strong>STUDY #1<\/strong>]<\/p>\n\n<p>They specifically find that evolutionary \"suicide\" is unlikely in deterministic environments, at least if the costs of the feature are borne by the individual organism itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another study resulting in a negative result was <em>\"<strong>Sexual selection and the risk of extinction in mammals<\/strong>\", Edward H. Morrow and Claudia Fricke; The Royal Society Proceedings: Biological Sciences, Published online 4 November 2004, pp 2395-2401<\/em> [<strong>STUDY #2<\/strong>]<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The aim of this study was therefore to examine whether the level of\n  sexual selection (measured as residual testes mass and sexual size dimorphism) was related to the risk of extinction that mammals are currently experiencing. We found no evidence for a relationship between these factors, although our analyses may have been confounded by the possible dominating effect of contemporary anthropogenic factors.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, if one takes into consideration changes in the environment, the extinction becomes theoretically possible. From <em>\"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410506\"><strong>Runaway Evolution to Self-Extinction Under Asymmetrical Competition<\/strong><\/a>\" - Hiroyuki Matsuda and Peter A. Abrams; Evolution Vol. 48, No. 6 (Dec., 1994), pp. 1764-1772<\/em>: [<strong>STUDY #3<\/strong>]<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We show that purely intraspecific competition can cause evolution of extreme competitive abilities that ultimately result in extinction, without any influence from other species. The only change in the model required for this outcome is the assumption of a nonnormal distribution of resources of different sizes measured on a logarithmic scale. This suggests that taxon cycles, if they exist, may be driven by within- rather than between-species competition. Self-extinction does not occur when the advantage conferred by a large value of the competitive trait (e.g., size) is relatively small, or when the carrying capacity decreases at a comparatively rapid rate with increases in trait value. The evidence regarding these assumptions is discussed. The results suggest a need for more data on resource distributions and size-advantage in order to understand the evolution of competitive traits such as body size. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As far as supporting evidence, some studies are listed in <em>\"<strong>Can adaptation lead to extinction?<\/strong>\" by Daniel J. Rankin and Andre´s Lo´pez-Sepulcre, OICOS 111:3 (2005)<\/em>. [<strong>STUDY #4<\/strong>]<\/p>\n\n<p>They cite 3:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first example is a <strong>study on the Japanese medaka\n  fish Oryzias latipes (Muir and Howard 1999 - [STUDY #5])<\/strong>. Transgenic males which had been modified to include a salmon growth-hormone gene are larger than their wild-type counterparts, although their offspring have a lower fecundity (Muir and Howard 1999). Females\n  prefer to mate with larger males, giving the larger\n  transgenic males a fitness advantage over wild-type\n  males. However, offspring produced with transgenic\n  males have a lower fecundity, and hence average female\n  fecundity will decrease. As long as females preferentially\n  mate with larger males, the population density will\n  decline. Models of this system have predicted that, if\n  the transgenic fish were released into a wild-type\n  population, the transgene would spread due to its mating\n  advantage over wild-type males, and the population\n  would become go extinct (Muir and Howard 1999).\n  A recent extension of the model has shown that\n  alternative mating tactics by wild-type males could\n  reduce the rate of transgene spread, but that this is still\n  not sufficient to prevent population extinction (Howard\n  et al. 2004). <strong>Although evolutionary suicide was predicted\n  from extrapolation, rather than observed in nature, this\n  constitutes the first study making such a prediction from\n  empirical data<\/strong>.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In cod, Gadus morhua, the commercial fishing of large\n  individuals has resulted in selection towards earlier\n  maturation and smaller body sizes (<strong>Conover and Munch\n  2002 [STUDY #6]<\/strong>). Under exploitation, high mortality decreases the\n  benefits of delayed maturation. As a result of this,\n  smaller adults, which mature faster, have a higher fitness\n  relative to their larger, slow maturing counterparts\n  (Olsen et al. 2004). Despite being more successful\n  relative to slow maturing individuals, the fast-maturing\n  adults produce fewer offspring, on average. This adaptation,\n  driven by the selective pressure imposed by\n  harvesting, seems to have pre-empted a fishery collapse\n  off the Atlantic coast of Canada (Olsen et al. 2004). <strong>As\n  the cod evolved to be fast-maturing, population size was\n  gradually reduced until it became inviable and vulnerable\n  to stochastic processes.<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The only strictly experimental evidence for evolutionary\n  suicide comes from microbiology. In the social\n  bacterium Myxococcus xanthus<\/strong> individuals can develop\n  cooperatively into complex fruiting structures (Fiegna\n  and Velicer 2003 - [<strong>STUDY #7<\/strong>]). Individuals in the fruiting body are\n  then released as spores to form new colonies. Artificially\n  selected cheater strains produce a higher number of\n  spores than wild types. These cheaters were found to\n  invade wild-type strains, eventually causing extinction of\n  the entire population (Fiegna and Velicer 2003). The\n  cheaters invade the wild-type population because they\n  have a higher relative fitness, but as they spread through\n  the population, they decrease the overall density, thus\n  driving themselves and the population in which they\n  reside, to extinction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another experimental study was <em>\"<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/100/10/5858.full.pdf\"><strong>Sexual selection affects local extinction and turnover\nin bird communities<\/strong><\/a>\" - Paul F.

These findings have led to the prediction that\n  local extinction rates should be higher for speciespopulations\n  with intense sexual selection. We tested this prediction by analyzing\n  the dynamics of natural bird communities at a continental\n  scale over a period of 21 years (1975\u20131996), using relevant statistical\n  tools. In agreement with the theoretical prediction, <strong>we found\n  that sexual selection increased risks of local extinction (dichromatic\n  birds had on average a 23% higher local extinction rate than\n  monochromatic species)<\/strong>. However, despite higher local extinction\n  probabilities, <strong>the number of dichromatic species did not decrease\n  over the period considered in this study. This pattern was caused\n  by higher local turnover rates of dichromatic species<\/strong>, resulting in\n  relatively stable communities for both groups of species. Our\n  results suggest that these communities function as metacommunities,\n  with frequent local extinctions followed by colonization.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This result is similar to another bird-centered study: <em><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3545671\"><strong>Sexual Selection and the Risk of Extinction of Introduced Birds on Oceanic Islands<\/strong><\/a>\": Denson K.
