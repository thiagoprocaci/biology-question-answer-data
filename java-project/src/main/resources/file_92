This gives some idea of how TAG genes respond to one another, but of course will not find the promoter sequences or the transcription factors themselves. <\/p>\n\n<p>Having spent a summer going over fatty acid synthesis, I can only say that there has been a lot of wet lab work done on these pathways which would probably be conserved in the Jatropha plant.  The literature would be quite extensive.  Integrating all of that is more like a paper for publication than an answer on stackexchange.  This sort of outlines the procedure... do you have a more focused question? <\/p>\n\n<p>I'll outline one way of approaching this - there are an uncountable number of variants if you tweak it.  There are other ways to get this, most notably looking for defective mutants, the method which is still used in plants quite a bit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway here is a genome based approach:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Identify genes in the pathway of interest.<\/strong> choose 10 or so genes that you think constitute your network.  This is an editorial decision. Ultimately if you start looking at genes regulated by the same transcription factors as being included in your network, you will eventually take in the entire genome and the work will be impossible to accomplish. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>find candidate promotor binding sites<\/strong>. look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_%28genetics%29#Eukaryotic_promoters\" rel=\"nofollow\">upstream promotor regions<\/a> for all these genes.  you can look at how these are conserved between similar plants by examining the same gene promotor regions aligned against each other.  This doesn't work very well.  <\/p>\n\n<p>2b) Another way of finding these is to do a <strong>pull down experiment<\/strong> where transcription factors are bound to DNA and a DNAse digestion is done and remaining fragments identify the binding sites.  All this somewhat assumes that you kind of know which transcription factors are responsible for each gene. That is probably not the case here. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) find the transcription factors important for the plant pathway.  this is not easy - one way is to try knock outs of the TF genes.  I imagine this plant has 4000 + of these genes.  around 1-2% may be involved.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So far these methods have been use for the ENCODE project as well as some bacterial genomes.  a plant is a new scenario which will have issues of its own. <\/p>\n","answer_id":15566,"question_id":15563,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1394414001}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15563/systems-biology-of-triacylglycerol-tag-synthesis-in-jatropha","last_activity_date":1394414001,"creation_date":1394185285,"answer_count":1,"title":"Systems Biology of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in Jatropha","body":"<p>I need the genetic regulatory network of TAG synthesis (Kennedy pathway) of Jatropha plant??\nOr is there any way to convert metabolic pathway into genetic regulatory network?<\/p>\n","question_id":15563,"tags":["bioinformatics","genomics","biotechnology","systems-biology"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":100,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1394196657},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0c9f3d3dbc51e38cbe92fe386135ad9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3037,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3037/mart","reputation":324,"display_name":"mart","accept_rate":55},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1394399036,"creation_date":1394399036,"body":"<p>First of all, the wikipedia article you quote states that methionine is synthesized from cysteine in <em>plants and microorganisms<\/em>, not in humans.

If you have access to a -80C or liquid nitrogen storage its possible, but also less likely. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7051/abs/436641a.html\">Cloning an animal typically starts with the transplantation of a nucleus into an egg cell whose nucleus has been removed<\/a>.  So unless things change drastically in the next 20 years, just purifying DNA and keeping it in a tube of the fridge is not enough - you need to preserve epithelial (skin cells) or some other tissue in a state which can be revived to produce a live and intact cell when you want to do the cloning.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its possible that we will have machines that can take DNA from a DNA prep and produce a living cell - this is what we hope to do with the mammoth and other extinct animals from fossil tissue some day.  But whether that will be the case in 20 years is just a guess, whether it is affordable is also just a guess. <\/p>\n\n<p>So from what we know now, you will need to preserve a piece of tissue from the animal when it is alive.  I'm not an expert on how to do this, but you might be able to get the skin cells to sort of turn into a cell line and then freeze them for not too much money.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you do this, regular freezers are not cold enough to prevent freezer burn.  This is what happens when you put a steak in to the freezer, wrapped in plastic even it will shrivel up and start to dry out as the water in the ice starts to sublime out of the package (the dry air in the freezer basically sucks the water out of the food).  If this happens to your animal tissue, its probably not going to revive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scientific labs use -80C freezers and liquid nitrogen storage because the water turns into a glass and all biochemical reactions are basically stopped. (besides drying out, the enzymes like DNAse are still nominally functioning in the cells at -20C and even simple bacterial cells don't live for more than a year at -20C, much less mammalian cells).  For preserving cell lines, liquid nitrogen is much more preferred.  I would say that properly produced cell lines can theoretically revive after indefinite liquid nitrogen storage.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So that's a quick answer.  Sorry to be a party pooper - things could change quite a bit in the next 20 years, but we just don't know how much.  popping a paw in a baggie or some DNA extract into the freezer might work, but its hard to say for sure. <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the choice of where the DNA comes from in the animal, its true that skin cell lines are often producing imperfect animals - the DNA may be modified in the skin in various ways that cause the animal to be smaller, weaker, or even deformed compared to the donor.  At this time all the protocols I see (and i could be wrong) are skin cells.  I would expect that there is a better tissue to preserve, but that might be just a guess at this point.  Its likely that in the next 20 years the choice of cell line from the donor will change quite a bit as well.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":2257,"question_id":2231,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2231/how-to-diy-preserve-pet-dna-today-so-that-it-can-be-used-in-20-years","last_activity_date":1394357379,"creation_date":1336695165,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to DIY preserve pet DNA today so that it can be used in 20 years","body":"<p>I know that there are companies that offer a kit+storage of your pet DNA for around $2k.\nMy question is if there is any other option for doing this yourself with a thought in mind that in 20+ years the technology will get so advanced that even this DIY sample can be utilized.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

The closest I have now to bland, flavorless, zero thought/effort food is Wheaties.<\/p>\n\n<p>longer answer:\nSeriously though, dogfood for humans wouldn't be that hard to make. If you just took everything from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake\">RDI<\/a> guidelines (the Recommended Daily Intake from which they calculate the percentages you find on food labels) and mashed it all together into a thick brown paste you would get all of the macro and micro nutrients that you theoretically require. Precise proportions are irrelevant because:<\/p>\n\n<p>a) everyone is a little different, and<\/p>\n\n<p>b) to some extent, our bodies are able to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21222652\">fine tune<\/a> our digestive tracts to fit our specific diets (presumably this tuning would occur even faster if you ate the exact same thing for every meal). You're a mammalian omnivore. Enjoy it!<\/p>\n\n<p>You probably shouldn't try to live on something like this for the rest of your life, since there's plenty of research suggesting that there are other micronutrients, such as phytocompounds (i.e. plant stuffs), that are poorly understood but may be beneficial to humans. One thing to note here is that any health claims about any antioxidant that is not on the list of essential vitamins (vitamin C is an antioxidant on the list) are almost certainly bunk and/or hokum.<\/p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that you would only need, at most, utterly minuscule quantities of these miscellaneous micronutrients. You would be fine(ish) for at least a few months. For related reasons, your statement:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The composition is also known for human babies. This is manufactured as \"baby formula\". Everything baby's organism needs to be healthy (and to grow).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>is largely correct but somewhat flawed. While it is true that many babies are raised solely on formula and subsequently turn out just fine, there are some things that you can only get from mother's milk. For example, the mother passes on components of her own immune system to her baby through her milk, which then help to strengthen the baby's own immune system. These are the kind of subtle but useful compounds which are encountered in a \"natural\" diet but which could never realistically be included in people chow.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1939,"question_id":1910,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1335211735},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d86534cf5207d423f528e238e4815f3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1585,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1585/jo-rijo","reputation":259,"display_name":"Jo Rijo"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1353870468,"creation_date":1352741079,"body":"<p>there are of course foods for bodybuilders and for weightgainers and losers, never seen just one food containing all (and I activly searched for it) but you can create your own mix if you buy some protein suplements (that are usaly made from whey and other byproducts that have a good ratio of the various essencial aminoacids) or just soyabeans that also have good aminoacid ratios and is cheaper; some carb rich foods and those complete vitamin/mineral suplements + essencial fattyacids (ie: cods liver oil). only problem is finding a trully complete vitamin/mineral supplement.

Additionally, the recovered organisms required special care to achieve growth:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most of the bacteria isolated required either increased CO2 or\n  anaerobic conditions for growth, along with prolonged incubation, and\n  they often were present in numbers below the threshold of detection\n  used in routine diagnostic urine culture protocols.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, fresh urine is non-sterile but probably unlikely to cause infection in healthy persons.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the process of leaving the body, there is a chance of contamination from organisms living in the urinary tract or on the surface of the body.

An ORF is a stretch of DNA from which a single protein may be produced.  However, an ORF is not strictly required for a gene (as not all genes encode proteins), and not all ORFs are genes. There are many software tools for gene prediction available which use different rules to predict if a given region of DNA is functional (contains a gene or a regulatory element). They may be usable on any kind of DNA sequence, or on sequences from certain organisms only, depending on the program.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two commmonly used gene prediction tool are GLIMMER (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/glimmer_3.cgi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/glimmer_3.cgi<\/a>, used for microbial genomes) and GeneMark (<a href=\"http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/gmhmm2_prok.cgi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/gmhmm2_prok.cgi<\/a>).

Perceived and marketed as a \"healthier alternative\" to conventional cigarettes, few data exist regarding the safety of these devices and their efficacy in harm reduction and treatment of tobacco dependence; even less is known about their overall impact on population health. This review highlights the recent data regarding electronic cigarette toxicity, impact on lung function, and efficacy in smoking reduction and cessation. Studies show that the vapor generated from electronic cigarettes has variable amounts of nicotine and potential harmful toxins, albeit at levels lower than in conventional cigarettes. The long-term carcinogenic and lung function effects of electronic cigarettes are not known. Although some data demonstrate that electronic cigarettes may be effective in reducing conventional cigarette consumption, there are no data demonstrating the efficacy of electronic cigarettes as a tool to achieve cessation. Until robust longitudinal evaluations demonstrate the safety of electronic cigarettes and efficacy in treatment of tobacco dependence, their role as a harm reduction tool is unclear.\"<\/p>\n","answer_id":15527,"question_id":15519,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1394092666},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f47c5bf8326ea60124bb9d8e2facd99c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3394,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3394/biozic","reputation":508,"display_name":"biozic"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1394103150,"creation_date":1394103150,"body":"<p>Since the question is about risk specific to e-cigarette as opposed to classic cigarettes, what's left is the potential harm from the chemicals in refill-fluids (apart from nicotine): polyethylene glycol, glycerol, alcohol, linalol, flavours.

First, since the size of genomes varies greatly among organisms (from <a href=\"http://www.genomesize.com/prokaryotes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.5 Mb to 15 Mb<\/a> just for prokaryotes), there should be a fifth character in your set, representing the absence of a nucleotide.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also issues of whether various combinations are equivalent. For instance, bacterial genomes are often circular, so if we could convert one genome into another simply by rotating it, we would consider those genomes identical. For example, if the genomes each had 99 As and 1 T, it would not be meaningful to say that they are different just because of the location of the T. I think this would require use of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">multinomial coefficient<\/a> to count the number of identical variants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding your main thesis, your use of the term \"species\" has no relation to how that term is used among biologists. Biological species include genetic variation, so each of them would include many of your species. Also, one criteria for identifying species is the clustering of these sequences (and the absence of other, intermediate sequences).

Using a simplified example I will show you that gene*environment interactions affecting phenotype can allow separate species to occur despite being genetically identical. <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a very short section of DNA which affects seminal fluid proteins in a fruit fly. It is  just 10 bases long. The first three triplets of bases code for a protein constructed of three amino acids which affects the females behavior upon receipt of the male ejaculate. The final base regulates the expression of the first codon and is sensitive to developmental environmental factors (let us say nutrient richness). When the development of the male fly is in a nutrient rich background the section of DNA produces all three codons in equal amount to construct a protein and that protein stimulates the female to release eggs for fertilization. If we take a genetically identical male reared in a nutrient poor environment then the regulatory base increases the production of the first codon's amino acid. This makes a different protein structure which no longer stimulates the female in to releasing eggs, therefore the males from nutrient poor backgrounds can not reproduce with the females from a nutrient rich background, and these two genetically identical populations are different species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus I would say, <strong>no, the theoretical maximum number of species is not capped by the length of the DNA.<\/strong> However, given that just the potential number of bases (current highest estimates recorded are 150,000,000,000) far far far exceeds the number of species in the world, we can say that the number of base combinations is not the limiting factor on the biodiversity we see. That is down to evolution (selective and neutral processes). <strong>Phenotypes determine the ability of two individuals to reproduce, phenotypes are the result of more than just genetics:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>$phenotype = genotype + environment + genotype*environment$<\/p>\n\n<p>Further, as <strong>@mgkrebbs has already stated<\/strong>, the number of possible species (given by $4^x$ when $x$ is 150,000,000,000)  is, not only far more than the number of species that do exist, but also far more than the number of atoms in the universe. Assuming each species requires at least one atom then the number of atoms available will halt increasing numbers of species before the number of possible base combinations does.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13681,"question_id":13665,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1385558681},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002639029489/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":5859,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5859/louie-mcconnell","reputation":176,"display_name":"louie mcconnell"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZR6SM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5005,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5005/hello-there-andy","reputation":1616,"display_name":"hello_there_andy","accept_rate":69},"score":1,"post_id":15521,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394069411,"comment_id":20840,"body":"Nice that you spotted the similarity with books.

The term K antigen is\n  used for those that mask somatic (O) antigens.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In general, capsule polysaccharides have complex structures and are produced by a the action of several enzymes, with the genes necessary for production of the capsule typically making up a gene cluster in the genome (see for example Chen et al.: <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/274\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/274<\/a>). On the face of it, it would seem somewhat unlikely that a bacterium would produce a known capsular polysaccharide antigen without retaining the ability to produce a capsule, as the selective advantage of the capsule then would be lost. <\/p>\n\n<p>In actuality, the answer might depend on how you define \"have capsular antigen\" and \"capsule\". Historically, several methods have been used for demonstrating encapsulation. Methods based on staining microscopy or colony morphology observations tend to identify fewer strains as encapsulaed than does serotyping (reaction of serum with antigen). With this in mind, strains that can be shown to be encapsulated without serotyping are sometimes referred to as \"highly encapsulated\" to distinguish them from strains that test positive for encapsulation through serotyping only. <\/p>\n\n<p>For discussions of capsule detection methods as applied to Staphylococcus aureus, see Sutra et al. (<a href=\"http://jcm.asm.org/content/28/3/447.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jcm.asm.org/content/28/3/447.full.pdf<\/a>) and O'riordan and Lee (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC321462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC321462/<\/a>).  O'riordan and Lee writes<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isolates belonging to the remaning serotypes produce nonmucoid\n  colonies on solid medium, and their colony morphology is\n  indistinguishable from that of strains lacking a capsule. Some\n  investigators have referred to nonmucoid, encapsulated S. aureus\n  isolates as microencapsulated to distinguish them from the atypical\n  mucoid strains.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, <strong>if both \"have capsular antigen\" and \"have a capsule\" is defined by a positive serotyping result for a capsular antigen, then all strains with a capsular antigen as detected by serotyping have a capsule per definition.<\/strong> If on the other hand you define encapsulation based on ink staining microscopy or colony morphology, there are definitely strains that produce K-antigens and don't qualify as \"encapsulated\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that while bacterial capsules consist mostly of polysaccharides, capsule proteins make up a second class of capsule antigens.

Then you take the top scoring sequences (you might use the E-value as a cutoff) and you can create a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) based on the occurrences of amino acids in all the columns of these alignments. This is allowed, because there is a high chance that these sequences are homologous to the query sequence and thus looking at the amino acids would give you a good sense of the variability in position that is allowed in the initial query sequence. The next step is to re-search the database for more hits. So now instead of searching with a sequence, you are searching with a profile, and you get another set of hits. You can iterate a few times which would give you a much more sensitive search.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vmzik.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":15492,"question_id":15478,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1393978642},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":15496,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394000370,"comment_id":20808,"body":"Hi !

It is discussed that post-translational modifications as phosphorylation and ubiquitination play an important role here.<\/p>\n\n<p>The degradation seems to take place at the formed channels. This was tested in two ways: When the export of new proteins to the membrane is inhibited, then the connexins in the membrane and the junctions get lost over time. If the proteasome is inhibited, the number is growing. And when both pathways are inhibited (export and degradation) the number is approximately constant.

There are multiple theories explaining the phenomenon, most of them are related to accommodation or chromatic shift in scotopic light conditions when to light is focused before the fovea thus worsening the existing myopia.<\/p>\n\n<p>Citation:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In dark adaptation the eye becomes more sensitive to shorter wave\n  lengths (Purkinje shift- In the light-adapted eye the region of\n  maximal brightness is in the yellow; in the dark adapted eye, the\n  region of maximal brightness is in the green),and visual acuity\n  depends on parafoveal blue cones. Shorter wavelengths come into focus\n  in front of the retina, and this chromatic aberration accounts for\n  some of the relative myopia that a normal eye experiences at night;\n  much of the remainder is due to an increase in accommodative tone in\n  the dark.  It is also called dark focus of accommodation, or tonic\n  accommodation, or resting state of accommodation. Consequently, a\n  measurement of the refraction (i.e. the determination of appropriate\n  optical glasses to obtain good vision on these distant objects) gives\n  the result that the eye is myopic. Night myopia can reach values of up\n  to about - 4.0 D. Night myopia decreases with age31 and therefore it\n  can be of special importance for young drivers at night. In one\n  experiment with people aged 16 to 25 years, 38% had night myopia of -\n  0.75 D or more, and 4% had \u2013 2.50 D or more. Cause of Night Myopia:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Spherical aberration (The optical effect of the larger pupil decreases\n  the depth of focus) Chromatic aberration. Parkinje shift Ciliary spasm\n  At low light levels there is a change of the biochemistry of imaging\n  on the retina: in bright light the receptors in the retina are cones\n  with higher image acuity, and imaging of colors, whereas in low light\n  the receptors in the retina are rods with reduced image acuity, and\n  imaging of black and white only. The transition between both states,\n  i.e. to get maximum sensitivity when moving from the bright to the\n  dark, doesn't happen immediately, but takes some minutes33. This is a\n  problem e.g. when driving a car in sunlight and entering a tunnel. The\n  low light imaging by rods in the retina can be further reduced by a\n  lack of vitamin A and zinc Symptoms:\n  1. Blur vision only in low luminance.\n  2. Feeling discomfort while maintaining fixation in low illumination level.\n  3. Difficulty in night driving.\n  4.

I would run some network analysis to determine its characteristics, but seeing as it's a rather large network it would take more time than I have right now. The results are similar for two additional networks with interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans respectively downloaded from PINA.

As such, many of the interactions might not be biologically meaningful.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taking into account the above, you might want to define \"interacting proteins\" more precisely. One might expect that a better curated network only containing interactions with a known function or effect might give a different picture. However, using a more strigently constructed human \"functional interaction\" network published by Wu et al.

In your case, 220 is about 230, and 270 is about 280.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://greatneck.k12.ny.us/GNPS/SHS/dept/science/krauz/bio_h/images/15_06RecombLinkedGenes_L.jpg\" alt=\"testcross\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This image is just like your problem. I want you to imagine that b+ and b represent A and a in your problem and that vg+ and vg represent B and b in your problem, respectively. You start out with an AaBb crossed with an aabb. On the gametes line, it lists all of the possible gametes of this cross. On the line where it describes testcross offspring, we see a situation very similar to yours. In this case, AaBb = 965, aabb = 944, Aabb = 206, and aaBb = 185. We have our two pairs: AaBb/aabb and Aabb/aaBb. Sound familiar?<\/p>\n\n<p>The recombinant offspring are defined as the offspring that do not have a genotype of either parents. The reason this is important is because you need a crossover to get a recombinant. The closer two alleles are together on the same chromosome, the harder it is to get one of the alleles to cross over without the other one crossing over with it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let's clarify. This means that if the alleles are closer, you get less crossovers. All recombinant exist because of a crossover. Therefore, the closer two alleles are, the less recombinants you get. <\/p>\n\n<p>Quick note: the formula for the distance two alleles are from each other is expressed by this formula: <\/p>\n\n<p>100(recombinant frequency) / (total offspring) = distance apart.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is consistant with everything we have said, because as recombinant frequency decreases, distance apart decreases as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another way to explain it: on the gametes, AB and ab really like to stay together, as they are LINKED. It is very difficult to separate them. That is why there are more AaBb and aabb; they only require the gametes AB and ab.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apply the formula to find out how far they are apart. I think you can figure out the rest from here. I want you to try and answer the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helped! :)<\/p>\n","answer_id":15410,"question_id":15408,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15408/genetics-independent-assortment","last_activity_date":1393572497,"creation_date":1393565384,"answer_count":1,"title":"Genetics independent assortment?","body":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h1bCu.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As indicated in this question, what do you think is is the best explanation for the observed progeny, is it because distance between genes affects recombination frequency?

If you bundle up chromosomes to polyploids, then you get the additional assumption of random mating, e.g. all pairs of individuals are equally likely to reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>I might have missed something, but these assumptions should be sufficient to generate the Wright-Fisher-Dynamics: When we build a new generation, we have to fill $N$ spots again (follows from the first two assumptions). As each old individual is equally likely to reproduce (third assumption), e.g. to become parent of a new individual, we get the multinomial offspring distribution.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main difference in the <strong>Moran model<\/strong> is that it assumes overlapping generations.

What you are perhaps alluding to is that an adverse effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy used in the medical treatment of cancer can cause immunosuppression. <\/p>\n\n<p>Immunosuppression is helpful when it is causing more harm than good. The immune system is powerful and sometimes when its fighting an infection it can go a little overboard and cause enough damage to harm someone in the long term. In this case immunosuppression is helpful in preventing too high a response. For example in an organ transplant the recipient's immune system may destroy the new organ, but immunosuppression can prevent rejection. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another case is when there is an autoimmune or inflammatory condition occurring. Rheumatoid arthritis being an example of the former and asthma being an example of the latter. In these diseases inflammation due to the immune system perhaps targeting our own body cells causes damage to our organs or cells and causes the disease. Immunosuppression here can limit or prevent further degradation or sometimes even reverse damage due to inappropriate immune responses. <\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly the human body must keep a good balance between being under and overactive.

It was usually tried anyway because its possible that the patients belong to this 20% which respond. If not, treatment was usually not prolonged. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think its something similiar here. The other problem for chemotherapy is that it is cytotoxic (until we got the small molecule inhibitors which are tested and used today) and the problem is to kill the cancer cells (all when possible) while you leave the rest of the body as unaffected as possible. To get this balance is hard (people tend to react differently to chemotherapy). The other problem is that cancers are not homogenous. So its possible that 99.9% of the cells present respond to chemotherapy and get killed, while a few acquired an additional mutation, which gives them an advantage.
