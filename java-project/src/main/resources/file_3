I am answering to this question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Neutral mutations and nearly neutral mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The probability of fixation of a new neutral mutation is $P_{neutral}=\\frac{1}{2N}$, where $N$ is the population size. An intuitive way to understand why this is true is that, after an infinite amount of time (constant population size and in absence of speciation), the whole population will necessarily descend from a single individual. In absence of selection pressure every single individual has the same probability to be the ancestor. As a fraction of $\\frac{1}{2N}$ of the population is carrying the mutant allele when it first occur, then the probability that his allele reaches fixation is $\\frac{1}{2N}$. In fact, this result can be generalize to say that the probability of fixation of a neutral mutation present at frequency $p$ at a given time in the population has a probability $P_{neutral}=p$ to get fixed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given the selection coefficient $s$, a good approximation is that whenever $2Ns&lt;&lt;1$, then the probability of fixation is essentially not different from $P_{neutral}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>This qualitative boundary ($2Ns&lt;&lt;1$ or $2Ns&gt;&gt;1$) is the boundary you were interested in. In your post you talk about \"percentage advantage\". This percentage advantage is just $s\\cdot 100$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Beneficial mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For \"significantly\" beneficial mutations, a good approximation to the probability of fixation of a newly arisen mutation given $s$ and $N$ is <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{1-e^{-s}}{1-e^{-2Ns}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Source of information<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Your question shows a few misunderstanding and is nested within the field of population genetics.

The neurons innervating the muscles involved in respiration deteriorate and so it becomes difficult to breath, swallow, cough, etc. There's a compounding effect: we know that blood O2 and CO2 levels are balanced by respiration, O2 in/CO2 out, and we know that swallowing/coughing clear secretions from the respiratory tract. Basically you end up with trouble oxygenating your blood and riding it of CO2, hence CO2 poisoning. This can result in what is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure#Type_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">type 2 respiratory failure<\/a>, characterized by low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels (hypoxemia and hypercapnia). Low secretion clearance in the lungs can also result in aspiration pneumonia in addition to poor gas exchange.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ventilation methods such as BCV are capable of mechanically assisting breathing, and maintaining ventilation-perfusion state in a way that prevents respiratory failure, but unfortunately doesn't slow the progression of the disease. The problem then is that in, for example, particularly severe cases, the quality of life has to be taken into account because tongue movement, gross movement in general due to motor neuron degeneration just fails. This can lead to what is essentially locked-in syndrome (LIS), and clinical outcomes can widely vary, though in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818912\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> they report the more pleasant outcomes of patients experiencing LIS. I think that for these cases due to poor communicaton patient-reported outcomes are fairly underreported, but family and caregivers at this point have to take into serious consideration options such as euthanasia. Cutting off ventilation can result in type 1 or 2 respiratory failure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, I lack actual data for this statement but I should also point out that not all patients receive the same care or opt for assisted ventilation, in which case late-stage ALS would invariably lead to total neurodegeneration to breathing muscle innervation, where assisted ventilation becomes a <em>requirement<\/em> for survival.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43165,"question_id":43163,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1461537095}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43163/what-is-it-that-specifically-kills-als-patients","last_activity_date":1461537095,"creation_date":1455033091,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is it that specifically kills ALS patients?","body":"<p>ALS is a fatal motor neuron disease, and even though there are <a href=\"http://www.healthboards.com/boards/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als/281184-how-exactly-does-als-kill-you.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">many<\/a> <a href=\"https://www.healthtap.com/topics/what-finally-kills-an-als-patient\" rel=\"nofollow\">different<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/research/about-als-research/disease-process-of-als.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">articles<\/a> out there on the topic \"<em>How does ALS actually kill you?<\/em>\", none of them really delve deep enough into biology to adequately answer the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, many articles cite \"<em>respiratory failure<\/em>\", or \"<em>CO2 poisoning<\/em>\".

Now the question has been revised to focus on tissue transplantation, where the cells do contain foreign DNA, my amended answer deals with a couple of the points raised, but only briefly with the question of identification.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Incorporation of foreign DNA into the human genome<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is extremely unlikely that any of the DNA from the tissue of the donor would be incorporated into the DNA of the cells of the recipient. The donor cells would have to be broken (i.e. die) to release the DNA, which is most likely to be degraded in the process. Even if it survived it would then have to be taken up by the host cells, which is unlikely as there is no specific mechanism to allow this. However if foreign DNA somehow got to the nucleus it would need specific machinery to be incorporated into the host DNA. This involves enzymes making staggered cuts in the foreign and host DNA to allow annealing and enzymes to ligate the two together. We know about this sort of thing because retroviruses and viruses that can exist in the genome in a latent state have specific mechanisms for doing this. It is unlikely to happen just by chance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if foreign DNA did get incorporated, it still has to be in an environment that allows it to be expressed (appropriate promoters). A more likely possibility is insertion in a position that affects a host gene. This can result in uncontrolled division of cells, i.e. they become cancerous, and is a problem that has been encountered using viruses of the type mentioned to insert genes into genomes in gene therapy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do the differences in the DNA of transplanted tissue matter?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously differences in the DNA of different individuals has an effect on the individual. It is genetic differences that cause people to differ in size, shape, features, hair colour etc. Oh, and some are girls and some are boys. But when the tissues and organs have finished developing it probably doesn't matter if a piece of transplanted liver is from a male or female donor. The genetic programme that causes sexual differentiation and function isn't the one being expressed in the adult liver. The genes that are being expressed are those for the enzymes the liver needs to play its metabolic role (too numerous to list), and if they work, they work, even if the proteins differ in amino acid sequence by the odd amino acid that doesn\u2019t impair its function. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem of identification by DNA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I would have thought that this would not really be a problem. After all, if you want to take a DNA sample from a person you can do it with hair roots, white blood cells or scrapings from mouth skin. You wouldn't need to resort to liver biopsies and the like. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Doctor of Philosophy<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I can see there is a general philosophical concern over who one is if one has tissue or organs from another donor, but until we have brain transplantation I\u2019m not going to worry about that. (And when that comes, I won\u2019t be answering questions on the subject.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":45554,"question_id":45506,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1461523429}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45506/how-two-genomes-adopt-when-cell-goes-to-recipients-body-from-donors-body","last_activity_date":1461523429,"creation_date":1461369244,"answer_count":1,"title":"How two genomes adopt when cell goes to recipient's body from donor's body?","body":"<p>We often give blood to another following the blood giving compatibility chart.

There are two interesting classes of exceptions, but they are exceptions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is that mutations can and do occur in cells during their growth.  Most of these are probably neutral - they occur in the vast wasteland of genetic junk in the chromosome, and nothing happens.  But some of them are harmful, and this is what puts cells on the pathway toward cancer.  Outright cancers, that we can detect, are the result of at least a half-dozen mutations occurring in the same cell lineage, that cumulatively allow the cells in that lineage to grow in uncontrolled manner, to avoid immune clearance, to encourage their own blood vessel growth, and so on.  (In fact, cancer cells generally have far more than a half-dozen mutations, because a route toward getting the mutations they need is to turn down DNA repair, allowing mutations to accumulate with minimal control.  For example, <a href=\"http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/index.php?journal=oncotarget&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=8196&amp;path%5B%5D=24219\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genomic landscape of DNA repair genes in cancer<\/a>, <a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2016/02/27/0008-5472.CAN-15-1015.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genomic profiling of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals a changing mutational landscape from disease diagnosis to relapse.<\/a>)  <\/p>\n\n<p>The second set of exceptions is in the immune system.  Both B cells and T cells specifically modify their chromosomes during their development, making huge numbers (trillions) or new genes.  The catch is that these are all in the same region, the antibody or T cell receptor genes.  It's part of the mechanism by which the adaptive immune system \"remembers\" which pathogens it's interacted with in the past.

Haemoglobinopathies affecting the beta globin chain are found in malarial regions of the world. Two major examples are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sickle Cell Anaemia<\/a> in malarial regions of Africa, and the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000587.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">thalessaemias<\/a> (especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_thalassemia\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta-thalessaemia<\/a>) in the Southern Mediterranean regions of Europe (especially Italy and Greece) where there were malarial mosquito swamps. These conditions were therefore assumed to somehow provide resistance against malaria.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key thing about these diseases is that it is the heterozygote that is protected from malaria and only suffers mildly from the disease (or may even show no symptoms) The homozygote, in contrast, is generally badly effected and may have a poor life expectancy. The explanation is that in the heterozygote the amount of functional haemoglobin is reduced to half, but that is sufficient in normal circumstances. (Sickle cell anaemia is more complex, but in principle similar.) However for <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110428123931.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">reasons<\/a> that are more complex than one might expect, the pathogenicity of the parasite is decreased in such individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you will be aware, the haemoglobin molecule in adult humans is made up of two alpha-chains and two beta-chains, each of which can bind an oxygen molecule. Why then are most haemoglobinopathies due to mutations involving the beta-chain? One answer may be that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_hemoglobin\" rel=\"nofollow\">foetal haemoglobin<\/a> has a different structure \u2014 two alpha-chains and two gamma-chains. (This shifts its oxygen affinity in a manner appropriate for its relation between foetal and maternal circulations.) Hence mutations in alpha-globin could lead to still births, and in fact these are prevalent in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-thalassemia\" rel=\"nofollow\">alpha-thalassaemia<\/a>. As the foetal haemoglobin lacks beta-chains, this problem does not arise in beta-haemoglobinopathies.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a native of Northern Europe, I had tended to think of the problem of thalassaemia in Southern Europe as something that had disappeared long ago. This idea was dispelled last summer when I chanced on a thalassaemia centre in Ferrara in Italy. The upper plaque shown is a tribute to a doctor at the centre, and the second plaque would probably be expressed in English as \u201cCity of Ferrara Genetic Counselling Clinic for Thalassaemia\u201d.

[which to me, seems incorrect too since both lime water and potassium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide and then there is no need to use potassium hydroxide when lime water works!]<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Now I am confused what is correct and what should I write in my final examination??

That energy is then released when required to power other reactions, which is how a plant lives and grows. C is also incorporated into all the organic molecules in the plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plants require several things to live: CO2, light, water and minerals. If any of those things is missing for a sustained period, growth will suffer. Most molecules in a plant require some carbon, which comes originally from CO<sub>2<\/sub>, and also an assortment of other elements which come from the mineral nutrients in the soil. So the plant is completely reliant on minerals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most plants, before a leaf is established or roots develop, grow using energy and nutrients stored in the endosperm and cotyledons of the seed. I whipped up a rough diagram below. Cotyledons are primitive leaves inside the seed. The endosperm is a starchy tissue used only for storage of nutrients and energy. The radicle is the juvenile root. The embryo is the baby plant.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/F80Hu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>When the seed germinates the embryo elongates, the endosperm depletes, the testa ruptures, and the cotyledons emerge from the seed. The cotyledons are green, and like leaves can photosynthesise, so as soon as they are in the light the plant is able to make carbon compounds. The radicle elongates at the same time, and becomes the root, so the plant is very quickly able to obtain fresh nutrients from the soil (or whatever it's growing in).<\/p>\n\n<p>At all stages of a plant's life it is using both energy stored in carbon compounds (from CO<sub>2<\/sub>) and nutrients which it took up via its roots. At no point does the plant start to depend solely on the CO<sub>2<\/sub> in the air for its growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are right that the way in which plants acquire energy and nutrients prior to leaves and roots being established varies between plants. Above I outlined the way <em>most<\/em> plants use. But there are lots of variations. For example, orchids have very tiny seeds, some barely visible to the naked eye, like specks of dust. They have no endosperm or storage tissue, so they have to rely on a symbiotic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza\">mycorrhizal fungus<\/a> to get carbon and nutrients. The fungus grows through the coat of the orchid seed, then provides everything the growing plant needs until it has its own leaves. Then the orchid repays the fungus by providing sugars.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of other examples, but we could go on all day! <\/p>\n","answer_id":1042,"question_id":1041,"up_vote_count":19,"last_edit_date":1329232294},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7701772ef9468d89e35dfc8d49f2fb92?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9910,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9910/thaina","reputation":241,"display_name":"Thaina"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1461441203,"creation_date":1461441203,"body":"<p>Simply put.

I feel it will become more common as the use of wood-chip as a mulch persists, as it loves to colonise this habitat.

Just before it cracks open hexagonal lines can be seen along which the skin splits. The bright orange net-like spherical body emerges, and the inside of this is lined with a slimy dark brown substance called gleba. This has a most revolting smell, which will attract flies.

I mixed the plasmid and oligos and ligated, then transformed into bacteria, all standard stuff.<\/p>\n\n<p>The HinDIII version worked the first time, with few colonies on the empty vector control plate, and more colonies on the plates that received oligos during the ligation.

The empty vector control and all other plates are a just a carpet of cells. There are very few individual colonies, and the ones that exist don't look right, too small. I haven't even tried a miniprep, too likely to get an empty vector back. I did do a nontransformed control, where the cells were not given any DNA and were just directly plated. Those cells died, indicating it's not an issue with my ampicillin. <\/p>\n\n<p>My hypothesis is that unligated empty vector outnumbers the correctly ligated plasmids, and that cells that pick up a copy of the unligated DNA somehow repair the cut, even though it's dephosphorylated. This is made more likely because I only used a single digest, so the plasmid has matching sticky ends, however the HinDIII version used the same strategy. I have been including a 1 hour 37 C SOC media incubation, which could allow the bacteria more time to carry out this repair. If I skip the incubation, maybe that would prevent unwanted repair.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am testing this hypothesis with some additional controls, including transforming bacteria with empty vector that hasn't been treated with ligase to make sure the ligation reaction isn't the problem, as well as using the previously ligated DNA without the SOC incubation. I will report that data as it becomes available. I am short on competent cells, so I can't do much else right now.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, what do you think about treating the ligated DNA with klenow to blunt any remaining sticky ends before transformation?<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have the data for the transformations that skipped the ligation and SOC media incubation.

By \"superior\" I suppose you would refer to a species that could outcompete all the other. This sounds very impossible to me firstly for simple ecological reasons. However, it would be a long answer to fully address this point and I don't feel like addressing (I might not be very much able to) in addition to the other questions.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Evolution vs Natural Selection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Just for a start. Evolution is way more than just Natural selection. There are plenty of other absolutely essential processes such as mutation and drift that are important to understand.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Natural Selection?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Natural selection is the process by which most fit individuals end up being at higher frequency in the population as a result of reproducing more and surviving better. Natural selection does not necessarily diminish the probability of a species to get extinct. It will not necessarily increase the ability of a species to compete another. It will not necessarily increase the rate of increase in the number of individuals in the species.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>local vs global optima<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Reading you post you seem to understand the concept of local vs global optimum (from algorithmic maybe). If selection alone was acting in the population and if mutations were feeding genetic variation to this population at a low enough rate, then population will ultimately reach a local optimum and will get stuck there forever. They would never reach a potential higher local optimum somewhere else. Drift may allow for such switch though, it is refer to \"shifting balance theory\". <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Envrionmental change<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The environment changes much faster at a local scale that you seem to think. When talking about environmental change for a lineage, we are not only talking about important ice age or current days global warming but we are talking about more subtle and more frequent changes. Imagine a species of unicellular living in a 50 cubic centimeter puddle. For them environmental change are drastic and frequent. So do population really have time to achieve any equilibrium. It is here a general question that comes in many field of evolutionary biology and also outside biology. Are the system that we study expected to be at equilibrium (in regards at some variables at least) in nature or are they never given the time to reach any equilibrium?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutations and drift<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Mutation and drift are stochastic processes in evolutionary biology (among others). Mutations is the ultimate production of genetic variation. Most mutations are deleterious but not all are. The exact mutation (and mutational effects) and number of mutations that will occur in a population in a given amount of time is a stochastic process. Genetic drift refers to the random sampling of individuals that are chosen to survive. Drift is inversely proportional to the population size and you may want to have a look at <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a> to get some intuition for why this is the case.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How much fitness is lost du to ever occurring mutations?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As mutations are always occuring we might wonder how far is a population from its optimum due to these deleterious mutations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's consider a very simple model.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let $p$ be the frequency of the wild-type (not mutant) allele, $s$ be the deleterious effect of the mutation in the homozygote mutant and $h\\cdot s$ be the deleterious effect in the heterozygote. The mean relative fitness in the population is <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\bar w =  1 - 2 p (1-p) h s - (1-p)^2s$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's define the mutation load $L$ as $1-\\bar w$. As a consequence<\/p>\n\n<p>$$L = 2 p (1-p) h s - (1-p)^2s$$<\/p>\n\n<p>At selection-drift equilibrium the expected frequency of $p$ is $p=\\frac{\\mu}{hs}$, where $\\mu$ is the mutation rate. As a consequence the<\/p>\n\n<p>$$L = 2\\mu$$\nand\n$$\\bar w = 1- 2\\mu$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's assume that fitness effect at different loci are multiplicative (no epistasis). As a consequence an individual carrying $n$ deleterious mutations has a fitness of<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\prod_{i=1}^n 1-s_i $$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's further assume that all mutations have the same deleterious effect on fitness, that is $s_1=s_2=...=s_n=s$. Let $l$ be the number of nucleotides on which deleterious mutations can occur. Coming back to $w=1-2\\mu$, we can say that over all loci in the genome the fitness is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\bar w = \\prod (1-2\\mu) ≈ e^{-\\sum_{i=0}^l 2 \\mu} = e^{-2\\mu l} = e^{-U}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>, where $U=2\\mu l$ is the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate. According to best estimates, in humans $U≈2.2$ and therefore our load is $L = 1-e^{-2.2} ≈ 0.9$.<\/p>\n\n<p>From this simple model, we would expect that 90% of the mean fitness of a population is lost due to ever recurring deleterious mutations. This sounds pretty big and suggest that we'll always be pretty far way from an actual optimum.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45475,"question_id":45468,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXPhP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12923,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12923/alec-djinn","reputation":647,"display_name":"alec_djinn"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1461411337,"creation_date":1461322179,"body":"<p>The short answer is NO.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here, very briefly (since it would take to much to properly analyze all the aspects of this topic), is why:<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, the environment is constantly changing so there will be no such thing like 'the end of evolution'.

When I googled for it I got pages with statements that obligate anaerobic bacteria still had the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase as there were different electron acceptors other than oxygen. Yes, we know that things are different in thermal vents and hot springs, but what about gas gangrene? I am not a microbiologist, but I did play with the metabolism of some bacteria for a biochemical bioinformatics lab some years ago, so I can give two instances where anaerobic bacteria appear to lack either the ETC or both the ETC and ATP synthase.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Clostridium perfringens<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is the anaerobic fermenting bacterium that leads to gas gangrene in infected wounds and was a major cause of limb loss and mortality in the First World War. The <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/99/2/996.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">DNA sequence of Clostridium perfringens<\/a> has been determined. I quote at length from the paper as it describes the fermentation, but italicise the key statement for those who wish to skip this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>We could not find any genes coding for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle- or respiratory-chain-related proteins<\/em>, in contrast to C. acetobutylicum, which has incomplete TCA cycle enzymes. Similar to C. acetobutylicum, we could construct a pathway map for anaerobic fermentation resulting in the production of lactate, alcohol, acetate, and butyrate, all of which have been commonly detected in C. perfringens cultures. In the fermentation pathway, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (CPE2061), producing CO<sub>2<\/sub> gas and reduced ferredoxin. Electrons from the reduced ferredoxin are transferred to protons by hydrogenase (CPE2346), resulting in the formation of hydrogen molecules (H<sub>2<\/sub>) that are released from the cell together with CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The related bacterium, Clostridium acetobutylicum, mentioned in the extract, is also an obligate anaerobe. (It ferments a variety of plant mono- and poly-saccharides to acetone, butanol and ethanol \u2014 used to produce explosives in the First World War.) Although it has some enzymes of the TCA-cycle, it is unable to use the cycle oxidatively, and, like Clostridium perifringens, lacks the enzymes of the electron transport chain and an ATP synthase.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ureaplasma urealyticum (Ureaplasma parvum)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This micro-organism is a micoplasma (Mollicute) rather than a bacterium \u2014 i.e. it lacks a cell wall. It infects the human urogenital tract. It lacks the components of an electron transport chain but does possess a functional ATP synthase.

I will consider a basic (simplified) model of a honeybee colony and describe it a little bit to try to address your question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Simplified Model of a ant colony<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In general, a queen can have several mates. The queen is storing the sperm of these males in her spermatheca. As you noted, the queen is diploid while the males are haploids. The queen will use the stored sperm for all of her life. Each egg that is fertilized will give rise to a worker. Although, a worker does not reproduce (in our simplified model), a worker is still considered a female for morphological reasons. At some point in the life of the colony, some larvea that could have become workers are fed with royal jelly and they will then develop into queen. These queens will fly away to mate with multiple males and make up a new colony. The queen also produce males. The males are haploids. The queen only uses her own gametes to make up a male.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Relatedness<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In our simplified colony, a male has no father and has the same mother than any other male and any other worker. Two workers may or may not have the same father. Let's imagine to simplify the story that the queen mated with a single male so that all the workers have the same parents (they are sisters).<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>queen-worker: 1/2<\/li>\n<li>worker-worker: 1/2\n\n<ul>\n<li>This relatedness decreases with the number of father.

Indeed if workers are more closely related to their sisters than to their brothers we might think that they would tend to bias the sex-ratio of the colony toward more sisters to a degree that would not be optimal for the queen. The degree of relatedness between workers depends on the number of fathers. There more fathers there are, the lower is the relatedness among workers and the lower is the incentive to bias the sex-ratio. As a consequence, while the queen would wish a sex-ratio of 0.5, the workers will deviate this sex-ratio toward more workers with a strength that is decreasing with the number of father.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have some trouble with these predictions (that I won't express here) but empirical evidences support that the sex-ratio differ depending on the number of fathers (and therefore on the worker - worker relatedness).<\/p>\n","answer_id":45510,"question_id":45507,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45507/how-genetically-similar-are-worker-ants-from-the-same-colony","last_activity_date":1461397929,"creation_date":1461390965,"answer_count":1,"title":"How genetically similar are worker ants from the same colony?","body":"<p>I've been reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant<\/a> and it says<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female diploid; if not, it will be male haploid.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the males have only one set of chromosomes to pass on to the queen, all of their direct offspring (which can only be female) will contain all of their DNA.

The ants will lay a pheromone trail, by tapping their abdomen on the ground, like breadcrumbs. If the ant has found a food source, they will taste the food and take part of the food and store it in their crop. The ant will take the food sample and re-trace her trail, making it more detectable when returning to the food source. Once the ant reached the nest and finds another ant, she will regurgitate the food from her crop and position it between her mandibles.

Enzymes are highly choosy molecules so that they only perform the work they're made for. In digestion, enzymes like proteases (for breaking down proteins), lipases (for breaking down lipids), amylases (for breaking down starch), DNAses (for breaking down DNA), etc. are involved. For example, amylase is specialized to break down polysaccharides (carbohydrate polymers) into mono/di/tri/oligo-saccharides. See this from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The α-amylases are calcium metalloenzymes, completely unable to function in the absence of calcium. By acting at random locations along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain carbohydrates, ultimately yielding maltotriose and maltose from amylose, or maltose, glucose and \"limit dextrin\" from amylopectin.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And this image from <a href=\"http://www.biotek.com/resources/articles/enzymatic-digestion-of-polysaccharides-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fz6mF.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fz6mF.jpg\" alt=\"amylase working\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Lets forget the \"completely unable to function in absence of calcium\" part as it is out of the scope of this question. But it is necessary to know how specialized enzymes are to answer your question. They are so specialized that amylase can break starch, but not cellulose. See this image:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EeuBs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EeuBs.jpg\" alt=\"starch, cellulose and glycogen\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bankofbiology.blogspot.in/2014/07/comparison-between-starch-glycogen-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>You must have noticed, in the diagram above, the minute difference between starch, cellulose and glycogen (BTW glycogen is another polysaccharide), but even that difference is enough for enzymes to tear apart one and pass on the other molecule.<\/p>\n\n<p>The above explanation was necessary to tell why the answer is no. If we eat something, enzymes are needed to break it down. But if enzymes cannot recognize something, then they can simply not work on it. So, if you even want to eat space grass, forget about being able to digest it. Because even if we confirm that life on earth came from space through meteorites billions of years ago, then also during this time period of billions of years both that life of space and this life on earth would have evolved so much that they might not match, even chemically!<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.

Viruses are obligate parasites, and while plenty of parasites are indeed living what sets viruses apart is that they always rely on the host for the <em>machinery<\/em> with which to replicate.  A parasitic worm may need the host to survive, using the host as a source for energy, but the worm produces and synthesizes its own proteins using its own ribosomes and associated complexes.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's basically what it boils down to.  No ribosomes?  Not living.   One advantage of this definition, for example, is that it is a positive selection (everyone \"alive\" has got ribosomes) which eliminates things like mitochondria that are sort of near the boundary of other definitions.  There are examples on either side of something that breaks every other rule but not this one.  Another common rule is metabolism and while that suffices for most cases some living parasites have lost metabolic activity, relying on their host for energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>However (and this is the really interesting part) even the ribosome definition is a bit shaky, especially as viruses have been found encoding things like their own tRNAs.  Here are a few points to think about:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We have ribosome encoding organisms (REOs), so why can't we define viruses as capsid encoding organisms (CEOs)?<\/li>\n<li>Comparing viruses to a living organism such as a human is absurd, given the massive differences in complexity.  A virus, really, is just a vehicle or genetic material, and would be more rightly compared to a sperm cell.  Is a sperm cell alive, or is it a package for genetic material that is <em>capable<\/em> of life once it has infected/fertilized another cell?<\/li>\n<li>The really large DNA viruses often create cytoplasmic features called virus factories.  These look an awful lot like a nucleus.  What is a nucleus anyway?  Maybe it's just a very successful DNA virus that never left.<\/li>\n<li>Viruses can get <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_virophage\" rel=\"nofollow\">viruses<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I'll wind down here, but suffice to say that while our current definition may have sufficed for a while, and still does, it is no longer quite solid.

It refers to \u201cthe body\u201d leading you to assume it\u2019s a specific body \u2014 yours. I'm sure there are better definitions, but just taking this one, I would modify to: \u201cA substance that <em>can be<\/em> recognised as foreign and evoke an immune response in an organism.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>With this definition, which is actually how antigens are thought of, a particular antigen need not be antigenic in every organism to which it is presented. Those organisms or individuals for which the antigen appears as \u2018self\u2019 will not recognize it as foreign as they are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance#Central_tolerance\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2018tolerant\u2019<\/a> to it (e.g. by mechanisms which eliminate the cells capable of producing antibodies against the self antigen). But it is still referred to as an antigen.<\/p>\n\n<p>So your understanding of the situation is correct, but that of the use of the terminology is not. Even if you belong to blood group A and therefore will not mount an immune response to the pink blobs in the picture when transfused with blood of group A, they are still referred to as antigens as they stimulate an immune response when transfused into a person of blood group B.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you wished to talk about the fact that the A antigen on blood of type A does not provoke an immune response when transfused to persons with blood group A you could say \u201cThe A antigen on red cells is not immunogenic (or even antigenic) when transfused into persons of blood group A\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Footnote on terminology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Scientific terminology allows us to describe things precisely. As our understanding increases, the terminology may need to evolve to allow us to make distinctions of which we were previously unaware. The word \u2018antigen\u2019 was coined in the late 19th century, before anything was known of the structure of antibodies, and was defined in terms of the immune response as that was what was observed. The definition evolved in some quarters to include the idea of binding to an antibody or T-cell (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam-Webster definition<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>However this extended definition raises the problem of the terminology to use if something binds to an antibody but does not provoke an immune response. Thus, the Glossary of the textbook <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10757/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immunobiology (Janeway <em>et al.<\/em>)<\/a> defines antigen as \u201cAny molecule that can bind specifically to an antibody\u201d and uses a different term, \u2018immunogen\u2019, for \u201cAny molecule that can elicit an adaptive immune response on injection into a person or animal\u201d.

Other softwares are available and they are each evaluated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP\" rel=\"nofollow\">CASP<\/a> every two years since 1994.<\/p>\n\n<p>In homology modelling there are 3 common scoring systems that can be used to assess the biochemical viability of a model. <a href=\"https://salilab.org/archives/modeller_usage/2013/msg00016.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This email<\/a> covers when to use each one. My answer expands and explains a bit more.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://salilab.org/modeller/9.11/manual/node468.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>molpdf<\/strong><\/a> is the Modeller objective function.\n<strong>GA341<\/strong>, discussed <a href=\"http://salilab.org/pdf/John_NucleicAcidsRes_2003.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> is derived from  Z-score (calculated with a statistical potential\nfunction), which is a target-template sequence identity, and a\nmeasure of structural compactness. \n<strong>DOPE<\/strong> is a more up to date method, first published in 2006, and is more true to \"biological viability\". From <a href=\"http://salilab.org/pdf/Shen_ProteinSci_2006.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the publication<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>DOPE is based on an improved reference\n  state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on\n  a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Which to use depends on what you want to do with the model, but of those three scores, DOPE is the most reliable at separating native-like models from \"decoys\".  DOPE is usually the starting place for figuring out which models might be right and which models are just plain rubbish.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> If you use Rosetta then there will be equivalents to these, or you can run your generated models through these techniques. If you are using <a href=\"http://swissmodel.expasy.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">SWISS MODEL<\/a> that comes with it's own somewhat black box verification techniques but you can still export the model for further verification.<\/p>\n\n<h2>General model check against experimental data.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Although the above are based on experimental evidence and can be applied to any given structure if you know how, sometimes you might not have used homology methods (such as <em>ab initio<\/em> modelling) or want to do another quick check before more sensitive verification. I find that <a href=\"https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>ProSA<\/strong><\/a> provides a great visual representation of where the z-score lies amongst actual structures. There are probably others that do similar functions, but this is my personal go-to.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sensitive residue by residue verification.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Although the aforementioned methods examine each residue, they usually output an overall score. Residue by residue scores are also available and require a lot of careful interpretation. For example if you are analysing catalytic activity, a surface looping region that scores poorly might not be an issue, but a core catalytic residue that scores poorly renders the model useless.

An acquired trait cannot affect DNA sequence directly and therefore cannot be inherited genetically by the offspring (this sentence is the answer to your question).

For example, a dam that a beaver transmits to its offspring, a good habitat that the parents had to fight for.

Environmental change that an individual has caused (niche construction) of fighted for can potentially be inherited by the offspring<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cultural<\/strong>. For example a language, a method to hunt seals or a method to clean potatoes. Cultural modifications acquired by an individual can potentially transmitted to the offspring<\/li>\n<li><strong>Epigenetics<\/strong>. It includes any modification over the DNA and histones and any content of the egg. Something an individual has lived can affect the types of epigenetic modifications that a parent can transmit to its offspring.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Genetic and epigenetic characteristics can be exclusively transmitted from parent to offspring (setting aside horizontal gene transfer and transduction), while environmental characteristics and cultural characteristics can potentially inherited between any two individuals.

The speeding RNA polymerase might disrupt the loops instead. The termination system for DNA replication <em>may<\/em> have evolved to be much more robust so as to be able to bring faster elongation to a stop. (Note: my suggestion of different \u2018robustness\u2019 in termination is not based on any data, it's pure speculation.)<\/p>\n\n<p>If this were true, it would beg the question of why transcription hasn't evolved a more efficient termination system in concert with the a evolution of a smarter RNA polymerase. Perhaps the answer here is that there is no selective pressure for faster transcription \u2014 the rate is clearly sufficient to supply the needs of the cell \u2014 whereas the rate of DNA replication determines the time between cell divisions and thus the rate of growth, which is subject to selective pressure.<\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><em>Perhaps<\/em> it has something to do with error frequency in relation to selective pressure for speed in the two processes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>First I'll make it clear that I think the proofreading argument in the question is a bit of a red herring. If the rate replication is 20x as fast as transcription, the occasional backtracking will not have much effect on the overall difference. However errors and proofreading could be involved in a different explanation. <\/p>\n\n<p>RNA transcription does not have proof-reading. The length of RNA transcripts is such that the cell can tolerate the errors that occur. However if the speed transcription were increased it is reasonable to expect an increase in error frequency, which might be detrimental. The current rate of transcription may be a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Of course one can imagine a proof-reading system for transcription evolving if it were necessary, but, as discussed above, if the rate of transcription is adequate there would seem to be no selective pressure to produce.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44513,"question_id":40195,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1458653817}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40195/why-and-how-is-dna-synthesis-so-much-faster-then-rna-synthesis","last_activity_date":1461247715,"creation_date":1446475665,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why and how is DNA synthesis so much faster then RNA synthesis?","body":"<p><strong>DNA<\/strong> synthesis in E. coli is <strong>20x faster<\/strong> than <strong>RNA<\/strong> synthesis at <strong>1000nt/s vs 50nt/s<\/strong>. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Mirkin'05)<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I find that perplexing since DNA polymerization has better <em>proofreading<\/em> than the RNA variety, which requires extra time as you need to backtrack, excise, and replace.

The setup of the electrochemical gradient across membrane, like any thermodynamic process is not perfect, there are always entropy losses. In this case, this manifests as the the diffusion of protons away from the membrane (one source, there are others). Note the connection between entropy of system (Mitochondria) and diffusion (the inefficient process) in this positive feedback process. I think its interesting as someone learning about this stuff to make these connections.<\/p>\n\n<p>Recalling protons are being delivered freely into the environment (inter membrane space) by Electron Transport Chain. Some protons will diffuse away from membrane surface before they can be pumped back in since these highly charged species cannot passively diffuse back in. The chemiosmosis process, which is sustained by the energy input to drive ATP synthase, depends on maintaining a strong concentration gradient (separation) of H<sup>+<\/sup> on either side of membrane. Since the outer membrane of the mitochondria is porous, it means the protons are free to diffuse out, and will do so because it is entropically favorable. This relationship is best described by $\\ce{\\Delta G = RTln(K)}$. Where $\\ce{K=\\cfrac{[B]}{[A]}}$ for a process $\\ce{A \\rightleftharpoons  B}$ <\/p>\n\n<p>Where <strong>A<\/strong>= Protons near membrane, <strong>B<\/strong>= protons diffused out.

In other words, what determines the selection pressure to increase or reduce virulence?<\/p>\n\n<p>The most common definition of <strong>virulence<\/strong> in ecology is the <strong>reduction in host fitness resulting from infection by a pathogen<\/strong>. If reductions in host fitness also reduce the probability of successful transmission then there is selective pressure on the virus to become less virulent. Conversely, if reductions in host fitness make no difference (or actively increase the likelihood of transmission) then there is no selective pressure to reduce virulence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consequences of pathogen infection which increase the likelihood of transmission via certain routes often reduce host fitness (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_virulence#Trade-off_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">trade-off hypothesis<\/a>). For example, diarrhoea increases the potential for faeco-oral transmission of the pathogen but increases the host's risk of death from dehydration. Differences in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_virulence\" rel=\"nofollow\">optimal virulence<\/a> reflect differences in the degree to which host and pathogen fitness are correlated.

Let's talk about them one at a time.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nqNkW.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nqNkW.jpg\" alt=\"Blood-Brain Barrier\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Blood-brain barrier has its own side effects. Some major side effects are cerebral edema (accumulation of excess water in the extracellular space of the brain, which can result when hypoxia causes the blood\u2013brain barrier to open) and (possibly) Epilepsy. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier#Epilepsy\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> wikipedia article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood\u2013brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Another problem is that BBB doesn't allow passage of drugs, diagnostic and therapeutic agents through it. Again, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier#As_a_drug_target\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood\u2013brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and antibodies that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, if you want to know why the body doesn't have BBB-like barrier (not exactly BBB), then there are three parts of the answer.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>These kinds of barriers are highly specialized for a particular organ or organ system, which may not be useful for another organ/organ system. Also, creating specialized barriers for all the parts of the body will take a lot of energy, cells and even more time to develop completely. Possibly, in the evolutionary course, body preferred to have phagocytic cells circulating in the body instead of having specialized barriers throughout the body.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>These barriers might not be a total solution for immunity or restriction of pathogens. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier#HIV_encephalitis\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> part:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is believed that latent HIV can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream (\"Trojan horse theory\") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely attract the attention of sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, it is not necessary that those pathogens would infect only those tissues to which they reach via bloodstream. Pathogens like HIV cause infection in the blood cells. See this image from <a href=\"https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets/19/73/the-hiv-life-cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vUfPC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vUfPC.jpg\" alt=\"HIV life cycle\"><\/a>Once a person is infected with HIV, the virus begins to attack and destroy the CD4 cells of the immune system. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that play a major role in protecting the body from infection. HIV uses the machinery of the CD4 cells to multiply (make copies of itself) and spread throughout the body. This process, which includes seven steps or stages, is called the HIV life cycle.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote><\/li>\n<li><p>Similar barriers are already present in many parts of the body. For example- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93ocular_barrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blood-Ocular Barrier<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93testis_barrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blood-Testis Barrier<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=9540\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blood-Thymus Barrier<\/a>, etc. They may also have some loopholes.

But, as you would have seen in the list of factors, you must have noticed that photosynthesis also depends on a lot more factors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another crucial factor under water is CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentration. The plant needs enough amount of CO<sub>2<\/sub> to carry on photosynthesis. In an ideal water body, if a plant can survive, then algae/bacteria can thrive, which would together produce lots of CO<sub>2<\/sub> (by respiration) which would dissolve in water.

The skin around it puckers.  It's mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (the \"fight-or-flight\" aspect of the system).  This is how animals' fur stands up when afraid or upset (think of a scared cat).<\/p>\n\n<p>It's called the pilomotor reflex.  It also helps them keep warm (fur insulates) - so it happens when we're cold too.  But since we have so few hairs, it's not very useful to us.

Some hypothetical examples:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>longer legs may help run faster but past a certain point will increase the risk of injury, decreasing survival;<\/li>\n<li>lower body-weight may increase top speed but past a certain point will decrease starvation tolerance;<\/li>\n<li>more muscle may help acceleration but increase energy    requirements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All changes have costs and benefits. In situations where the outcome of an event is simply \"success/failure\", there is therefore an evolutionary incentive to evolve to be <em>just good enough<\/em>. Once you are good enough getting better only increases the cost (I am oversimplifying this a bit).<\/p>\n\n<p>Change in an extrinsic driver will change the balance of cost and benefit, shifting evolutionary pressure. For example, when predators are absent (island populations) birds sometimes become flightless, because one benefit of flight (escape from predators) no longer applies.<\/p>\n\n<p>The interesting bit happens when the \"extrinsic driver\" is another living thing that is also capable of evolving. In this case you suddenly get an evolutionary arms race where each side is constantly subject to a selective pressure to be slightly better than the other, which is a moving target. You therefore get an arms race situation (or the extinction of one or the other side). The Red Queen hypothesis is named after a quote by the Red Queen in \"Alice through the looking glass\" (Carroll, 1871):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in\n  the same place.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Using the example of a lion and a gazelle: lions run fast enough to catch and eat the slowest gazelles. The remaining gazelles are on average faster, for whatever reason(s). Some of those reasons will be heritable and the next generation of gazelles will be faster. The slowest lions will starve, and some of the reasons for the remaining lions being faster will be heritable so the next generation will be a bit faster, and then you're back where you started. Rinse ad repeat.<\/p>\n\n<p>Predation obviously operates on a much faster timescale than selection, so this doesn't always occur (putting a fox in a chicken coop won't evolve fast chickens).<\/p>\n\n<p>Coevolutionary \"arms races\" can be seen in predator-prey interactions, mimicry and much more (including for example the evolution of sex, but that's off-topic for this answer).<\/p>\n","answer_id":45350,"question_id":45342,"up_vote_count":17},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":32,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":1,"post_id":45352,"edited":false,"creation_date":1461063884,"comment_id":79395,"body":"Good answer, but for readability I would restructure it and put the arms race/RQH parts at the top, since those issues are most targetted to this particular question.

A lot of this is covered <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35532/why-do-some-bad-traits-evolve-and-good-ones-dont?lq=1\">elsewhere<\/a> on this site (including the effects of the other mechanisms of evolution), but little specific reference is made to <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15514/what-prevents-predator-overpopulation/15516#15516\">predator-prey<\/a> co-evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Adaptation and genetic variance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5007/how-is-evolution-possible-in-contemporary-humans/5058#5058\">mechanisms of evolution<\/a> is selection, and adaptation occurs when species evolve as a response to selection. For a response to selection to occur there <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2944/genetic-diversity-and-adaptation/44286#44286\">must be genetic variation within the trait<\/a>, such that the genes an individual carries affect the individuals fitness. For example, there may some genes which give the carrier better muscle structure for fast running, and this increases survival which, in turn, increases reproductive output. The importance of genetic variation is often overlooked, but is highlighted by the <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16806/how-to-interpret-the-breeders-equation\">breeders equation<\/a>. Genetic variance can arise by novel mutations, or can exist as standing genetic variance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Selection on covarying traits<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Selection is seldom, if ever, a univariate process. That means fitness is not determined by a single characteristic, so fitness in a prey species may be determined by the speed at which it can run, but also its metabolic rate, stamina, ability to acquire nutrients, the way it provisions nutrients for growth and repair etc.. Genetic covariance between traits (induced by linkage or pleiotropy) can impact the response to selection, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41813/why-even-if-all-requirements-for-natural-selection-are-met-it-may-not-happen/41843#41843\">because any selection acting on a covarying trait can cause affect the adaptation occurring in the focal trait<\/a> (strengthening, weakening, neutralising, or even reversing the direction of response). Therefore, if running speed covaries with other traits it may be difficult for selection to increase running speed. Think about athletes, I doubt Usain Bolt could run 10,000 metres as fast as Mo Farah and vice versa, because there is a trade-off between speed and stamina.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Adaptation in other species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>If<\/em> selection did cause speed to increase in the prey species then that would strengthen selection for increased speed in the predator. This is called an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_arms_race\">evolutionary arms race<\/a>, where the adaptive the evolution of two species interacts causing adaptation and counter-adaptation. For example, genes which allow faster running might spread through a population of gazelles (prey) because carriers are more likely to outrun the lion (<a href=\"http://usconversation.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/funny-bear-chasing-fat-people.jpg\">or the other gazelles<\/a>), but this will increase selection on lions (predator) to increase speed (or adopt other strategies) which will spread genes to make the lions faster (use other strategies); the result being adaptation and counter-adaptation between the gazelle and lion populations. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OYU7K.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OYU7K.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>There is a little series here about Butch Brodie and <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/biowarfare_01\">his studies of coevolutionary arms races<\/a> between garter snakes and toxic newts. It would be good to read on the <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~curtweb/Research/Red_Queen%20hyp.html\">Red Queen Hypothesis<\/a>, which describes how species, under interaction with other species, must continue to evolve just to prevent extinction. Also worth noting that prey species often have more than one predator species (and predator species often have more than one prey); interaction and coevolutionary networks are complex. What may be adaptive in some interactions may also be maladaptive for other interactions (see <em>specialist<\/em> and <em>generalist<\/em>, and <em>selection on covarying traits<\/em>).<\/p>\n","answer_id":45352,"question_id":45342,"up_vote_count":32,"last_edit_date":1461155774}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45342/why-havent-prey-evolved-the-ability-to-always-outrun-their-predators","last_activity_date":1461190951,"creation_date":1461031916,"answer_count":5,"title":"Why haven't prey evolved the ability to always outrun their predators?","body":"<p>I can understand why some prey can't outrun a recently evolved species.
