I present three pieces of evidence and some interpretations. In general, my feeling after reading about this is that the assumption of equilibrium is ingrained in mathematical models for convenience and <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/fitness-landscapes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">historic reasons<\/a> not because there is solid evidence for it. (I expand more on this in <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/empirical-epistasis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Evidence against: vestigial features and macroevolutionary change<\/h3>\n\n<p>From a genome-wide perspective, it seems that equilibrium is at odds with the intuition of naturalists. Consider for example vestigial features of your own body like your appendix, goose bumps, tonsils, wisdom teeth, third eyelid, or the second joint in the middle of your foot made immobile by a tightened ligament (see video below). Wouldn't it be more efficient (and thus produce marginally higher fitness) if you didn't spend the energy to construct these features? Of course, this naturalist argument is not convincing since we don\u2019t know if there are any small mutations that could remove these vestigial features from our development, I could just be describing a different local optimum that lays on the other side of a fitness valley from my current vertex.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other tempting naturalist example of macroevolutionary changes like speciation is also not convincing for static fitness landscapes. The usual retort is that on these timescales the environment is not constant and depends on the organisms through mechanisms like niche-construction or frequency-dependence. This defense of local equilibria is actually a central part of the punctuated equilibrium theory of evolution; the environment changes (either through an external effect like meteor or internal effect like migration or niche-construction) and the wild-type becomes not locally optimal, but adaptation quickly carries the species to a new nearby local optimum where it remains for a long period of time until the next environmental change. Naturalistic observations are insufficient to settle this question, so we need to turn to experiments.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Evidence for: affinity maturation<\/h3>\n\n<p>The length of evolutionary process leading to <a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/micro-macro-evolution/#affinity\" rel=\"nofollow\">affinity maturation<\/a> is very short, typically a local equilibrium is found after only 6-8 nucleotide changes in CDR (Crews et al., 1981; Tonegawa, 1983; Clark et al., 1985), so you need only a few point mutations to quickly develop a drastically better tuned antibody -- an adaptive process that happens on the order of days. There are two reservations to keep in mind: <\/p>\n\n<p>First, the adapted B-cells were not experimentally isolated and all of their point-mutations were not checked to guarantee that a fitness peak was reached. In both theoretical and experimental treatments of evolution, it is known that fitness increases tend to show a pattern of geometrically diminishing returns (Lenski &amp; Travisano 1994; Orr, 1998; Cooper &amp; Lenski, 2000) which means that after a few generations the fitness change will be so small that the fixation time in the large population of B-cells will be longer than the presence of the pathogen causing the immune response. We might not be seeing more steps because the next steps might have a fitness increase too small to fixate before the environment (and thus, fitness landscape) changes again. <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, as can be seen from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation-Induced_(Cytidine)_Deaminase\" rel=\"nofollow\">AID protein<\/a> (and other mechanisms) increasing the rate of mutation by a factor of $10^6$ along the gene encoding antibody proteins, this is a fitness landscape that has been shaped by previous evolution of the human immune system to find fit mutants as quickly as possible. This biases the phenomenon towards landscapes where local maxima would be easier to find than usual, and thus makes it not a good candidate for considering evolution under more typical conditions.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Evidence against: long-term evolution experiment<\/h3>\n\n<p>A more typical setting might be the evolution of <i>E. coli<\/i> in a static fitness landscape. Here, biologists have run <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">long-term experiments<\/a> tracking a population for <a href=\"http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/celebrate50K.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 50,000 generations<\/a> (Lenski &amp; Travisano 1994; Cooper &amp; Lenski, 2000; Blount et al. 2012) and continue to still find adaptations and marginal increases in fitness. This suggests that a local optimum is not quickly found, even though the environment is static. However, it is difficult to estimate the number of adaptive mutations that fixed in this population, and Lenski (2003) estimated that as few as 100 adaptive point-mutations fixated in the first 20,000 generations. It is also hard to argue that the population doesn't traverse small fitness valleys between measurements, which could be used to suggest that the colony is hopping from one easy-to-find local equilibrium to the next.<\/p>\n\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<p>Blount, Z.

A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna_binding_domain\">DNA-binding domain<\/a> is a protein structure that has a high affinity for DNA, and so binds to it when the two molecules are in the same vicinity. An example is a type of protein called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor\">transcription factor<\/a>, which binds to DNA in the nucleus of the cell (in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotes\">Eukaryotes<\/a>, bacteria and Archaea don't have nuclei - the DNA just floats free) and causes changes in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28genetics%29\">transcription<\/a> of genes. The following image from <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3aTranscription_Factors.svg\">WikiMedia<\/a> shows how transcription factors work in general.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JUfh3.png\" alt=\"transcription factors\"><\/p>\n\n<p>\"DNA coiling\" is a very generic term that describes many different things. The basic structure of DNA itself is a coil, with two sugar chains (the <em>deoxyribose<\/em> in DeoxyriboNucleic Acid or DNA) coiling around each other, and attached by nucleic acid bases. In the eukaryotic cell, individual strands of DNA are associated with structural proteins to create <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin\">chromatin<\/a>, which is what makes up chromosomes in the nucleus of each cell. In the first stage, naked DNA is wrapped or coiled around structural proteins called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone\">histones<\/a> into a structure called a nucleosome. These then stack into a \"solenoid\" or fiber structure, which makes up so-called \"relaxed\" chromatin - regions of the genome where active transcription is taking place. If a part of a chromosome has been marked as inactive, or during certain steps in the cell cycle when one cell splits into two (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis\">mitosis<\/a>), the fibers further coil into condensed chromatin, forming the typical structure many people associate with chromosomes. This image, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aDNA_to_Chromatin_Formation.jpg\">Wikipedia<\/a>, visualizes each step in the process.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IiYor.jpg\" alt=\"chromatin structure\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The word \"motif\" can sometimes mean the same thing as domain - for example, someone might refer to a \"DNA-binding motif\" in a protein. However, a motif is typically smaller than a domain, can occur in DNA, RNA, and proteins, and has to do with the specific sequence. A \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif\">structural motif<\/a>\" in a protein is something like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic-helix-loop-helix\">helix-loop-helix<\/a> or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_hairpin\">beta-hairpin turn<\/a> that can appear in multiple different kinds of protein domains, and doesn't necessarily have the same exact function in those different domains, but typically has a fairly conserved sequence that is very similar. As an example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger\">zinc finger<\/a> motif is found in protein domains that bind DNA, RNA, and other proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of this terminology can be very confusing at first, but if you stick with it it'll get easier over time.

In all countries at any time point, the male to female ratio was always higher than one. In some countries (Mexico and a few northern eastern European countries) the male proportion has been decreasing over the 1950-1994 period, whereas in southern Europe and Australia it has been increasing.

He cites several studies that show problems like this one, but I do not have the knowledge to refute it properly. Whats the problem with the following: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One problem is that population genetics shows us evolution destroys functional sequences much faster than it creates them in any large-genome animal with low reproductive rates, because deleterious mutations arrive faster than selection can remove them.  This would include just about all mammals, reptiles, and birds--any of our would-be ancestors over the last 300m years.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Specifically, humans get <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/03/estimating-human-mutation-rate-direct.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">60<\/a> to <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/03/estimating-human-mutation-rate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">160<\/a> mutations per generation, <a href=\"http://justpaste.it/2dlm\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-20+%<\/a> of our genome is sensitive to substitution, and this gives us 6-32 deleterious mutations per offspring (most slight).  Even with the low estimate of 6, every child is less fit than their parents and natural (or even artificial) selection can only choose the least degenerate each generation.  For every generation where a mutation can be selected, random mutations destroy 5-32+ previously selected.  Beneficial mutations like lactose tolerance (a jammed switch) take 1000s of years to appear and fixate.  <\/p>\n  \n  <p>If you know the genome size, mutation rate, and reproductive rate, you can calculate at what rate deleterious mutations arrive faster than they can be removed:<\/p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>\"It has been estimated that there are as many as 100 new mutations in the genome of each individual human. If even a small fraction of these mutations are deleterious and removed by selection, it is difficult to explain how human populations could have survived. If the effects of mutations act in a multiplicative manner, the proportion of individuals that become selectively eliminated from the population (proportion of `genetic deaths') is 1-e^-U, where U is the deleterious mutation rate per diploid, so a high rate of deleterious mutation (U>>1) is paradoxical in a species with a low reproductive rate.\" <a href=\"http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/CSE/members/aeyrewalker/pdfs/EWNature99.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">High genomic deleterious mutation rates in hominids<\/a>, (Nature, 1999)<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n  \n  <p>They worry about a deleterious rate of U much greater than 1 as being prohibitively high and we're talking about it being 6-32+, since we now know the functional genome is much larger than we thought it was in 1999.  Taking their Poisson probability distribution and using U=6, that means 1-e^-6 = 99.752% of the population will have to be selected away each generation for one lucky enough to have no deleterious mutations.  For two to survive and maintain constant population size that would require on average 806 offspring per female--impossible for most mammals, birds, and reptiles.

Although it is not difficult to imagine how the trigeminal nerve could be stimulated by a foreign body touching the cornea, it seems that several theories exist on how light can stimulate it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The great part of the information that I could find at this regard are about a similar reflex, called the  the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_sneeze_reflex\" rel=\"nofollow\">photic sneeze reflex<\/a> or or ACHOO (Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophtalmologic Outburst) syndrome. This occurs in ~1/4 of the population, and consists of sneezing when looking at the Sun.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case, several theories have been proposed, that essentially boil down to the fact that some other nerve (e.g. the optic nerve) stimulates the trigeminal after having being itself stimulated by bright light.<\/p>\n\n<p>From: \"General anaesthesia and the photosternutatory reflex\" - Yarrow - <em>Anaesthesia<\/em>. <strong>2003<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The physiology underlying the photosternutatory reflex remains unclear and several mechanisms have been proposed. The theory of optic-trigeminal summation holds that the optic and trigeminal nerves are intimately linked in the midbrain. Bright light stimulates the optic nerve, causing photophobia and pain via the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Conversely, nasal irritation can lead to blinking and lacrimation. It is suggested that intense stimulation of the optic nerve could cause sneezing if the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve was stimulated as well as the ophthalmic branch. The theory of parasympathetic generalisation invokes co-activation by one stimulus of neighbouring parasympathetic branches. Light falling on the retina stimulates pupillary constriction (via the third cranial nerve) and lacrimation\n  (via the seventh). A stimulus of sufficient intensity could generate\n  enough parasympathetic activity to cause nasal congestion and secretions, and\n  stimulate sneezing by an effect on the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.\n  The theory of parasympathetic hypersensitivity suggests that individuals\n  with photic sneezing may have a more active or sensitive parasympathetic system,\n  leading to hypersensitive nasal mucosa.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Although what you describe does not involve sneezing I think we can assume the same, or a similar afferent pathway is activated also in that case.<\/p>\n\n<p>Recent works also found an activation of visual regions of the cortex in response to this stimulus.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the conclusions of:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009208\" rel=\"nofollow\">When the Sun Prickles Your Nose: An EEG Study Identifying Neural Bases of Photic Sneezing<\/a> - Langer et al. - <em>PLoS One<\/em>, <strong>2010<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We propose that the photic sneeze phenomenon might be the consequence of higher sensitivity to visual stimuli in the visual cortex and of co-activation of somatosensory areas.

If both the ribosome and the mRNA are freely floating and not attached to anything else (as in <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/1742/239\">jp89's answer<\/a>), the relative amount of movement should depend on their relative masses.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Actually, it also depends on how much drag each of them experiences with respect to the surrounding liquid medium, but since I have no idea how much that is, and since it's probably highly conformation-dependent anyway, I'm going to just ignore that and just assume that the drag is also more or less proportional to mass, at least to first order.)<\/p>\n\n<p>As it happens, a quick Google search and some back of the envelope calculation suggests that the mass of a ribosome and the average mass of an mRNA are both around a megadalton.

Genes can also be silenced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone#Structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">histone modification<\/a>, binding a gene to histones reduces its activity, ie it produces less product.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genomic imprinting was <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/145/3628/130.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">first described in Mealy Bugs<\/a> (or at least this is one of the first described) which silence half of their genome in males. Whilst females are fully diploid, the male is also diploid but one half of the genome is silenced, making them effectively haploid. This is done by turning one half of the genome <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin\" rel=\"nofollow\">heterochromatic<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong><\/em>\"If I say that \"this\" allele is maternally imprinted does it mean that\n  the allele of the gene is passed only by the mother?

In this case, when a gene is imprinted, the gene is silenced. An example is <em>Igf2<\/em> in mice described in the below diagram which is <a href=\"http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-M/molecular_imprinting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">maternal imprinting (ie the mothers allele is silenced)<\/a>. When the mother has a mutant allele and the father a normal allele and normal offspring is produced. When the male passes on the <em>Igf2<\/em> mutant the offspring is mutant because the mother's normal copy was imprinted.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zpHB1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Igf2 gene can be seen in the above diagram. This is the one of the\n  first evidences of genomic imprinting discovered. In the first part of\n  the diagram a mutant gene trying to make the mouse offspring dwarf is\n  passed from the mother. It can be seen that the mouse is not dwarf\n  because the allele for size in this mouse is an imprinted. The\n  maternal allele is not expressed, so the dwarf trait is not expressed\n  in the offspring, only the normal size trait from the father is. In\n  the second part of the diagram the father passes on the mutant gene\n  and therefore all the offspring will be dwarf because the size trait\n  is completely dependent on the paternal allele, which in this case is\n  dwarf. - <a href=\"http://sharonap-cellrepro-p3.wikispaces.com/Creating+Variation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creating Variation<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sharonap-cellrepro-p3.wikispaces.com/Creating+Variation\" rel=\"nofollow\">The page<\/a> this diagram and quote comes from also has a good section on genomic imprinting.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9761,"question_id":9689,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1376469415}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9689/what-is-genomic-imprinting","last_activity_date":1376469415,"creation_date":1375980209,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is genomic imprinting?","body":"<p>What is a  genomic imprint?

To find if it is associated with tongue rolling, you would count the number of AA, AG, and GG individuals (alternatively you could sum the number of A and G alleles) in the group that can roll their tongue and compare those numbers to the group that cannot.

In general, if in the course of an animal's natural feeding process it picks up a little dirt, it has evolved to cope with that.  Animal's behaviors and guts have evolved to fit their food source and lifestyle.  For a behavioral example, seals will eat rough rocks to help breakdown bones (and barf them up when they get too smooth).  Guts have evolved symbiotic relationships with microbes that are specifically adapted to the food source, termites have microbes to help them break down wood, whereas we don't have the microbe population to pull that off.  Interesting side note: it was <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/news.2010.169.html\">found<\/a> that one of the gut microbes in some Japanese people has gotten a horizontally transferred gene from a bacteria that lives on seaweed, probably helping them break down seaweed.<\/p>\n\n<p>There could be a problem when the body is challenged with dirt that contains uncommon substances that the body isn't adapted to.

As a result, proponents of this hypothesis think that our bodies are adapted to challenges by microbes and parasites, and depriving our bodies of that exposure when we are young totally screws up the development of our immune systems.  This would explain why we see a huge increase in allergies and autoimmune diseases in the developed world, our immune systems are totally miscalibrated, and freak out over harmless things like pollen (allergies), or worse, attack self-antigens (anti-insulin antibodies in type I diabetes).

This 'army' is so vast in diversity that it covers virtually every molecule that occurs in the world - including those of the own body.<\/li>\n<li>This method requires the elimination of those randomly created cells which recognise the body's own substances. The mechanism of elimination is extremely beautiful and makes great use of the way genetics work: Because every cell contains ALL genetic information for your body (except that in almost all cell types the vast majority of it isn't being used most of the time), it is possible to have a few cells which will simply randomly produce bits that belong to a completely different part of the body. This way, everything that belongs into the body will be present where these specialised cells live - which is the bone marrow and the thymus. Thanks to them, it is possible to test every single B and T cell against everything that occurs in the body - and kill them if it turns out they recognise something.<\/li>\n<li>This is how you end up with an army that only reacts to things which are not part of the body.<\/li>\n<li>In other words, an individual cell doesn't distinguish foreign from body, it simply doesn't react to anything aside from its specific target - which should be foreign if the earlier selection mechanism worked.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Aside from this, the main method by which B and T cells determine whether to activate or not is <strong>context<\/strong>, which means two things:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>B and T cells require co-stimulation to activate - T cells from the so-called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and B cells from T cells.<\/li>\n<li>In order to be activated, adaptive immune cells (T cells in particular) depend on the levels of certain inflammatory messengers (known as cytokines) in their environment. In other words, the presence of inflammation is a signal to immune cells that in this location where they currently are, abnormal processes are happening and there may be a need for them to take action. As the reasonable response, they will activate or enter a state ready for activation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Both APCs and inflammation are mainly provided by parts of the innate immune system, adding another safety barrier with more recognition mechanisms to tell self from non-self.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9696,"question_id":9339,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9339/cell-identification-by-body-cells","last_activity_date":1376005069,"creation_date":1374246845,"answer_count":3,"title":"Cell identification by Body Cells","body":"<p>How do the B-cells and T-cells recognize or distinguish a body cell from a foreign particle?<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect something to do with this causes Auto Immune Disorders. <\/p>\n","question_id":9339,"tags":["immunology","autoimmune"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":74,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7974275b33c1c13d775152e812b35776?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":558,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/558/kirby","reputation":619,"display_name":"Kirby","accept_rate":52},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1375440688/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":4139,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4139/johntreml","reputation":536,"display_name":"johntreml"},"score":0,"post_id":3530,"edited":false,"creation_date":1375986548,"comment_id":12749,"body":"(This should be a comment, but my reputation precludes me from doing that) I just wanted to chime in and say that it looks to me that the last three are just Red Herrings that are supposed to make you think a bit."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef6c1e9a540c28587fe777f9bcf907af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1231/mcm","reputation":7783,"display_name":"MCM"},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1375991534,"creation_date":1347512167,"body":"<h2>Red blood cell<\/h2>\n\n<p>Will probably not.

This is a prediction of the biologist Robert Trivers, working with Bill Hamilton in the late '60s, known also as the 'selfish gene'.  In fact the reason the selfish gene theory was so successful was that selfish genes - individual genes which propagated to offspring more often than 50% of the time. The Dawkins book 'The Selfish Gene' discusses this whole idea and its ramifications in great detail. <\/p>\n\n<p>So at different times in evolutionary history, its hard to imagine that meiosis was completely 'fair' (50/50% change of any segment of DNA being chosen).

The most famous of these experiments was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prisoner's dilemma<\/a> competition where all comers have been invited to submit computer programs which can either betray or cooperate.

Say what you will about the income tax as a system!  there is variance over time as to how 'fair' a system can be. <\/p>\n\n<p>Dawkins has even said he sometimes thinks he should have titled the 'selfish gene' something else instead: '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_Guys_Finish_First\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nice Guys Finish First<\/a>'.

It got a lot of attention decades ago when James McConnell did a number of experiments where he conditioned planarian flatworms to respond to certain stimuli, ground them up, fed them to worms that hadn't gone through the conditioning.  He claimed to have observed that the worms fed conditioned worms learned to respond to the stimuli faster.  This supported the idea that memories were just RNA or proteins, and thus survived the grinding up process.  His results were not readily reproducible, and so the idea fell out of favor.<\/p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of studies at this point that have been able to look at the firing of individual neurons and shown that there are unique patterns that respond to different stimuli, for example: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966627\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966627<\/a>  So I think it is pretty well established that there are certain connections between neurons that are critical, sometimes even individual neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p>That doesn't necessarily rule out that there are unique RNA or proteins in those specific neurons, and they are whats actually storing the memory.  I'm not a neuroscientist, but I think the biggest argument against such a storage system is simply the speed with which you can recognize something.  When you see a face you know you nearly instantly recognize the person, and have a flood of memories about that person.  If the memories were somehow stored in RNA or protein structures, I think it would take much longer to somehow \"read-out\" that data from the molecular structure.  The only thing that really works that fast are the action potentials in neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p>An interesting comparison might be made to the system in our bodies that DOES have molecular-based memory, the immune system.  When you get sick with a cold you've never been sick with, your immune system doesn't immediately recognize the antigens that come from that virus.  Through the process of somatic hypermutation, your body produces B- and T-cells that have protein receptors that recognize the viruses and the cells infected by the viruses and go and kill them.  A small subset of the T and B cells that have the molecular recognition of that cold become 'memory' cells.  These memory cells that go into a quiescent phase, waiting around until the next time that cold infects you.  But that time they 'remember' it immediately, and you dont get nearly as sick, if at all, because the genes for those recognition proteins are stored in the memory cells.  The activation of immunological memory cells takes a long time as compared to remembering a face, or some other normal memory function, so such a molecular system couldn't be responsible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9661,"question_id":9656,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1375847879}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9656/molecules-and-human-memory","last_activity_date":1375884015,"creation_date":1375815262,"answer_count":1,"title":"Molecules and human memory","body":"<p>Has it been demonstrated that the memory of human brain is just connections between neurons, not \"long\" molecules such as RNA or proteins?<\/p>\n","question_id":9656,"tags":["biochemistry","neuroscience","brain","memory"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":182,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1375884015},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/701093003/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":4188,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4188/rasmus-larsen","reputation":116,"display_name":"Rasmus Larsen"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":9665,"edited":false,"creation_date":1375872793,"comment_id":12712,"body":"Some sort of algae?

This may seem paradoxical, but for most groups of sessile macrofauna (cnidarians, tunicates, bryozoans, brachiopods, some molluscs, and so on), the limiting resource in the ocean is space, and any solid or semisolid surface is a good surface to live on, so <em>at least<\/em> along the margins of the solar plates, we should expect to see enormous amounts of macrofauna, in the same way as we see lots of it on the keels of ships, on jetties, oilrigs, and all other man-made structures in the sea.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would expect that once such a sessile community is established, it would be beneficial to other organisms as well.

The next generation sequencing methods used for the neanderthal genome just give you DNA sequences, not what epigenetic modifications are present on that DNA.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genomic imprinting<\/a> in mammals is very important, and presents problems even in normal cloning efforts where genomes are taken wholesale from live animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not to mention that 1% of the current genome is contaminated with human DNA (not meant as a criticism, its amazing what they have been able to do with a toe bone if this work stands up to peer review).<\/p>\n\n<p>And none of this takes into account the ethical problems associated with this.

By making your days lighter and your nights\n  darker, you can improve both the quality of your sleep and the amount\n  of time it takes you to fall asleep.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and recommend all kind of protection against the light, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dark Nights: Make your nights as dark as possible.

It happens over time, so if you had a solution of BT without any bacteria or spores and left it at room temperature, after some (very long) time the toxin would be destroyed. By adding heat (or acid) you accelerate the denaturation, but it still is a statistical phenomenon. If at a certain temperature half of toxin particles are destroyed within a second, it means that within a minute one in $2^{60}$ will be left. But 1 in $2^{60}$ is not zero. If you keep the temperature for two minutes, one toxin particle in $2^{120}$ will be left. You can never be 100% sure all toxin was destroyed.<\/p>\n\n<p>This also means, that there is no one set \"minimum time and minimum temperature\". The higher the temperature, the lower the time needed. You can keep food at room temperature for a very long time and the toxin will be destroyed (though I doubt that the food itself will survive that kind of time).<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, one molecule of toxin will not kill you. Think about BT injections as anti-wrinkle therapy. A small amount of toxin in injected, it paralyses small facial muscles and the face looks smoother, younger. The effect wears off, so you have to repeat the injection every now and then. In order to make food safe to eat, you don't have to destroy all BT molecules.

Since the top portion of the fruit is in fact the end of the primary stem, this region contains the apical meristem, a collection of stem cells that are apparently is sufficient to give rise to a mature organism. Pineapple development has apparently been a topic of constant research for nearly a century (due to its economic importance), so there are quite a number of papers that can provide much more detail, but many of these are not freely available.<\/p>\n\n<p>In nature the primary means of pineapple propagation is the formations of lateral shoots, the growth of which consequently are accelerated by influoresence of the main shoot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the actual way the plant grows is not quite as simple to answer, as plant development is often as complicated as animal development, but in general it is a function of cell division and elongation. In the root apical meristem, there is a region known as the quiescent centre which contains the actual root stem cells. Directly behind the quiescent centre is a region known as the merismatic zone, which features extensive cell division, and directly behind that is the elongation region where the cells grow, effectively pushing the root tip through the soil. In the region behind the elongation region, the maturation zone where the cells have reached full length, cells begin to form more rigid cell walls and differentiate into the different tissues of the root.<\/p>\n\n<p>The shoot apical meristem is dome-shaped, the top of the dome is known as the central zone and is analogous to the quiescent centre of the root apical meristem, the sides of the dome are the peripheral zone, a region of rapidly dividing cells that give rise to the leaves, and the central region of the dome is the rib zone that gives rise to the stem structures. Elongation, differentiation, and maturation also occur below the meristem region, but involve the additional complexities of leaf organogenesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>There should be considerable additional information on plant development online.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9607,"question_id":8880,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1375501999}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8880/how-do-pineapples-and-lemongrass-grow","last_activity_date":1375501999,"creation_date":1371831411,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do pineapples and lemongrass grow?","body":"<p>You can't plant the leaves, you can't plant the fruit, but, if you plant the part where leaves and fruit <em>meet<\/em> you will grow a whole pineapple plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>The part of the pineapple where the leaves meet the stem is the point from which the whole plant <em>seems<\/em> to form.

Tests have been done with rats to try and create stronger and smarter rats, and tests have been done on countless other animals to try to develop immunity to dementia and Alzheimers. In the agricultural industries of the world, new types of corn, tomatoes, rice, and other types of crops are engineered on a daily basis, and new versions of these plants are made very commonly. The problem, however, is that a vast quantity of these plants are rejected from being planted. Some plants that are engineered either taste too bad, or they are less efficient than the plant at which they were modifying. As far as inventing a new species, you have to be more specific as to what you are asking. If science creates a new animal from another animal, it is likely of the same family and genus, like breeding a dog from another dog. Creating another type of mammal or reptile or bacteria that isn't part of a specific genus would be a breakthrough, as I am sure that all types of cloning and scientific pairing have been done to the same general Genus and Species... I am assuming, however, that it will be possible to engineer lifeforms at the molecular level by the next 50 to 100 years, as science and technology is getting more and more advanced. So, by the next few centuries, it would only seem logical to assume that new species would be created. However, the practice of creating new species, or even operating a laboratory/facility that deals with the concept, is illegal in a large number of countries, and has several guidelines in others. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>I am only 13, so if any of this information is to be used anywhere else, I would advise not to cite me as a credible source.

Air isn't nearly as dense as water, so a streamlined form won't show a major benefit unless the organism is traveling very, very quickly. This is why you see it in birds; raptors can travel over 100mph while diving, and at those speeds small changes in drag can mean the difference between dinner and starving.

You don't <em>need<\/em> to run fast when you can climb a tree and simply get away from any predators on the ground. After we came down from the trees permanently, our larger brains allowed us to use tools to fend off predators - which, again, is much simpler than evolving an aerodynamic form that won't make a difference until you're running at the speed of a car.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in lieu of becoming a land-shark, we have hands that can use keyboards and minds that can invent the keyboard. Unfortunately, while the gains are many, the costs do include both a very long period of time where humans are helpless without parents, and an absolutely terrible form of locomotion with our upright stance on forward-pointing knees.

B is the number of others involved, and r is the relationship value to the actor in terms of genetic similarity.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if you and two full-siblings (who each share on-average 50% of your genome) and a bus comes straight at the group, and you have the capability to push them out of the way while dying yourself, kin selection suggests you shouldn't because the genetic cost is equivalent. You eliminate yourself from the gene pool, and save the equivalent of yourself for future generations (2 x 1/2 = 1). <\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you and <strong>three<\/strong> siblings were in the situation, then it's evolutionarily advantageous to be altruistic. You would die (a cost of 1), but you would save the equivalent of 1.5x your genome (3 x 1/2 = 1.5) to pass on to future generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, communal and social behaviors like those of ants basically boil down to: Everybody is so closely related that spending resources to help your kin is essentially spending resources to ensure the majority of your genome survives (which is the big point of evolution, after all).<\/p>\n\n<p>Wilson's argument, what I can glean from the small brief of the study and the article, is that you don't need the relatedness equation to explain altruistic behavior in social situations (basically the row is he's saying the currently accepted theory is wrong). All you need to start with is a genetic mutation somewhere along the line that <strong>causes the offspring to stick close to home.<\/strong> Once you have a few generations that don't leave the nest, you start to develop social behavior that results in altruism because you've gone from selfish individuals to a group setting.<\/p>\n\n<p>The article and Wilson don't give any more insight other than altruism apparently develops spontaneously from the formation of groups. Simply being social is the explanation for why some individuals will give resources to others to ensure the success of the others. <\/p>\n\n<p>Whether or not Wilson is correct isn't really discussed.

F. Skinner conducted some fairly famous experiments with pigeons, where he put hungry pigeons in cages, and randomly administered the food. The pigeons associated the foods arrival with whatever they happened to be doing at the time (be it looking to the right, or bobbing their heads). They would then keep trying this until more food came out (randomly), and the pigeons 'superstition' was confirmed. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Superstition_in_the_pigeon\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I realize this is not concrete, but it seems to me that they are not 'communicating' as such, they are simply repeating what has worked before. It is your anthropomorphication that has meant this seems like deliberate communication in my opinion.

We can therefore interpret the body language of an animal (in this case, dog), if we are familiar (you do not even have to have owned a dog necessarily) with the kinds of postures adopted. So the dog does not have to consciously 'communicate' for us to interpret their emotional state (happy/sad/angry/...).<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of human-pet communication then, there seems to be more emphasis on the human interpretation of the natural postures adopted by animals, than the animals themselves. Pets may behave very differently to animals in the wild, but it comes back to what the specific human is used to. If you have had a lot of contact with pet dogs you are in a better position to associate the current behaviour of a pet dog with the correct emotional state. No doubt the animal with subconsciously adjust their behaviour to achieve the 'correct' human interpretation, and thus get fed, or whatever. <\/p>\n","answer_id":2464,"question_id":2463,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1339677640}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2463/is-there-such-thing-as-animal-non-verbal-body-language","last_activity_date":1375452740,"creation_date":1338557808,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there such thing as Animal non-verbal body language?","body":"<p>Have there been any studies done on the animal use of their bodies to signal, communicate or express their emotions, particularly to members of other species (ex: humans)?<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been observing a very intelligent indoor-outdoor cat who has been doing the same sideways stretching posture every day he met me.

Bonobos, on the other hand, lead very peaceful lives, and are female-dominated, using sexual contact as a manner of communication to reduce tension within and between groups. Orangutans are largely solitary animals, with heavy parental investment (7 years, longest among non-human primates), wherein the mother lives separately with her child during the early years of development. Among the lesser apes, gibbons and siamangs are also highly territorial and pair-bonded, though notably, <a href=\"http://www.aseanbiodiversity.info/Abstract/53005525.pdf\">polyandrous siamang groups<\/a> have been shown to display higher degrees of cooperation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though Anarchism varies greatly between different definitions, the most popular form of contemporary Anarchism values non-hierarchical organization, centered around mutual aid, rather than the kind of isolated individualism that you seem to associate with the term. By this definition, bonobos would be more \"Anarchist\" than chimpanzees. By your definition, orangutans might be the most \"Anarchist.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Your definition of \"Communism\" is closer to the contemporary definition of Anarchism above, due mainly to the historical trajectory of Communism, which in practice, did not work out so well, leaving contemporary utopian thinkers largely in the Anarchist camp. By your definition of \"Communism,\" bonobos may be the most \"Communist\"; however, if you mean the state-based gulag Communism of popular culture (ie portrayals of the Soviet Union), then you might say that chimps were more Communist. This is because individual chimps sacrifice individual goal attainment for group ends under the coercion of the alpha male chimp. Of course, some people may call that Fascism.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may want to take a look at primatologist Franz De Waal's research on bonobos vs. chimpanzees. As a pacifist, he has a bit of an agenda, in terms of trying to prove that female-dominated bonobo \"societies\" are inherently more cooperative and less hierarchical. Another primatologist that agrees with this view is Harvard primatologist Richard Wrangham, who looks at hierarchical organization and violent behaviors in chimpanzees.<\/p>\n\n<p>Robert Sapolsky's <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387823/\">research on baboons<\/a> may also be of interest to you. He found a clan of baboons, in which all the alpha males had died from tuberculosis due to exposure to an infected meat found in a neighboring human village. He noted, then, that the remaining baboons lived much more peaceably and cooperatively than other observed clans, and furthermore, that this clan retained its \"culture\" and passed on its more cooperative ways of behaving to new members in the clan, therefore demonstrating that perhaps baboons (and other primates) are capable of having and passing on \"culture.\" - Perhaps a more \"Anarchist\" culture than nature normally prescribes.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, as a caveat, I must say: it is tenuous to make direct associations between ape behavior and human societies. Human culture, social intelligence, and symbolic reasoning facilitate human political systems. Though Sapolsky's work suggests primates may also be capable of some form of \"culture,\" biological descriptions of ape social organization is insufficient to explain human behavior.<\/p>\n","answer_id":7598,"question_id":7589,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1363827373}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7589/are-ape-communities-more-anarchist-or-communist-in-structure","last_activity_date":1375452708,"creation_date":1363779947,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are ape communities more \"anarchist\" or \"communist\" in structure?","body":"<p>I am using these terms because we can imagine them quite good, I guess ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>By \"anarchist\" I mean that the ape wants to live without the rule of others apes(same biological race or other) and he pursue his own goals (replication, getting food etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>By \"communist\" I mean working together in groups because of the \"higher\"purpose (better chance to protect themselves, getting food easier, other benefits)<\/p>\n\n<p>I am particlarly interested in apes, excluding us, of course.<\/p>\n","question_id":7589,"tags":["zoology","mammals","behaviour","sociality"],"score":-1,"accepted_answer_id":7598,"down_vote_count":4,"is_answered":true,"view_count":207,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1375452708},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c7672678c3e0413ccf50327d46dd4f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":554,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/554/jim-thio","reputation":505,"display_name":"Jim Thio","accept_rate":65},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1d3326342ee9de40822577d766465e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":72,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/72/yamad","reputation":2340,"display_name":"yamad"},"score":4,"post_id":1419,"edited":false,"creation_date":1332172452,"comment_id":1839,"body":"Can you rephrase the question so that the example is not directly political?

This is not like a gorilla troop, where only one male breeds, and the rest contribute to mutual security.  A more typical example is a honeybee or an ant, where the vast majority of the hive have no ability to reproduce at all.  This happens in animals, but is relatively rare. Its causes are currently the subject of intense debate but as far as I know, the only cases are where you do this for others who are genetically similar to you.   That logic sort of plays out as you say: \"My brother has kids, why do I need to have any? I'll just help out a little bit there.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Cooperation includes forming groups for mutual safety and increased competition for food resources are why you might vote or schlep down to the DMV to get a drivers license when simply getting in your car without might be just as good most of the time.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Cooperation is incredibly common in biology.  It even happens between species.  A dolphin helps a ship navigate submerged rocks, symbiotic bacteria in our gut help us digest food, but also get enough to live and reproduce.

The process of selection in evolution removes the the worst individuals from the gene pool, thus those with comparatively good genes survive to reproduce. With physical traits these mechanisms are well understood, with behaviour there are still multiple theories which have not been concluded but our understanding of them is reasonably complete. <\/p>\n\n<p>Inclusive fitness is the combination of direct and indirect fitness, direct being your personal fitness, indirect being fitness gained from others. In general this is measured in terms of reproductive success (RS) (the number of offspring you successfully raise to reproductive maturity). Out of this understanding came <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_rule#Hamilton.27s_rule\">Hamilton's Rule<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>                               r.b &gt; c\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Where <em>r<\/em> is the relatedness, <em>b<\/em> is the benefit &amp; <em>c<\/em> is the cost. In this scenario the cost is a reduction in RS, the benefit is a gain in RS. Benefits are multiplied by the relatedness to the offspring. In normal diploid organisms (Gets DNA from both parents) you are related by 0.5 (half from mother, half from father), but only related to your brother/sister's offspring by 0.25. Thus, if you have two children you have a <em>direct<\/em> fitness of 1, if your brother has two children you gain an <em>indirect<\/em> fitness of 0.5. Thus, you would prefer under normal circumstances to have your own children rather than raise your brothers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Altruism is suffering a cost for someone else's benefit, @Winawer mentions the greenbeard theory, which rests on the assumption that if you can tell someone has the same genes as you then you <em>know<\/em> that you are related to them in someway and this will be on average be greater than to any other individual. Altruism is a behaviour, defined above, and not a specific action like giving up your own reproduction, thus it is a part of cooperation and not separate from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is true that there are different forms of altruism however these are all just perspectives pertaining to the same theory. <strong>ALL<\/strong> behaviour is selfish, reciprocal altruism is just an example of this. Reciprocal altruism, is \"If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" (You need help now, I may need help in the future), it is altruistic because you suffer a cost for another's benefit but it is selfish because it is still in the individual's interest to help. This is where prisoners dilemma comes in, this is basically asking the question \"how do I pick the most optimal situation in this scenario?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>For simplicity, it is generally ill advised to study behaviours in humans because of the implicit bias we have in our judgment on ourselves. From political and religious associations that cloud judgment to the fact that we always strive to see ourselves differently. Also, there are all sorts of ethical difficulties in actually testing and manipulating theories on us. Thus we normally study animals to get around this. However your question specifically talks about people so I will try and answer this based on biological theory alone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on the foundations above, why would someone behave altruistically to someone only 'similar' to you? The biggest difficulty is knowing that we understand all the costs and benefits involved, most of the time we only know some of them and its impossible that you can know all of them because you can't know what you don't know. Humans have effectively 'bootstrapped' behaviours which are 'for the good of society' building on from previously developed behaviours. However we are still fundamentally asking a question about Hamilton's Rule. Being seen as a part of society induces altruistic behaviour towards you (because you are seen as worth something), this is good for you and the costs associated with being altruistic are usually low. Thus you would never <em>rationally<\/em> die for 1000 unrelated individuals unless you had at least had all the children you were going to have and raised them to be independent. But you would vote, by voting you suffer a tiny cost, your time, for a huge benefit. Benefits might include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Being seen as caring for others (altruism given to you)<\/li>\n<li>Possible benefits to yourself (less tax, more support, better roads, clean air.. etc)<\/li>\n<li>Possible benefits to others related to you<\/li>\n<li>General good moral of your community, leading to a better life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There could be thousands of other benefits that I can't, off the top of my head, think of. The cost is negligible and the benefit is intangible but probably higher than the cost. Relatedness isn't important (so long as it is greater than 0), if the cost is sufficiently low or the benefit is sufficiently high. I hope this has helped clarify your thinking and answer the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further information:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wikipedia is great for getting an overview of terms and definitions, but remain critical of what you could be reading.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A decent book on animal behaviour in general is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Animal-Behavior-An-Evolutionary-Approach/dp/0878932259/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336211529&amp;sr=8-1\">Alcock J.
