Corresponding to these events the ECG reads are marked. As you can see the distance between the T wave ( the small bump after the QRS complex) and the next P wave corresponds to the diastole. As you can see the pressure changes correlate well with the electric reads from the heart. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography\" rel=\"nofollow\">This<\/a> wiki page has great descriptions of the features of the ECG and the corresponding events.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example P to QRS corresponds to the conduction of stimulus from the sine node to AV node, or QRS depicts the rapid depolarization and repoliarization of the ventricles. This latter leads to strong muscle contraction and this causes intaventicular pressure rise, that is followed by aortic pressure change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: Sorry, for missing the key point, I totally misunderstood what you needed. I'll try to correct my mistake (I'll leave the previous info as it may be useful for others) The authors of this paper did a really nice work on modeling and measuring left ventricle contraction time and other things.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reference: (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1434992/pdf/biophysj00204-0121.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyar and Sidman 1984<\/a>)<br>\nLong story short: the contraction of the ventricle depends on the initial amount of blood (preload), aortic blood pressure at the end (afterload), and intial contractility. The results are summarized in three tables:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yOMW9.png\" alt=\"preload\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Le7kR.png\" alt=\"afterload\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nxCNE.png\" alt=\"contractility\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the last columns, the ejection time varies with the parameters. The ejection time that is required for the ventricle to push the blood out to the aorta. Under normal circumstances a complete heart cycle is about 0.8s (or 800ms) this pie char shows the time ratio of main events.

In abnormal relaxation, IVRT is usually in excess of 110 ms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Isovolumic relaxation is when the muscle relaxes, yet the volume of the ventricle remains the same, thus only the internal pressure changes (it is analogue to isovolumic contraction - when the volume is unchanged, but pressure is built up, this happens at early ventricle contraction).<\/p>\n","answer_id":31703,"question_id":31681,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1447314102}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31681/how-long-do-the-periods-of-systole-and-diastole-last","last_activity_date":1447314102,"creation_date":1429884764,"answer_count":1,"title":"How long do the periods of systole and diastole last?","body":"<p>The background to this is i'm doing some work using ECGs for an animation of the heart and i'm having trouble defining the end points of these periods, particularly diastole.

The Beer-Lambert law is linear when A is between approx. 0.1 and 1.0.<\/p>\n\n<p>So take a dilute solution of the algae and starting at the smallest wave length of light that the device can emit (you can vary the wavelength?). Take readings of the Absorbance and then increase the wavelength by 10 nm. Starting at deep purple, and ending at far red, write down the A values. Plot this data with A on the Y-Axis and wavelength in nm on the X-axis. There should be a distinct maxima in the curve, that is the most sensitive wavelength, and is the one you should use for all your experiments. If the algae is green, then the maxima should be over in the red end of the spectrum (like chlorophyll).<\/p>\n\n<p>Next you need to make a standard curve that correlates the Absorbance at lambda max with the number of algal cells in the cuvette (the test tube you put in the colorimeter). That means you need an independent method of counting the number of algal cells. If they were bacteria or yeast then you could plate them on agar-filled Petri dishes and count the number of cells per mL (for example). For some cells if you have a high powered microscope and a hemocytometer then you could visually count the number of cells per mL. If neither of these methods are available then you could measure the mass of algal cells by weighing them on a balance.<\/p>\n\n<p>So by some method you will be able to plot the number of cells in the broth vs. the Absorbance (plot A on the Y-axis).<\/p>\n\n<p>From this you can empirically determine the molar extinction coefficient of these algal cells.  Then you just need to measure the Absorbance at lambda max on  dilute aliquot of the cell culture and you will have an accurate measurement of the number of cells per mL. <\/p>\n\n<p>With this assay working then you can inoculate a bunch of identical cultures, that vary by the pH of the growth medium. By removing small aliquots of the cultures at the same time points you will be able to plot the number of cells (on the Y-axis) versus the time they have been growing, and you will see if varying the pH alters the shape or magnitude of these growth curves.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40501,"question_id":40427,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40427/how-to-measure-growth-of-algae-with-colorimeter","last_activity_date":1447207364,"creation_date":1447031314,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to measure growth of algae with colorimeter","body":"<p>I am doing an lab for IB Bio and don't know how to use a colorimeter to measure growth in algae.

Strictly speaking it's not correct to say that mitochondria oxidize <em>fat<\/em>. By \"fat\" we usually mean triacylglycerides, and these must first be hydrolyzed into free fatty acids (by enzymes known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase\" rel=\"nofollow\">lipases<\/a>) that can be oxidized in the mitochondria. But many researchers and textbook authors are not always careful with this distinction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most fatty acids are indeed oxidized (\"digested\" sounds strange to me) in the mitochondria into acetyl-CoA units, in a process known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_oxidation\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta-oxidation<\/a>. The acetyl-CoA units produced are then further oxidized into CO$_2$ by the TCA cycle. These processes generate NADH and FADH$_2$ which is converted into ATP by the respiratory chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are exceptions though. Very long-chain or branched fatty acids are instead <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488906002485\" rel=\"nofollow\">oxidized in peroxisomes<\/a>, which contain enzymes specialized for this purpose.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no such thing as \"anaerobic respiration\": in animals, respiration always uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

Peroxisomal oxidation is not directly coupled to respiration, but the process still requires oxygen, which in this case is reduced directly by the fatty acid oxidases.

If you prefer, it very much depends on how you define a human! Some women are completely sterile while others are highly fertile and there is genetic predisposition to that.  How much \"perfect\" should the genotype of an individual be so that it is still considered as a human? There is genetic variance underlying fecundity that is important to consider. For example, in your calculation you took lifespan as a constant but it obviously is not a constant. Fecundity is reduced by all these small mutations segregating in the human populations that reduce the fecundity of any single human. There exist no human that is free from all deleterious alleles. Imagine a giant woman with 10 independent reproductive system! Would she still be a human? That was probably kind of a too extreme thought experiment. Imagine a woman that can have a reproductive lifespan of 100 years. Would it still be a human? The issue behind this question reminds me an old post (now closed, I can't find it anymore) that asked whether a leopard would run faster if it had more legs. Well... one can imagine something running faster than a leopard, but it would not be a leopard anymore. So how many changes from a leopard are we allowed to make to answer the question. So I had to chose a definition of what a \"perfect woman\" is. Or a definition of a woman that would set this so called biological limit.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>The definition I am using to answer this question<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In the below answer, I will assume that by biological limit you mean the expected fitness of a female that would live in the same environment than we live in today but would not carry any single of the deleterious locus that are segregating in the human population. In other words I assume that you accept that the \"perfect woman\", that is a woman that would not carry any single of the deleterious mutations that segregate in the populations will set this biological limit to woman maximal fecundity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutation load Theory<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The decrease in the mean fitness of an idealized population where no deleterious mutations would exist compared to the realized mean fitness of a population is called the mutation load. The mutation (in an infinite population) is a function of the genome-wide mutation rate only. Let the genome-wide mutation rate in human be $U=2.2$, the mutation load $L$ in the human population is equal to $L=1-e^{-2.2}=0.89$. The estimates are taken from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jctvV5xrWw4&amp;spfreload=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">this video<\/a>. You may want to have a look to the video in order to have a better understanding of why $L=1-e^{-U}$ and what are the assumptions of these calculations. The main assumptions are 1) infinite population size, 2) multiplicity of fitness effects at different loci and 3) additivity of fitness effect between alleles at the same locus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So what does mutation load theory predicts?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The above calculation means that segregating deleterious allele reduce the fitness of the average woman by 89%! If we assume that an average woman can have 10 babies (this number is just a random guess) if she wants to, then the maximum biological limit of a \"perfect woman\" (in a world where there is no more competition than the one in which we are living) is $\\frac{10}{1-0.89}≈91$  babies!<\/p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_the_most_children\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>, the world record is 69 and is owned by Mrs. Vassilyev. It is reasuring to see that the observed world record (69) is lower than the the biological limit we just calculated (91). If we were to know the distribution of maximal number of babies per woman (not to be confused with the realized number of babies), we could calculate the probability to have 69 or more babies and compare this probability to the total number of females that has ever lived (or the total number of females that would have never had the idea to have so many babies). Always according to wikipedia, the world record for men would be 867 and is owned by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ismail Ibn Sharif<\/a>. However, sounds possible to me (but I really have no idea) that some sperm donor may have overshoot this number today.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31065,"question_id":31063,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1428245571},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/850a6be54844c09f756356e422da39cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":19922,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19922/pedro-cosme","reputation":1,"display_name":"Pedro Cosme"},"score":-3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":3,"last_activity_date":1447097285,"creation_date":1447083022,"body":"<p>The maximum would be 36 child assuming that:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is used IVF<\/li>\n<li>By transferring three pre-embryos at each attempt (on average, 1.27 child by pregnancy)<\/li>\n<li>After giving birth, it is done one transferring a month (on average, a pregnancy each  year)<\/li>\n<li>The woman is able to deliver (not necessary fertile) for 30 years.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":40448,"question_id":31063,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1447097285}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31063/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-babies-a-human-woman-can-have","last_activity_date":1447097285,"creation_date":1428163517,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is the maximum number of babies a human woman can have?","body":"<p>I know you could divide the female fertility period (~40 years, right?) by 9 months which would give something like ~50 kids (with no multiple kids per pregnancy).

( I think...  D:   )    <\/p>\n\n<p>So from what I understand, uncouplers stop the \"connection\" of the ETC and ATP synthase indirectly. And in our lab period we used a hydrogen ionophore(ammonia) as our uncoupler( I think... D:  ).  <\/p>\n\n<p>So for our results I obtained this graph**(The Y axis should be absorbance(600nm)) sorry**...: <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lsrO3.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lsrO3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Where tube 1 through 3 was a collection of thykloid membranes isolated from spinach leaves; tube 1 being kept in foil until the 10th min mark to then measure absorbance as a control. Where tube 2 and 3 were exposed to light for the 10mins, with absorbance readings being taking every 1 min. And with tube 3 having the added ammonia(from what I understand, the uncoupler). <\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore how does the ammonia uncoupler speed up the electron transport chain? <\/p>\n\n<p>My thoughts after googling are that since PQ( plastoquinone) is partially responsible for establishing the proton gradient for the thylakoid mebrane, since it transports H+ ions from the stroma to the lumen upon reduction, that if there was this ammonia uncoupler, that could travel through the membrane due to its lack of charge, it could then bind with the H+ ions forming $\\ce{NH4+}$ in the lumen. <\/p>\n\n<p>So then if the lumen now has less H+ ions then the high(lumen) to low(stroma) H+ gradient would be ruined/weakened. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So this is the part I guess confused with; if there is less of a H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane, then how does that have any bearing on the reduction of the added DCPIP or the speed at which its reduced?<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Since tube 3 went the fastest to clear( ~0 absorbance), this is only when it is reduced yes? This means then that in tube 3, the reduction of DCPIP  happened the fastest. <\/p>\n\n<p>So then does this mean that DCPIP, the artificial electron acceptor, takes over for PQ somehow? Why does PQ have trouble \"doing its job\" in the presence of the weakened H+ gradient?<\/p>\n\n<p>P.S: Sorry for the rambling, but I felt including my train of thought was important for others to see where I  misunderstood. <\/p>\n","question_id":40416,"tags":["photosynthesis","chloroplasts"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":120,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54a82fba3ce9f146c47e561b973f6adf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5851,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5851/caters","reputation":341,"display_name":"Caters","accept_rate":36},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":38618,"edited":false,"creation_date":1441728639,"comment_id":64314,"body":"No. Primate babies require a <i>lot<\/i> of care, as a significant amount of development occurs post-partum.

This is the precise reason in <em>Drosophila<\/em>, <a href=\"https://sib.illinois.edu/pittendrigh/documents/SOP_Collecting_Virgin_Flies.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">virgin collection<\/a> is done within 4 hours of eclosion. <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine you want to set up cross between wild type and some mutant.

In this step it is important that females should be virgin else it will be difficult to track your genotype later on. Now if <em>Drosophila<\/em> starts mating soon after emergence of flies, it is disadvantage for your <strong>breeding<\/strong> experiments. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note: There is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6743/full/400449a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sperm competition<\/a> but that is special case<\/p>\n","answer_id":40398,"question_id":40397,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1446988858}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40397/disadvantage-of-using-drosophila-for-breeding-experiment","last_activity_date":1446988858,"creation_date":1446962992,"answer_count":1,"title":"Disadvantage of using Drosophila for breeding experiment","body":"<p>What should be the disadvantage of using Drosophila for experiments?<\/p>\n\n<p>a)small size of larva.\nb)short life cycle. \nc)mating soon after emergence of flies.\nd)large number of offsprings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Options (b) and (d) should be advantages.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that the answer should be (a) as small larvae would be difficult to maintain. <\/p>\n\n<p>Given answer is(c).<\/p>\n\n<p>Why is that?<\/p>\n","question_id":40397,"tags":["homework","experimental-design","drosophila"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":40398,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":107,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61c96b63684953323e2d0b8b1b329da9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10184,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10184/user1205901","reputation":219,"display_name":"user1205901","accept_rate":60},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":1,"post_id":40390,"edited":false,"creation_date":1446983365,"comment_id":68002,"body":"why the downvote?"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61c96b63684953323e2d0b8b1b329da9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10184,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10184/user1205901","reputation":219,"display_name":"user1205901","accept_rate":60},"score":1,"post_id":40392,"edited":false,"creation_date":1446954381,"comment_id":67982,"body":"Your answer tells us about the most recent common ancestor of of the grey wolf, dogs, and the extinct Taymyr wolf.

Together with the term constitutive they refer to how transcription takes place, that is, the second phase in the central dogma that states that genetic information is propagated from replication to transcription to translation. The proteins that are produced during translation by ribosomes can have a feedback effect on replication and transcription.<\/p>\n\n<p>When proteins bind to the promoter region of genes, they can induce or inhibit transcription. If a gene is preceded by a promoter region that always promotes transcription, it is said that the gene has a constitutive promoter. If the gene is transcribed conditionally, it may refer to proteins having to bind to the promoter region so that transcription can take place. There could be inverse situations and I believe the Cre/Lox technology is an example of such a situation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take the following as an example. A gene could be lethal meaning that if the protein it encodes is expressed it will kill the cell. It could have a promoter that promotes expression if a protein with an inhibitory effect is not bound to the promoter. Suppose I have these cells in a culture plate and I add some compound to the culture plate. The compound diffuses into the cells and binds to the inhibitory protein that is bound to the promoter region. With this binding of the compound to the protein that is in turn bound to the promoter region, the protein loses its ability to bind to the promoter region and inhibition of transcription is uplifted. Transcription then continues and expression of the lethal protein takes place after which the cell dies.<\/p>\n\n<p>This could be used in practice as follow: if you were selling seeds to farmers, you would want them to buy seeds next year again, so you want the plant not to be able to produce viable seeds. <\/p>\n\n<p>Coming back to your question, if you want to know more about the mice in question, you should contact the breeder as nomenclatures differ.

IR vision is used more in the form of general heat detection.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004269899490149X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benett &amp; Cuthill, <em>Vis Res<\/em> (1994); <strong>34<\/strong>(11): 1471\u20138<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1455745\" rel=\"nofollow\">Griswold &amp; Stark, <em>Vis Res<\/em> (1992); <strong>32<\/strong>(9):1739-43<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v353/n6345/abs/353655a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jacobs <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Nature<\/em> (1991); <strong>353<\/strong>: 655-6<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1982-22934-001\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newman <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Sci Am<\/em> (1982); <strong>246<\/strong>(3): 116-27<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6958/full/nature01971.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Winter <em>et al<\/em>, <em>Nature<\/em> (2003); <strong>425<\/strong>: 612-4<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":40305,"question_id":40249,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1446872395}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40249/how-can-some-animals-see-ultraviolet-or-infrared-light","last_activity_date":1446872395,"creation_date":1446573815,"answer_count":2,"title":"How can some animals see ultraviolet or infrared light?","body":"<p>I know that some animals like birds, bees, and fish can see ultraviolet and infrared light.
