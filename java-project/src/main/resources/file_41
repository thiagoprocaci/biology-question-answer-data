The increase in the number of copies is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication\" rel=\"nofollow\">gene duplication<\/a> (or gene amplification or chromosomal duplication when a very big chunk of DNA gets duplicated). The decrease in the number of copies is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">gene deletion<\/a>.

The exception is genes on the X and Y chromosomes, but that's complicated so I'll ignore it :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, that's not to say that there might be several <em>versions<\/em> of any particular gene, having arisen through such mutational events as Remi.b explained. So, in antiquity, gene <em>ABC123<\/em> might have been duplicated, leading to today's genes <em>ABC123a<\/em> and <em>ABC123b<\/em>, which may or may not have different functions. But, for <em>ABC123a<\/em>, there are only two copies per (normal) cell, and the same is true for <em>ABC123b<\/em> and all the rest.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are they all transcribed at the same rate?<\/p>\n  \n  <p>But I wonder if one particular gene coding for a protein we need in abundance might be present in many copies in the genome to increase expression.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression\" rel=\"nofollow\">regulation of gene expression<\/a> is quite complex. However, the cell (I'm referring to eukaryotes here, I don't know how different prokaryotes and Archaea are) has mechanisms to ensure that the products of so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">housekeeping genes<\/a>, which are needed in great abundance, are available to the cell. One method is to attract and keep the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase\" rel=\"nofollow\">RNA polymerases<\/a> (which transcribe the gene into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is the template for translation into a protein - the actual gene product) bound to the gene sequence through a variety of DNA \"promoter\" and \"enhancer\" sequences, which other proteins called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">transcription factors<\/a> bind to and recruit the polymerase to the gene. These polymerases are kept active for as long as the cell needs the gene's protein product, churning out copy after copy of mRNA. There are many other mechanisms as well, ranging from how the core histone proteins that give chromosomes their shape bind near the gene, to the manner in which the translation machinery (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">ribosomes<\/a>) bind to the mRNA and produce multiple protein molecules per mRNA copy. So, even though we may only have two copies of a particularly vital gene, the cell has evolved ways of meeting demand for its product.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are they all transcribed at the same rate?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, they are not. This all depends on the number, kind, and placement of transcription factor binding sequences in the DNA surrounding and within a gene, as well as the exact identity of the transcription factor(s) recruited. Some keep the polymerase machinery very tightly bound, ensuring quick and accurate transcription, while others don't bind tightly at all, allowing the polymerase to \"fall off\" the DNA and/or work more slowly.

Crosslinking is required for the original B Cell Recpetors to activate the B Cell, and it is also useful in clumping antigen in a way that it can be eaten by macrophages or otherwise interfering with the function of the antigen.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36814,"question_id":25982,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25982/binding-of-multivalent-antibody-to-mutiple-epitopes","last_activity_date":1439476022,"creation_date":1418839548,"answer_count":2,"title":"Binding of Multivalent Antibody to mutiple epitopes?","body":"<ol>\n<li>A multivalent antibody molecule such as Immunoglobulin M Immunoglobulin A etc bind to more than one antigens or epitopes but I am confused about that wheather these multivalent antibodies bind to identical epitopes or can bind to different epitopes? means if one molecule of Immunoglobulin M being pentameric can bind to 10 epitopes at a time the 10 epitopes that it binds Will be identical or can be different..?

And Chris gave an excellent answer above, describing how antibodies go through 'germinal center reactions' that improve the affinity of responding cells. However, Jamie actually brings up several concepts that are worth discussing and there is another important element to the immune response that Chris touches on, but could be elaborated.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Where do naive B Cells come from? When are they produced?<\/li>\n<li>How many unique B Cells do we have?<\/li>\n<li>What happens to cells during an immune reaction?<\/li>\n<li>How do naive and memory B Cells (among other post-exposure cellular subsets) compare?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Briefly, \n(1)  B Cells arise from progenitor cells living in the <strong><em>bone marrow.<\/em><\/strong> They are produced <strong><em>continuously throughout the life<\/em><\/strong> of the organism - or at least until 'old age' when hematopoiesis is qualitatively and quantitatively compromised(<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15963731\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerstein<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556507000277\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancro<\/a>, among others address this problem). <\/p>\n\n<p>(2) How many? That's a good question. The number of cells seems to be dependent upon the mass of the organism (indirectly through a cytokine called BLyS). There are a lot of subtleties governing the number and 'quality' of our cells that BLyS concentration seems to regulate, but, for the most part, we can assume that each B Cell (like each T Cell) reacts to a different target (epitope). The reason I bring up the BLyS thing is that it shows us that 'space' is limited, and the body is making decisions all the time about what cells to keep and what cells to discard.<\/p>\n\n<p>(3) During an immune reaction, some small subset of cells 'sees' its target via it's B Cell Receptor (this is a surface-bound version of the antibodies that this cell will make later). Most cells will remain blind to the infection / whatever. The ones that do see their target expand (multiply), while those that don't, don't. This is Burnett's Clonal Expansion Theory (probably best explained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_selection#cite_note-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>) and it states that we have only a small number of cells that are useful for each immune reaction, but these can divide and activate rapidly to participate in the response. When the infection is over, most cells die, but some subsets will remain, these are memory cells and their relatives (e.g. long-lived plasma cells). Imagine that for every unique B Cell you had before, now you have 100 memory cells (I'm making up that number) that are capable of responding to the same target. \nAlthough I'm sure there are differences between these memory cells and naive cells, it's easiest to ignore that part and just think that now you will be starting with 100x the number of cells you had prior to the primary response.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to get to your basic question: why not just start with the memory cells? It's a question of <strong><em>space<\/em><\/strong>. Your immune system provides you with a broad repertoire because it has no idea what it's going to see during your life. But once it sees something once, it is ready for a second showing. (i.e. It is reasonable to think that if you have micro-organism X in your neck of the woods, you may come into contact with it more than once, so after that first time, you are now better prepared with more cells that already demonstrated that they were helpful once before. )<\/p>\n","answer_id":36792,"question_id":16542,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16542/if-all-b-cells-are-present-at-birth-why-should-the-primary-response-to-an-infec","last_activity_date":1439398054,"creation_date":1397485910,"answer_count":2,"title":"If all B cells are present at birth, why should the primary response to an infection take longer than the secondary response?","body":"<p>When learning about the immune response, my teacher mentioned that all the bodies B cells are present at birth, and there is one to counter every disease.

Rather, they are motivated by biological questions and their research that often require higher biosafty for their labs.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the researchers featured in a recent (July 2015) <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/ebola/quammen-text\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>National Geographic<\/em><\/a> do not study Ebola because they want to work on a BSL-4 level virus. Rather they want to about learn about the disease from both a basic science and applied human heath perspective. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your hypothetical Dr. Kliener would not work his way up the biosafety chain as a conscious. Let's say a young Mr. Kliener always wanted to study human health. He probably would have started doing research in a BSL-2 facility as an undergrad research assistant (See BSL-2 requirements <a href=\"http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/vpfa/operations/Risk%20Management/biosafety/bsl2\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. As a grad student, he might have worked at a BSL-3 lab if he choose a good program while spending years focusing on a specific pathogen or system. By the time he became because a PI, he would have needed to find a BSL-3 facility for his research. He worked his way up, but not because he wanted to study dangerous pathogens. Rather his research question guided his path.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other career tracks could end up using a BSL-3 facility, but not necessarily need the stop at a BSL-2 facility. For example, a hypothetical Dr. Fish may have started off loving the outdoors. She studied limnology as an undergrad and grad student and did not step foot inside a lab. However, when she began working as biologists for a state conservation agency, a novel fish virus emerged. She now is tasked with studying it. Her agency trained her to work in a BSL-3 lab so she could culture fish with their virologists.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36774,"question_id":36716,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f94e67a8de70fccd254ef725a3e494a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16147,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16147/inactionpotential","reputation":519,"display_name":"InactionPotential"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1439390551,"creation_date":1439390551,"body":"<p>Here's a nice little walk-through by the CDC on Biosafety levels.

According to one source [4] on the telomere wiki page, vertebrates commonly have a repeating sequence of TTAGGG.

Chromosomes will vary in length during the lifetime due to telomere reduction. I will not consider this in the following calculations. Also, some mutations directly introduce (or delete) a large number of nucleotides (transposable elements for example), I am not considering those mutations here, assuming they are rare in comparison to to single insertions and single deletions (this assumption might not hold!). So please really take the following with a grain of salt.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Let's make some messy calculations<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In classical theoretical population genetics, we tend to consider mostly substitutions. But I can maybe try to make some extrapolation out of this work if you allow me to make some strong assumptions, use poor estimates of actual true values and using some non-rigorous mathematics! This is going to be ugly and not extremely trustful $\\ddot \\smile $.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not explaining why this is true (it is a result coming from Coalescent Theory), the expected number of pairwise differences between two neutral sequences for a diploid population is $E[\\pi] = 4\\cdot N\\cdot \\mu$ (quite an impressively simple result), where $N$ is the population size (assuming panmictic population) and $\\mu$ is the mutation rate for the whole sequence. Assuming a constant per site mutation rate of $\\mu_s = 10^-9$. Knowing the length of the sequence of interest (chromosom X) $L ≈ 1.55 \\cdot 10^8 $, the mutation rate for the whole sequence is $\\mu = L\\cdot \\mu_s = 0.155$. Let's consider a population size of $N = 5 \\cdot 10^7$ (the equations assume a panmictic population so I just took some value that felt more or less reasonable to me much smaller than the actual worldwide population size). Therefore the total number of substitutions should be $E[\\pi] = 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^7 \\cdot 0.155 ≈ 10^7$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let's assume that only a fraction of $\\frac{1}{100}$ of the mutations bring variation in the number of nucleotides, we might want consider the value $\\frac{1}{100} \\cdot 10^7 = 10^3$. And because a mutation that deletes a nucleotide from a long sequence will rather diminish the number of variant in sequence length that increasing it, let's say that will divide this number by 10!... so I'd say that two typical X chromosome would differ in length by about 100 nucleotides.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am sure that with some work one can come up with more rigorous calculations and a more accurate expectation. Intuitively, the result of 100 nucleotides doesn't sound totally crazy (it is not 1 nor 10^6 at least).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, one could probably use available sequence data to estimate this value.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36714,"question_id":36710,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1439324662},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ead69c6502bbb609c34710a0e81572c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17201,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17201/unknown","reputation":55,"display_name":"unknown"},"score":0,"post_id":36728,"edited":false,"creation_date":1439242083,"comment_id":61439,"body":"Interesting numbers.

If you look at the size of a any cell from a whale and compare it to the size of any of cells from a mouse, they are in fact quite similar, despite the extreme difference in the overall size of the organisms they are from. There is a reason why cells are small, and it has to do with the fact that they survive based on their ability to absorb enough nutrients from their environment. As a cell gets larger it needs more to survive (because it has a bigger mass). A bigger cell has also has a larger surface area around it (so it can absorb more nutrients).<\/p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, there gets to be a point where the mass of the cell is too large for the surface area to compensate for. Mathematically this is shown by what is called the \"surface-area-to-volume ratio\". Basically, it states that as a a sphere gets larger, the volume increases at a higher RATE than the surface area. So there is a reason cells get only so big, the 60's horror movie The Blob was not scientifically accurate, a single-cell that large (the blob) would not have enough surface area to absorb enough nutrients to sustain itself. Taller (or bigger) people have more cells (not bigger ones) than others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Effects of osmotic pressure can alter cell size slightly.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you are talking about taller individuals, you are (I think) really meaning larger people, people with a higher mass. And yes, they have more cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another topic of Cell Biology you may want to explore is apoptosis. Let's say you have two individuals both 180 lbs. one of them is 5' tall and the other 7'. Both these individuals have the same number of cells, but the taller one has a higher percentage of them in the superior and inferior regions of the body.

But then all eukaryotes are believed to have a common ancestor that lived an eon ago. Hence the notion of phylogenetic relevance is relative by definition. That means that all species are related, but when you take a bunch of them you can try to reconstruct the order of speciation. This can be achieved by calculating distances (e.g. genetic sequence distances, morphological distances) and applying an evolutionary model.

From this point of view you might say that it's easier to estimate ancestry than it is to estimate distance, but then you will be over-simplifying things to such an extent, that you will drop the fact that there is no way you can speak about ancestry without having some distance estimations in the first place.

The predator-prey equations capture assumptions about how prey and predator interact with each other, and how they would fare on their own. These assumptions are not equivalent to any reasonable assumptions about the glucose-insulin system. The fact that both prey and predator population sizes as well as glucose and insulin concentrations oscillate is not enough to say the two systems may be modelled by the same equations. In fact, the oscillations in the figures you show are very different form each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let us go through some of the assumptions of the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to see why most of them do not resemble anything related to the glucose-insulin system.<\/p>\n\n<p>1) In the absence of predators, the prey population grows exponentially without limits. This follows from self-reproduction. If glucose were likened to prey, glucose would increase exponentially in the absence of insulin. If prey were likened to insulin, insulin would increase exponentially in the absence of glucose. Is that reasonable?<\/p>\n\n<p>2) The population growth rate of the prey is reduced by a quantity proportional to the population sizes of both prey and predator. The underlying assumption is that prey and predator meet a rate proportional to their population densities and that a fraction of these encounters leads to the death of the prey. The assumption about the encounter rate is called the Law of Mass-Action, and applies well to chemical compounds in a liquid, like glucose and insulin. However, glucose and insulin do not interact directly, and it is not clear to me how realistic assumptions abut their interaction would work out.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) New predators are born at a rate proportional to the encounter rate in 2). In the glucose-insulin system this would mean that more insulin is produced if more insulin is present. Is that realistic?<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer to these questions is, according to me, \"no\".<\/p>\n\n<p>(On a side note: the Lotka-Volterra model is structurally unstable, meaning that slightest change in the assumptions would fundamentally alter the outcome of the model. One of these outcomes are neutrally stable predator-prey cycles, that is, cycles of which the amplitude and period depend on the initial population sizes. Changing the assumption that the prey population grows exponentially by including a term - $m \\times x^2$ to the first equation changes the oscillations into damped oscillations so that the populations settle at a stable equilibrium.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":36369,"question_id":36291,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1438003222},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f62753af7358a4e121b302800ce50637?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16326,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16326/edm","reputation":580,"display_name":"EdM"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":36372,"edited":false,"creation_date":1437802580,"comment_id":60395,"body":"Negative feedbacks can lose oscillations if certain parameters are  changed.

Your rate equations will now look like:<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha[t_{gi} &lt; t&lt; t_{gf}]-\\beta x y$<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\delta x-\\gamma x y$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $x$ is glucose concentration, $y$ is insulin concentration, and $[t_{gi} &lt; t&lt; t_{gf}]$ is equal to 1 if the current time $t$ is greater than the time when the glucose spike starts $t_{gi}$ and less than the time when the glucose spike ends $t_{gf}$, and is equal to zero if the time $t$ does not meet this condition. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Simulation of insulin-glucose dynamics using the above LV model<\/h2>\n\n<p>I ran a simulation of the above model in Matlab, and here's what it looks like:\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FWpD2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FWpD2.png\" alt=\"simulation of basic LV model of IG dynamics\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The basic features of the insulin-glucose dynamics from the example graph the OP posted are present. Just like in the real system, first the glucose spikes, then the insulin spikes after a short lag, then they both return to baseline.<\/p>\n\n<h1>With some small improvements, the LV model can capture the dynamics of the infamous \"sugar crash\" phenomenon<\/h1>\n\n<p>Now for the really cool part.<\/p>\n\n<p>As can be seen on the OP's graph, glucose levels tend to fall somewhat below their baseline following a large glucose spike. This is the physiological basis for the sugar crash that people sometimes get a little while after eating something really sugary like a candy bar. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/25/do-children-really-get-sugar-rush-hyperactivity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regardless of whether the psychological symptoms actually occur<\/a>, the dip in glucose levels is a real thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order for a model to be considered \"good\", it has to be able to capture these kinds of complex but important phenomena in their underlying systems. The glucose dip did not show up in my original LV model, so the question is, can the model be modified in a simple way so that it will capture the dip? Let's take another crack at it!<\/p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem with trying to study phenomena related to baseline levels using the previous model is that the baseline levels of both insulin and glucose are effectively fixed at 0 in that model. We can set the baseline levels by adding what's called a zeroth-order production term (essentially a fixed constant that isn't multiplied by the concentration of anything) to each of our rate equations. The rate equations now look like:<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha[t_{gi} &lt; t&lt; t_{gf}]+\\epsilon-\\beta x y$<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\delta x+\\eta-\\gamma x y$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $\\epsilon$ is the 0th order glucose production term, $\\eta$ is the 0th order insulin production term, and everything else is exactly the same.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Simulation of insulin-glucose dynamics using the \"dip-enabled\" LV model<\/h2>\n\n<p>Again using Matlab, I ran a simulation of the \"dip-enabled\" LV model:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2Nkc.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2Nkc.png\" alt=\"simulation of dip enabled LV model of IG dynamics\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>and this time the dip shows up.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Notes:<\/h3>\n\n<p>-The term with the times in it is called an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iverson Bracket<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>-You could make this model more physiologically relevant by using a more complex function for the glucose spike, but for simplicity's sake we'll stick with a linear function.

The red nucleus may play an additional role in controlling muscles of the shoulder and upper arm via projections of its magnocellular part.<\/p>\n\n<p>b. In <strong>decerebrate posturing<\/strong> the rubrospinal tract is also cut, since the lesion is below the red nucleus. In this scenario the <strong>reticular activating system<\/strong> (aka <strong>reticulospinal tract<\/strong>) is the dominant output to the motor neurons of the body. Here you get the classic extensor pose, for both upper and lower limbs...<\/p>\n\n<p><em>The point is<\/em>: Rubrospinal tract was what you were missing. The red nucleus is the specific part of the basal ganglia that is involved...<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>2) \nthe difference between spasticity vs rigidity:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>spasticity is an increased resistance to the passive movement of a\njoint due to abnormally high muscle tone (hypertonus) which varies\nwith the amplitude and speed of displacement of a joint.  <\/li>\n<li>rigidity is an increased resistance to the passive movement of a joint which is\nconstant throughout the range of joint displacement and not related\nto the speed of joint movement. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>your supposed to test this out on patients to get a feel for what's the difference.<\/p>\n\n<p>spaciticity is the case for upper motor neurons lesions (ex. stroke), since the spinal reflexes are not being inhibited from above...<\/p>\n\n<p>an example of rigidity in neurology is Parkinson's disease, which is the loss of the substantial nigra, which like the red nucleus is also in the midbrain... while the the substantial nigra and basal ganglia loop do influence the motor control of the body... they are not upper motor neurons. Upper motor neuron is specific to the corticospianl tract, it is the neuron going from cortex to anterior horn of spinal cord. Basal ganglia does influence the motor cortex but it isn't part of the corticospinal tract, hence not an upper motor neuron lesion.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>3)\nRole of muscle spindles in spasticity from upper motor neuron lesions:<\/p>\n\n<p>I am using this website for this part of my answer:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.d.umn.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.d.umn.edu<\/a>\nit's from university of minnisota, which is funny because their acronym is UMN<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>high resistance to stretch occurs when the spindles are overactive\n  (usually due to high rate of gamma motor neuron discharge) -->\n  HYPERTONIC (SPASTIC) <\/p>\n  \n  <p>removing inhibitory inputs to the gamma motor\n  neurons increases their discharge rate, and increases spindle output<\/p>\n  \n  <p>this can happen when there is an UPPER MOTOR NEURON lesion<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that with an upper motor neuron lesion, the gamma motor neuron is uninhibited, thus the gamma fibers have a constitutively increased discharge rate and muscle spindles are overactive. The machanoreceptors in the spindles then decrease their afferent sign, which should lead to relaxation of a/g-motor neurons, and well, I dunno, I am thoroughly confused on the precise mechanism of UMN lesion causing spasticity. Reflexes are intact so the a/g-motor neurons should relax, since only UMN damaged and not any part of the reflex arc.

Gamma motor neurons control tone of muscle. \nIn decerebrate rigidity, the reticulospinal tracts are cut, so the gamma motor neurons start firing excessively, and SPASTICITY develops. I understood this part and why Decerebrate Rigidity is a misnomer as it is actually spasticity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Question is, in decorticate rigidity, the cerebral cortex is damaged. The basal ganglia are intact. One explanation I found is that the basal ganglia keep the reticulospinal tract activated so gamma motor neuron is under control. But if basal ganglia have no direct communication with brainstem or spinal cord, and their efferents pass through cerebral cortex, then even in decorticate rigidity, the reticulospinal tract should not be working, and thus the gamma motor neurons should fire excessively, in which case the decorticate rigidity also becomes a spasticity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Am I missing anything?

In terms of wiping other epigenetic marks during early embryogenesis, the only ones present would be the ones involved in gametogenesis.

McNeil Alexander, oscillatory movements in animals are limited by an organism's nature in general to minimize metabolic energy costs. The energy capacity, inertial, compliant, and dissipative forces involved in the muscles, tendons, skeleton, and non-actuating load all enter into this cost equation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strictly speaking these structures are very difficult to model with any degree of fidelity, and so are often approximated by simple mechanical lumped parameter systems of masses, springs and dashpots. From these simple systems, differential equations can be written, and the frequency that minimizes cost turns out to be the natural frequency - since at the natural frequency the system has the greatest ability to trap, store and re-use energy for the movement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Size and compliance are therefore the two parameters that matter most. Highest oscillatory speeds are able to occur in the smallest, stiffest muscles, assuming dissipative forces are small and input energy is available.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36685,"question_id":36222,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nMw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16866,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16866/theforestecologist","reputation":1908,"display_name":"theforestecologist","accept_rate":14},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1438963258,"creation_date":1438963258,"body":"<p>Our muscles are not limited to 7 hertz. <\/p>\n\n<p>You provide two examples yourself.

However, he notes that their study found that even wind speeds of 5mph instantly cooled the leaves via conductive heat transfer. Our study with spruce trees also found this to be true. Transpiration will further help the tree rid itself of that increased temperature fairly quickly. Regardless of these facts, radiant energy from leaves in the canopy will not be felt how-ever many meters below within its shadow. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, yes, transpiration can affect local climate, but this is only on the scale of whole forests.

As you can see from the table <a href=\"http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/fruit/intro.html\">here<\/a>, there is a distinct age after which the tree begins to decline. Now, that's not concrete (I've seen some apple trees last over 100 years (didn't plant those myself btw)), but generally, an apple tree will lose vigor and productivity before it reaches 50 years of age. This tree's 'immune system' also goes down, and it becomes susceptible to many diseases. You'll rarely see such a tree, as orchardists generally replace them rather fast.<\/p>\n\n<p>But to the point of your question. When you will graft an apple tree, you will generally bud graft it, as described <a href=\"http://www.garden.org/ediblelandscaping/?page=201008-how-to\">here<\/a>. That article (which is spot-on) says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Select a healthy branch of this year's growth from your desired variety of tree. Look for a plump leaf bud about halfway down the branch. Leaf buds are close to the branch where fruiting buds tend to stand out more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that it says nothing about the tree's age, simply stating that the wood must be healthy. That's because old wood/young wood produce the same result in the new trees. I was using a 40 year old <a href=\"http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/razor-russet\">razor russet<\/a> to graft onto all the <a href=\"http://www.appleman.ca/korchard/rootstok.htm\">Malling V<\/a> rootstocks I had for that variety. And of course they grew as expected, as a young sapling should. I've heard of a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109880276393197709042/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en\">nearby nursery<\/a> taking budwood from a 100 year old tree that still looked good. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can use a rootstock taken from an old plant, and also a scion from an old plant, and the new plant created will grow as a young sapling. Here's how the rootstocks I use are created: You cut down a tree at ground level, and it sends out a lot of shoots. You pile soil over it, but allow the ends of the shoots to stick through. These shoots will root into the soil, and can be cut at the base, and planted out for grafting later. This way, you can have 1000's of identical (cloned) rootstocks. You can also get rootstocks from old trees. <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AaSuf.jpg\">Here's<\/a> a diagram of the process. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>About herbaceous perennials, I've found (to some people's surprise) the same thing. The scion grows as a young plant again once grafted. I found this out because I graft heirloom tomatoes onto hybrid tomato rootstocks (the latter are seedlings). Usually, the scions will be from seedlings, but at times I take the scions from a large mature plant. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just so you know, an indeterminate tomato plant will, once mature, flower and fruit until frost. A determinate tomato variety will produce a large crop all at once, and then die back (this is the kind preferred by owners of mechanised (machine harvested) fields). <\/p>\n\n<p>In my tests, you could take the scion from an old determinate plant that was through fruiting, right before it started dying back, and successfully use that for grafting the new plants. These new plants' growth was identical to the growth of grafted plants whose scions came from seedlings, and they began to flower and produce fruit at the same time. Of course, actual seedlings did not have the vigor of the grafted plants, and were behind in growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Off-topic for your question, but possibly still of interest, I've found that <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Cuttings-from-Established-Plants\">cuttings<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.finegardening.com/making-more-shrubs\">layers<\/a> (not scions) taken from old plants (both woody and herbaceous), and rooted, would grow as young plants again. <\/p>\n","answer_id":28143,"question_id":23638,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1422666861}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23638/what-is-the-biological-age-of-grafted-plants","last_activity_date":1438946165,"creation_date":1414841861,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the biological age of grafted plants?","body":"<p>Suppose you graft a piece of an existing 'old' plant.

As you point out in the comment to Remi.b, contrasts are standardized by branch lengths (which are assumed to be proportional to \"evolutionary time\") before they are analysed (to obtain <em>standardized independent contrasts<\/em>). However, branch lengths can be come from a number of different sources (divergence times, genetic similarity etc), can be based on different evolutionary models, and can also be transformed (log etc). Therefore, you cannot say what the units of <em>standardized independent contrasts<\/em> are in general. They would probably not be dimensionless though, since branch lenghts are seldomly (if ever?) expressed in the same units as the raw contrasts. Units such as <em>log(kg)/year<\/em> or <em>kg/log(year)<\/em> are more likely. Ultimately, in the usual case, the point of standardizing is to assure that all contrasts receive equal weight in the the analysis, and the creation of suitable branch lengths can be a trial-and-error process, where you e.g. study the relationship between standardized contrasts and the standard deviation of contrasts to see if they have been adequately standardized. <\/p>\n\n<p>I guess you could describe the process as:  <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>calculate <strong>contrasts<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>calculate <strong>standardized contrasts<\/strong> (using branch lengths)<\/li>\n<li>when the contrasts are appropriately standardized, you have obtained <strong>phylogenetically independent contrasts<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of relevant quotes from <a href=\"http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/1/18.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garland et al., 1992<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...independent contrasts must be adequately standardized so that they will receive equal weighting in subsequent correlation or regression analyses. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>also<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Second, the statistical adequacy of any proposed branch lengths should be viewed as an empirical issue (cf. Grafen, 1989, 1992; Harvey and Pagel, 1991; Pagel and Harvey, 1992). Third, different transformations -\n  and indeed entirely different branch\n  lengths, based on different information -\n  can be used for different characters. The\n  use of different branch lengths for different characters would be analogous to using different transformations for the two variables in an ordinary correlation or regression.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>finally<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Standardized independent contrasts essentially indicate minimum average \"rates\" (or, in Bookstein's [1988] terminology, \"reduced speeds\") of character change occurring along two branches deriving from a\n  common ancestor (Garland, 1992).

Testing this is just a matter of statistics. Basically, to test for this, you run a linear model with the quantiative trait (eventually fitness) as the response variable and the environment, the genotype and their interaction as explainatory variables. If the interaction term is significant (and if the directionality of the interaction is the one you would expect, that is genotypes are more fit in the environment where they live and if each genotype outcompete the other in at least one environment), then the genotypes are locally adapted.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what counts as significant?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can chose the level of significance that you wish (0.05 for example).

In a given population, directional selection will ultimately reduce genetic variance (Natural Selection selects for a few variants letting the other variants disappear and therefore diminishing the genetic variance) while mutations bring variance back to the population on which further selection can occur.<\/p>\n\n<p>To go slightly further (but without developing this part too much): <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genetic drift<\/a> decrease genetic variance (on average). Balancing selection (such as negative frequency-dependent selection or spatially heterogeneous selection for examples) help to retain variation (but never create more variation) in comparison to what genetic drift alone would do. Different kind of spatial population structure also affect patterns of genetic variation. The important point to understand is that in an isolated population, mutation is the only process that can create new variants.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutations in multicellular organisms - Somatic vs Germaline mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You seem to call complex organism what we usually call multicellular organisms. You are very right that some mutations might be passed on while others won't.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you said, a mutation occurring in the left leg will never be found in you gametes. We call such mutations that can't be passed on <em>somatic mutations<\/em>. On the other hand, mutations that can be passed on are called <em>germline mutations<\/em>. Of course, in unicellular individuals, all mutations are germline mutations.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[..] aren't those already rare mutations only passed onto offspring if they occur in the short-lived sperm or egg cells of one of the parents<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Germline mutations are not only mutations that occur in the eggs or the spermatozoids (egg and spermatozoids are called <em>gametes<\/em>). <em>Germline mutations are any mutation within the lineage of the gametes<\/em>. For example a mutation that occur during a mitosis during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morula\" rel=\"nofollow\">morula<\/a> phase on the right cell is also a germline mutation. A mutation that occurs in the testis during the division of a cell <code>type Ad spermatogomium<\/code> to give rise to another <code>type Ad spermatogomium<\/code> and a <code>type Ap spermatogomium<\/code> is also a germline mutation (see figure at the bottom of this answer and see the <code>Age-specific mutation rate<\/code> section). There are therefore a tons of divisions during which germline mutations can occur in big multicellular organism, while (germline) mutations can occur during only the single cellular division in unicellular organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How many new mutations do humans passed on to their offsprings?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking the germline mutation rate per nucleotide is around $10^{-8} \\text{or } 10^{-9}$ but don't consider this value too much as the per nucleotide mutation rate varies a lot between species and especially between different genomic regions. FYI, the haploid human genome (just to consider an example) consists of about 3 billions ($3\\cdot 10^9$) base pairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The number of new mutations per offspring in humans is a Poisson distribution with mean and variance of about 100 mutations (this estimate might be quite inaccurate). This is maybe more mutations that you may have expected.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Age specific mutation rate<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are typically a lot of cellular divisions happening in the testes in order to produce the very important number of spermatozoids a male produces in his lifetime (See figure at the bottom of this answer and see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogonium\" rel=\"nofollow\">spermatogonium<\/a>). Mutations also occurs during those division and therefore we observe a correlation between the age of the father and the number of new mutations transmitted to the offspring. <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol85/iss4/1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hong et al. (2012)<\/a> suggest to use the following formula. The number of new mutations transmitted to the offspring by the father in humans is equal to $25 + 2(g-20)$, where $g$ is the age of the father. Of course this is just a formula that match quite well the observations but has no theoretical meaning. This formula applies only to males that are older than 20 years old.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Drake's rule<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Empirical observations show that the higher is the number of base pairs $n$, the lower is the per-base pair mutation rate $\\mu$. This correlation between $n$ and $\\mu$ is roughly linear with a slope of about 1. In other words, the genome-wide mutation rate $U = \\mu \\cdot n$ is more or less constant in all species. This correlation is referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_size#Drake.27s_rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drake's rule<\/a> and again, it is a rough approximation of a more complex reality.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>sexual reproduction vs asexual reproduction<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I am not exactly sure why you are talking about sexual reproduction in your post. Note that the mutation rate during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">meiosis<\/a> (process that occurs during sexual reproduction) is much higher than the mutation during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">mitosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutational effects<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The <em>mutation effect<\/em> is the effect of a given new germline mutation. Of course, not all mutations have the same effect and there is therefore a <em>distribution of mutational effects<\/em>. Most recent studies (often <em>mutation accumulation experiments<\/em>) tend to show that a highly skewed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">gamma distribution<\/a> (the negative exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution) is good fit to model the distribution of mutational effects of either beneficial or deleterious mutations. So the whole distribution of mutational effects are estimated to be best modeled by a gamma distribution for the beneficial mutations and a reversed gamma distribution for the deleterious mutations put side by side (where the density probability of having a perfectly neutral mutation is at the intersection of the two gamma distributions). The exact parameters for those distribution are likely to vary depending on the species but most likely depending on the exact stretch of DNA under consideration. Different papers offer different estimates (<a href=\"http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/pkeightl//\" rel=\"nofollow\">the work of P. Keightley<\/a> on the subject is particularly influential). The two gamma distributions need to be rescaled to make sure that the whole thing sum up to one and I don't know of any paper that suggest actual parameters for this rescaling.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Probability of fixation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Fixation<\/em> is the event of a given allele (=variant of a gene) to reach a frequency of 1 in the population. In other, one allele is fixed, whenever at the locus (=genomic region of arbitrary size) under consideration is not polymorphic anymore in the population. The probability of fixation of a given mutation is a very important statistics. Let's call $s$ the mutation effect (if $s&gt;0$, the mutation is beneficial). The probability of fixation of a neutral mutation given the population size is $P(s=0 | N) = \\frac{1}{2N}$ (assuming a diplontic life-cycle) as it can be demonstrated from Coalescent theory, Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift or Moran (birth-death) model. The probability of fixation of a beneficial mutation is higher, while the probability of fixation of a deleterious mutation is lower. Those probabilities can be estimated with different techniques that use different assumptions: Haldane's technic (assuming that the number of offspring follows a Poisson distribution), Kimura's technic (using diffusion equations), Birth-death models, etc... Some methods assume small values of $s$, some others assume that $2Ns &gt;&gt; 1$, etc..<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Number of new mutations in the population and rate of neutral substitution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If the genome-wide mutation rate for neutral mutations is $U_n$ and the population size is $N$, then there is a Poisson distribution of the number of new mutations at each generation with mean and variance $2 \\cdot U_n \\cdot N$ (assuming a diplontic life-cycle). Because each one of these mutation has a probability $\\frac{1}{2N}$ to get fixed, the rate of neutral substitution in this population is $\\frac{1}{2N}\\cdot 2 U_n N = U_n$. Therefore, the rate of neutral substitution is a function of the genome wide neutral mutation rate only. This classic result is used in estimating time since last divergence between sister lineages (molecular clock)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you say Mutation Theory?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have never heard of <em>Mutation Theory<\/em>.

That is, if you calculate a concentration based on the dry weight, the A<sub>340<\/sub> will be about 85% what you expect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if some water is absorbed from the atmosphere, this will make little difference as you are probably going to calculate the concentration based on\nthe A<sub>340<\/sub>. <\/p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15878/243\">User 243<\/a> has <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/36483/1136\">pointed out<\/a>, if you are concerned that the NAD(P)H is degraded or oxidized, then an A<sub>340<\/sub> \nmeasurement will probably set things right.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are concerned that all the A<sub>340<\/sub>  absorbing material is not NAD(P)H, or that a significant proportion is in the &alpha;-form (Oppenheimer &amp; Kaplan, 1975) or is otherwise enzymically inactive, the best thing is an enzymic calibration. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is done by adding limiting amounts of NAD(P)H to an assay system containing excess substrate and calibrating enzyme, and measuring the total decrease in absorbance (Racker, 1957).  <\/p>\n\n<p>A popular calibrating enzyme for NADH is aldehyde dehydrogenase (<a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC1/2/1/3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">EC 1.2.1.3<\/a>), as the reaction is practically irreversible, and it makes it easy to 'drive' the calibrating reaction to completing (and you don't have to worry about equilibria). <\/p>\n\n<p>As I said in a previous post, NAD(P)H is UNSTABLE IN ACID (Oppenheimer and Kaplan, 1974). To put it crudely, 'the head (nicotinamide moiety) falls off', causing a bleaching of the absorbance at 340nm.  Making 100mM acetate, pH 5, 100 micromolar in NAD(P)H produces a very significant decrease in A<sub>340<\/sub> absorbance with time (which may be very easily monitored in a spectrophotometer). <\/p>\n\n<p>Just because all the A<sub>340<\/sub> material is due to NAD(P)H, this does not necessarily mean that the commercial preparation is pure.  In fact, far from it.  Dalziel (1963) showed that commercial preparations of NADH then available contained a competitive inhibitor of many dehydrogenases, most probably adenosine diphosphate ribose. <\/p>\n\n<p>Accepting Dalziel's value of 17 600 M<sup>-1<\/sup>cm<sup>-1<\/sup> for the extinction coefficient for NADH at 260nm, and assuming that NADPH has an identical value, then highly purified samples of NAD(P)H should have an A<sub>260<\/sub>/A<sub>340<\/sub> ratio of about 2.83, and values <strong>higher<\/strong> than this may indicate the presence of impurities that absorb at 260nm, but not at 340nm. ADP-ribose is a prime example, but NAD(P)<sup>+<\/sup> is another possibility.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I notice that in one of the <a href=\"https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/2/n7505pis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">links<\/a> given by <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/aliced\">AliceD<\/a>, Sigma quote a A<sub>260<\/sub>/A<sub>340<\/sub> ratio of 2.32. So is the higher value due to the presence of residual NAD(P)<sup>+<\/sup>, or something else (a breakdown product?), or both? <\/p>\n\n<p>You may need to use chromatography, typically on an anion-exchange resin, to obtain NAD(P)H free of impurities. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Dalziel, K.

However, I skimmed the website and they mention 3 cm square sponges or 3.5 cm diameter circular sponges, which brings the upper limit to <strong>0.22<\/strong> and <strong>0.28 mA/cm<sup>2<\/sup><\/strong>, respectively. The website says the device can be used up to <a href=\"http://www.foc.us/index.php/v2-tdcs-developer-edition\" rel=\"nofollow\">40 min<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In all, based on this literature review on tDCS and despite the company claiming their <a href=\"http://www.foc.us/index.php/v2-tdcs-developer-edition\" rel=\"nofollow\">device is safe<\/a>, I would conclude the upper limit of <strong>2 mA not advisable<\/strong>, as its assciated current density exceeds the upper limits that I was able to find (Note, my answer is by no means a comprehensive review on safety of tDCS !). Dependent on the exact electrode surface you could calculate your own safety limit based upon the references cited.   <\/p>\n\n<p>(3) <strong>tDCS and enhanced focus<\/strong>: Health benefits in terms of ability to focus: I searched Google Scholar using the search term \"TransCranial Direct Current Stimulation attention\", which yielded no useful hits. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another way to go for your focus question is to look at what cortex is situated underneath the 'forehead' that is stimulated by this device. Basically it is the prefrontal cortex: \n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/LzVxY.png\" alt=\"pFC\">  <\/p>\n\n<p>Stimulating the prefrontal cortex reportedly increases <strong>working memory<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/docs/dnb/2005-fregni.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fregni et al., 2005<\/a>) and <strong>motor learning<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/10710628_Facilitation_of_implicit_motor_learning_by_weak_transcranial_direct_current_stimulation_of_the_primary_motor_cortex_in_the_human/file/79e4150ae2024da0f0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nitsche et al., 2003<\/a>). Working memory basically allows a person to use acquired information (let's say seconds or perhaps minutes ago) in subsequent tasks. Motor learning is essentially training of motor skills. Both motor learning and working memory are essential in gaming(!). However, one should carefully read the cited articles (and perhaps related ones, I gave just a few) in terms of effect size, electrode placement and stimulus conditions (including, but not limited to: current level, stimulus duration, stimulus waveforms, stimulus frequency, session duration etc.) to extrapolate their findings onto your device.      <\/p>\n","answer_id":26324,"question_id":26312,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1420205992}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26312/are-there-any-known-health-benefits-risks-from-milliampere-current-0-1-2-ma","last_activity_date":1438784313,"creation_date":1420067515,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any known health benefits / risks from milliampere current (0.1-2 mA) on forehead?","body":"<p>This is about devices like that sold by <a href=\"http://www.foc.us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">foc.us<\/a> that allows user to apply a small current on a specific part of the forehead.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the sake of this question I use the foc.us \"gamer\" model as example.

So it's difficult to distinguish 'nicotine stain' from a 'tar stain' based on visual inspection. Let's go to other considerations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of a 'stain' implies that simple hand washing doesn't remove the coloration. Since nicotine is water miscible, one would expect it's easily removed with soap and water. <strong>That implies that either a) a smoker's stain is <em>not<\/em> primarily nicotine, or b) the nicotine reacts with the skin to create the stain.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Nicotine is sufficiently functionalized that it could conceivably undergo some interesting chemical reactions with proteins, but I don't think that's what's happening. A simple observation is that transdermal nicotine patches do not contain a colored agent, and do not stain the skin. Score one point for the \"mostly tar\" explanation. Cigarette smoke contains far more tar than nicotine, and tar will deposit on most-any surface (at ambient temperatures), so <strong>it's parsimonious to proceed with the \"mostly tar\" explanation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The picture shows that the stain occurs on both fingernails and skin. The most abundant protein that's common to those two tissues is keratin. Like other examples of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue\" rel=\"nofollow\">protein staining<\/a>, the mechanism is complicated and poorly understood, but the basic outline is that parts of keratin are greasy (the non-polar amino acids) that associate with other greasy things.  (EDIT: AliceD's answer also depicts the well-known staining of teeth, which are not keratinized, showing that the staining mechanism is likely a nonspecific adsorption of greasy things onto surfaces.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The stain can be fixed through the involvement of free radicals and other reactive species in cigarette smoke, like formaldehyde. In this sense, reactive oxygen species are active participants. I don't think oxygen deprivation plays a role here. I don't think this can be described as a melanosis, as the skin isn't producing melanin in response to smoking but is simply being coated in tar.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Even if the stain was completely fixed, the coloring would fade away as the exterior skin cells are sloughed off, consistent with normal skin physiology.<\/strong> This is the explanation for the fading of any stained epidermis. The persistence of tar stains on teeth (which do not exfoliate) further evinces that the stain is removed through the replacement of skin cells.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36495,"question_id":36493,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1438375495},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":36504,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14a225b416674b1d9fb6cf14554d5054?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8709,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8709/boncodigo","reputation":289,"display_name":"bonCodigo","accept_rate":100},"edited":false,"creation_date":1438312225,"comment_id":60713,"body":"That added part is a bit vague - there are many inks.

(Well, OK, I'd love to evolve an extra pair of hands but that is not possible.) Natural selection works by modifying existing traits. Your turtle can stare all she wants at food out of reach but she will not evolve a longer neck. Instead, natural variation exists among neck lengths of the turtles because of variation of the genes that determine features related to overall boxy size. Those individuals with longer necks may be able to get a bit more food, live a little longer, and reproduce a little more. They will pass along their genes to their offspring, so perhaps more of their offspring will also have longer necks. Over many generations, the turtles may have somewhat longer necks. <\/p>\n\n<p>A common misconception is that the traits of organisms are precisely adapted for a specific need. They are not, for a few reasons. First, natural selection occurs relative to the current environment. Adaptations that work well in one environment may not be so useful in another environment. Environments are rarely stable over evolutionary time so traits are subject to constant change. <\/p>\n\n<p>Next, as mentioned above, natural selection can only work on what traits are present. While an extra set of arms would be handy, I am a tetrapod. My four appendages, along with the appendages of all other tetrapods, trace back to our common ancestor. The appendages of all tetrapods are modifications of that ancestral trait. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, organisms haven't \"sampled\" the entire realm of possible mutations and combinations of mutations. In other words, a certain mutation or set of mutations might actually be able to adaptively improve a particular trait in the current environment but, if the mutations never occur, then the improvement can never happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>We only need to look at ourselves to realize how imperfectly adapted we are. We get bad backs and knees because our bodies weren't designed to walk upright. We evolved from quadrupedal organisms. This has happened so recently that changes in the structure of our knees and backs haven't yet evolved (and may never).  Search the internet for the \"blind spot\" eye test. We have a mass of blood vessels in <em>front<\/em> of the retina of our eyes, which reduces our visual accuity. We often have to have teeth pulled from our jaws because the flattening of our face (relative to our australopithicine ancestors) has shorted our jaws. We don't have as much room for our teeth but we have not evolved a reduced number of teeth.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for human technology being able to make direct changes to our DNA to improve our adaptability, I would say no. While I do not have the ability to see into the future, the complexity of our genome, and more specifically how genes are regulated, suggests to me this would be a very daunting if not impossible task.  See the long answer below for more on regulatory genes but the gist is that a small set of regulatory genes control most of the other genes (including other regulatory genes). The interactions are extremely complex and we have a detailed understanding of very few of these interactions.  I speculate that affecting one such gene in a \"positive\" way is very likely to have many unintended negative consequences. <\/p>\n\n<p>Below is some simple math and other ideas to show you how mutations can lead to the many adaptive traits that you see among the diversity of life on earth.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Story<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>how can so many specific (advanced) evolutionary leaps be otherwise explained?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Mutations occur at random throughout the genome. Most mutations will be neutral. That is, they are neither bad or good from an evolutionary viewpoint. The mutations are neutral because the genome for most organisms is non-functional. Mutations that occur in the functional regions of DNA (i.e., protein-encoding and related regions) are more likely to be detrimental (bad) because the mutation may negatively affect the function of the protein or even the ability to produce the protein.  However, some mutations are beneficial. The mutation may actually enhance the functionality of the protein, or even produce new proteins.  <\/p>\n\n<p>A couple of factors have to be considered regsrding mutations.  The mutation <em>rate<\/em> is very low.  For example, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/99/2/803.long\">Kumar and Subramanian (2002)<\/a> compared the DNA sequences of 5669 protein-encoding genes from 326 species of mammals.  Their results suggested that the average mutation rate among mammals is 2.2 x 10$^{-9}$ per base pair (bp) per year.  This means that, on average, a point mutation has chagned each DNA nucleotide position in the mammalian genome slightly more than twice (2.2 times) every billion (10$^9$) years. That's a lot of time!<\/p>\n\n<p>However, this same rate occurs in every individual in the population, so you have to consider the population sizes of the organisms. So, let's do a simple exercise. Consider a species like the <a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/making-fittest-natural-selection-and-adaptation\">rock pocket mouse<\/a> or other small mammal that has a very short generation time. For this simple example, let's assume the generation time is one year. That means that the mutation rate of 2.2 x 10$^{-9}$ per bp per year would then correspond to 2.2 x 10$^{-9}$ mutations per bp per generation. Generation time is important because new mutations are inherited only through reproduction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assume the average mammalian diploid genome is about 6 billion (6 x 10$^9$) nucleotides in size. The number of heritable mutations that occur in a single offspring is<\/p>\n\n<p>$$(6 \\times 10^9) \\times (2.2 \\times 10^{-9}) = 13.2.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, assume that about 2.5% of the mammalian genome is composed of functional, transcribed sequences that may affect the phenotype (the traits of the organism). That means that, of all the mutations that occur in every offspring every generation, about 2.5% could potential affect the phenotype.  That is,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$13.2 \\times 0.025 = 0.33.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Still a small number.  But, now we have to account for population size. Small mammals, like mice and voles, generally have large population sizes.  Assume that the population of rock pocket mice contains 100,000 reproducing individuals. If so, then<\/p>\n\n<p>$$0.33 \\times 100,000 = 33,000,$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>which is the number of new heritable mutations that could occur in the population. Most of these mutations will be detrimental and removed from the population by natural selection but, if even a small fraction of these new mutations are beneficial, then natural selection can cause these beneficial mutations to increase rapidly in frequency in the population during future generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>In humans, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1461236/pdf/10978293.pdf\">Nachman and Crowell (2000)<\/a> estimated that the average mutation rate was 2.5 x 10$^{-8}$ mutations per bp per generation (not year), by comparing the genomes of humans and chimps. If we assume the same genome size and effective human population size of 500,000 individuals, then applying the same math suggests that 1,875,000 new mutations that potentially affect phenotype occur in the human population every generation. Again, only some of these will be beneficial but that is still the possibility of a number of new beneficial mutations. In evolutionary terms a mouse or human generation is the blink of an eye.<\/p>\n\n<p>How long would it take for a beneficial mutation to spread through a population? That depends on two things. How beneficial is the mutation (called the strength of selection, <em>s<\/em>) and the population size. To estimate how long it would take for a beneficial mutation to spread through a population, we can use the formula,<\/p>\n\n<p>$$t = \\frac{2}{s}\\mathrm{ln}(2N_e),$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $t$ is time in generations, $s$ is the strength of selection, and $N_e$ is the effective population size (number of reproducing individuals). For strength of selection, let's assume $s=0.01$, which is weak but positive natural selection. Going back to our rock pocket mice with $N_e = 100,000$, then the beneficial mutation would be spread throughout the population in only 2441 generations (remember, we're talking evolutonary time so 2000 years is nothing). If $N_e = 10,000$, the the mutation spreads in only 1981 generations.  If we increase the strength of selection t 0.2, then the times are 122 and 99 years for population sizes of 100,000 and 10,000 years, respectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>These \"back of the napkin\" calculations show just how quickly even weakly beneficial mutations can appear and spread throughout a population. Yet, this doesn't include other types of mutations like gene duplications that can also allow new proteins to evolve. For example, human ability to see red colors is due to a simple gene duplication <a href=\"http://cichlid.umd.edu/cichlidlabs/kc/Teaching/Visionpdfs/Nathans1986.pdf\">(Nathans et al. 1996<\/a> and references therein). This duplication also explains the common form of red-green colorblindness.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Whew!<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>There's yet more to our mutational story. Consider humans and chimps, which are nearly identical from a genetic standpoint (between 96-99% depending on how you calculate it) yet they appear very different.  If humans and chimps diverged from their common ancestor within the past five million years, how could they differ so much? This question was initially posted by [King and Wilson (1975)]. They argued that mutations to structural proteins (like those that compose bones and muscles) would not be enough to explain the phenotype differences between humans and chimps. The proposed that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topic/gene-expression-and-regulation-15\">regulatory genes<\/a> are the key to understanding the big differences. Regulatory genes are those that control other genes, by turning them on or off and other important functions. Changes to the regulatory genes can cause fairly rapid changes to the phenotype.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This understanding has led to the broad (and fascinating) field of <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evodevo_01\">evolutionary developmental biology<\/a>. This field focuses on how mutations in regulatory genes associated with development (from embryo to adult) have had a long-term evolutionary impact. The field is rich with examples, but one cool one is associated with duck feet and bat wings. Let's begin with the embryo. Most vertebrate embryos have membranes between the digits (fingers and toes) during an early stage of development. For most vertebrates, the membranes are lost later in development. The small flaps of skin you have between your fingers are the remanants of your embryonic membranes. <\/p>\n\n<p>A set of regulatory genes called BMPs (and a couple of others) are responsible for causing the loss of the membrane in vertebrates. However, through different sets of mutations, the BMPs are not able to function in duck feet and bat hands. Thus, they both end up with membranes between between their digits (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/103/41/15103.long\">Weatherbee et al. 2006<\/a>).  Thus, two different mutations block the same set of developmental genes, leading to novel adaptations in two very different types of vertebrates. One final example is the evolution of bird feathers from scales. As you may know, birds are evolved from dinosaurs. It turns out that bird feathers and alligator scales (alligators are birds closest <em>living<\/em> relative) use the same regulatory genes to develop. The genes are BMP2 and SHH (sonic hedgehog for fans of the old computer game) (<a href=\"http://prumlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/harris_etal_2002.pdf\">Harris et al. 2002<\/a>). Other regulatory genes underlie the different types of feathers, like downy feathers and flight feathers (Harris et al. 2002).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature Cited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Harris, M.P. et al. 2002. <em>Shh-Bmp2<\/em> Signaling module and the evolutionary origin and diversification of feathers.

This list I think already shows some point you misunderstood about evolution. The Lewontin recipe is a good way in order to understand what is natural selection and when it occurs. The Lewontin recipe says that natural selection occurs whenever:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Individuals in a population varies in terms of a given trait<\/li>\n<li>This trait has some (additive) heritability. <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16576/can-i-force-evolution-in-a-group-of-cells-by-removing-all-the-smaller-cells/16578#16578\">Here<\/a> is one of the several posts that explain the concept of heritability. It might be slightly a post that is a bit advanced for you though but shortly speaking it means that offspring are more similar to their parents more than they are to other non-kin individuals in the population.<\/li>\n<li>The fitness varies (not necessarily linearly) as the trait varies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Simple example:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In a population, there are blue pens and red pens<\/li>\n<li>Reproduction is asexual and blue pens create other blue pens while red pens create other red pens.<\/li>\n<li>blue pens make more offspring than red pens.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In such situation natural selection occurs yielding the frequency of the blue pens to increase in the population while the frequency of red pens will decrease.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is evolution?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is not only natural selection. It is for example very important to consider random events. One of them is <em>mutation<\/em>, another is <em>genetic drift<\/em> (I am not trying to list every parameters that influence evolution but only to give you a sense of why natural selection is different than evolution with a goal of explaining why a trait that is needed do not necessarily appear). Both mutations and genetic drift explain why a species will not necessarily be perfectly adapted to its environment.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Mutations<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In the broad sense mutation is any change in the DNA sequence. Some changes are more likely to happen that other but in any case the likeliness of these changes to happen is not dependent on the consequence they will have on the phenotype (shortly speaking, phenotype is how an individual looks like) and on the reproductive success. So mutations occur randomly and the specific mutation that would be needed in the population may not occur. Therefore saying, if a trait is needed (in the sense of \"if a trait would be beneficial\"), then a mutation will occur to make this trait existing is totally wrong. You may be surprised by the level of adaptation of life but this does not mean that what they needed was created with the purpose to help these individuals surviving but it only means that random mutations occur, most of them are deleterious (decrease the reproductive success) while few of them are beneficial (increase the reproductive success) and those that are beneficial are more likely to raise in frequency in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Genetic drift<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>If the change in frequency of mutations would depend exclusively on natural selection, then I would not have said before that a beneficial mutation is more likely to raise in frequency but I would have said that a beneficial mutation will raise in frequency. An intuitive explanation of what is genetic drift can be found on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si/14545#14545\">this post<\/a>. It will also allow you to understand why small population undergo more random change in frequency of their genes than are big population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when you say that you noticed that <code>Any time a species has needed the development of a specific feature to survive, it has developed that feature, and that feature precisely<\/code> is wrong. You only noticed that species has some level of adaptiveness if I can say so. It is very hard to imagine what new mutation would be beneficial of a given individual in a population but there are in reality many mutations that are beneficial that has never occurred or that has disappeared because of genetic drift. Also, as it is implied in the Lewtontin recipe different individuals have different traits yielding to different reproductive success. If you do not consider mutations that has never occurred but only to sites in the genome that are polymorphic (where different variants exist in the population), then it is worth knowing that any single individual carry quite a lot of deleterious variants. These deleterious mutations explain many genetic disease. No, we are not perfect.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About your question again<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps a bit.

There are many vestigial features from previous generations which persist, even though they are no longer needed. Notice that flatfish hatch with eyes on opposite sides of their head and one eye then migrates to be on the same side as the other, and whale embryos that have teeth which have disappeared by the time they are born, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural selection is a combination of lucky mutations which happen to fit in with the prevailing conditions.<\/strong> It's a tough world out there. Even the plants are strangling each other, as can be seen on this video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNjR4rVA8to\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNjR4rVA8to<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The turtle didn't have much time to stare longingly at the leaves he couldn't reach.<\/strong> Some other turtle with a slightly longer neck came and and ate them. And he got bigger and stronger, and fought with the first turtle so he got to mate with all the females. And so the next generation of turtles had longer necks than the last. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>It's easy to forget, with our comfortable lives, what a struggle nature is. The reason for this is that humans as a species have developed the most devastating weapon of all: cooperation.<\/strong> Compared to most other organisms, we treat other individuals of the same species pretty well (most of the time) <em>and<\/em> we actually <strong>teach<\/strong> each other how to do things. While some other species cooperate among individuals, humans have taken this to a whole new level. As a result we have been able to eradicate many species which pose a threat to us, and bring many other species which are useful to us under control. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>If you want to know why this didn`t happen before:<\/strong> humans evolved from an ape-like creature that, due to changes in its environment, came down out of the trees and started walking on the ground. This creature then had its hands free to use tools, and by sheer chance this combination of factors made a bigger brain advantageous, so this creature (which was already social, like apes but unlike octopi, one of the few other creatures blessed with the ability to perform complex manipulations) became even more intelligent and began to educate its offspring in how to control its environment. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>There is nothing in biology which enables the mutation of genes to be directed. Finally, human technology has developed to the point where it may be possible to modify genes directly.<\/strong> However there are significant ethical issues regarding the use of this technology. The termination of an \"imperfect\" human is frowned upon, because it is considered that all members of the species should be given the best chance to survive. Besides, <strong>it is not at all clear if there is really ever such thing as a \"defective\" gene.<\/strong> For example carriers of the gene responsible for sickle cell anaemia have increased resistance to malaria.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <strong>long before humans were able to manipulate genes directly, they were able to produce massive changes in the phenotype of dogs in a remarkably small number of generations.<\/strong> There is a breed of dog adapted to every possible use. An unfortunate consequence is that <strong>the gene pool in each breed is rather small, leading to breed-specific illneses.<\/strong> If these breeds were left alone it would take many generations for mutations to allow their genotypes to diversify again.

What there is, is a way of mixing and matching genes, so that the best ones can propagate throughout the population.<\/strong> Unicellular organisms do this by a variety of means. <strong>For multicellular organisms the way of doing is sexual reproduction.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The cost of this is enormous.<\/strong> Look at a flowering plant. That flower has evolved exclusively to enable pollination, typically by insects. In some cases, virtually all the plant's energy goes into making that flower, and relatively little into making the actual seeds. Plants do have a particular problem exchanging genes, because they do not move about. Stationary animals, such as the barnacle, also have similar problems. The barnacle solves this by having a \"penis\" several times longer than its body length, so that it can copulate with its neighbour without moving from its spot. In humans, fully half the population is male and therefore unable to bear offspring. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Asexual reproduction is far more efficient at producing offspring, but does not enable the interchange of genes.

In many large herbivorous mammals this is done by males fighting. Male birds often display their health by elaborate plumage, the classic example being the peacock. It is debatable whether such a conspicuous waste of resources is really beneficial to the species, but the females have evolved to select males in this way. In some fish, there is only one male in a group, and when something happens to him, the biggest heathiest female actually changes sex to become a male.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So, if an organism were able to program its own genes, why invest so much energy in sexual reproduction?<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":20918,"question_id":20912,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1409572245},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7F3Q8.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9049,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9049/franmowinckel","reputation":131,"display_name":"FranMowinckel"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1409590462,"creation_date":1409590462,"body":"<p>The answer provided by Mike Taylor is just perfect and complete. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I'd like to add some thoughts of my own in a more colloquial style:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Survival of the fittest is not always true.

And indeed, it has succesfully been applied to a number of fields (see below the quote), which seems to imply that evolution is not a property of the evolving individuals (as you implied) but <strong>a property of the system<\/strong> where the individuals evolve (as long as the individuals satisfy a few special properties, namely variation and heredity, see below).<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the definition from Wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the most fundamental level, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution states that organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by an iterative process. This process can be conceived as an evolutionary algorithm that searches the space of possible forms (the fitness landscape) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>variation of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by mutation or recombination.<\/li>\n  <li>selection of the fittest variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.<\/li>\n  <li>heredity or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  \n  <p>After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the iteration. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of trial-and-error or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The generalization made in \"universal\" Darwinism is to replace \"organism\" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can \"survive\" (maintain, be retained) long enough or \"reproduce\" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there is a selective \"preference\" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce \"better\" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are genes, ideas (memes), neurons and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, antibodies, institutions, quantum states and even whole universes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, you may be interested by some terminology associated with this theory, for example for John Maynard Smith an individual that can evolve in an evolvable system is called a <em>Unit of evolution<\/em>[1].

Lamarck postulated that given the use of tissues altered those tissues e.g. lifting weights makes muscles bigger, then an organisms descendants would benefit if everything the parent's tissues \"learned\" could be passed on. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are actually epigenetic factors in cells that selectively turn genes on or off or otherwise modify their use generation to generation.

Going forward, if the plants it does eat goes away, how would it ever find another food source? It wouldn't desire to eat inedible plants so it would never exert itself to do so and would never pass that exertion on to it's young.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The hiccup in your understanding of darwinism is that you've got it backwards. Species don't finds solutions and evolve. It's not something species do. It's something that <strong><em>happens<\/em><\/strong> to species, a force from the outside. It's not analogous to humans setting down to consciously solve a problem. <\/p>\n\n<p>Darwin was originally going to use the analogy of \"wedging\" instead of \"natural selection.\" He wanted to emphasize that it was the environment squeezing in on species that formed them. (Today we think of wedges largely for their splittly power but in but in Darwin's day, if you wanted to compress something you used a wedge hammered in from the side. It was a common tool that performed the same jobs as jacks and hydraulics do today.) But he went with the anthropomorphic analogy of nature being an animal breeder selecting for traits for reproductive success and a lot of misunderstandings followed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is not random. Only variations themselves are random. The selection of them is not. It's like shooting dice. The fall of the dice is random but only certain values of dice are winning number and are \"selected.\" The same mutation might show up in every generation for millions of years but produce no change until environment changes to make the mutation useful. <\/p>\n\n<p>Species have no existence independent form their environment. The environment squeezes them into a specific form, one that best statifies the demands of the Second Law of thermodynamics. If the environment doesn't change, then the organism won't either. From that perspective adaptation is about as amazing an rock rolling down hill.

Walking one way you pass a blank stretch of clay. After you pass, a leaf falls into the claw, and creates a near perfect imprint before being blown away.

The clay did not alter to fit the leaf, the force of the falling leaf altered the clay. <\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise, species do not evolve themselves, they are evolved by external forces. Species seem to miraculous fit their ecological niches but, just like the clay, did nothing to shape themselves to the niche. Just as the will be be passively shaped by pressure of molding, species have no choice but to assume the forms they do. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's not survival of the <em>fittist<\/em> but survival of the <strong><em>fitted<\/em><\/strong>.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":21855,"question_id":20912,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bczpO.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8952/comprehensible","reputation":186,"display_name":"comprehensible"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":36635,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438764955,"comment_id":61059,"body":"Can you please add some references to your answer?"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1438765818,"creation_date":1438764720,"body":"<p>There are indeed massive evolutionary control systems integrated into DNA.

Changes in bone length vary more than 10 percent in a single generation of humans, but changes like lactose tolerance occur only every 100ds of generations. Therefore there are hundreds of genes for controlling growth hormones as it's selection-important. If color changes become important to an animal, for example birds, fish, and butterflies, then hundreds of genes are devoted to color. If color is not important, for example northern and snow animals, then few gene changes are devoted to color, The many Color genes of a tropical animal would go dormant very fast if it were exposed to snowy conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>It makes sense for DNA to favor developments that encourage reproduction and survival in variable settings, and indeed DNA is supercharged to deliver mostly useful morphological and chemical changes in large numbers. Plants, conversely, need to change their chemicals alot to attract and repel animals, whereas animals do not need to attract other animals for food, only to defend themselves, that one reason why animals have a lot less chemical variety than plants. Only Chinese use animals for medicine, and there are few aspirins and sedatives derived from animals. Animals cannot produce powerful random chemicals because their nervous system hormones and cell walls are less robust than cellulose cells and plant hormones. Otherwise animals would have more variable smell and taste, but all mammals taste similar.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's the same with computer evolution.

If you equip a computer evolution program with DNA tool kits copied from nature, you will much faster have meaningful animals... i.e. simple locomotive insects.

I'll try to blend them all together as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all evolution did not choose to make us love sports. Evolution made us social animals. And sports is just one of the tools we use for that purpose. Think about it, because if evolution gave us sports, then you will play sports, your kids will inherit that bit of experience from you and they would be that much better than you. But no, we all start from level 0 when we try to play any games or sports. This is because, sports is primarily a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">motor memory<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So why are we social?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n1/abs/nn.3594.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">study<\/a> back in 2014 was one of the first to suggest that memory can be heritable. It generated a lot of attention and the authors themselves suggested that their findings were standing on a very capricious footing and required further validation. <\/p>\n\n<p>This point is valid because evolutionary forces require mechanisms by which features/mechanism which bestow advantages towards the survival of the species are positively reinforced. In this case social behaviour is the function. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do not go googling the word Social behaviour, for some reason the wiki article looks only at dogs and cats.

The only real biological information that is important for\n  labeling strands is the location of the 5' phosphate group and the 3'\n  hydroxyl group because these ends determine the direction of\n  transcription and translation. A sequence 5' CGCTAT 3' is equivalent\n  to a sequence written 3' TATCGC 5' as long as the 5' and 3' ends are\n  noted. If the ends are not labeled, convention is to assume that the\n  sequence is written in the 5' to 3' direction. Watson strand refers to\n  5' to 3' top strand (5' → 3'), whereas Crick strand refers to 5' to 3'\n  bottom strand (3' ← 5').[4] Both Watson and Crick strands can be\n  either sense or antisense strands depending on the gene whose\n  sequences are displayed in the genome sequence database. For example,\n  YEL021W, an alias of URA3 gene used in NCBI database, defines that\n  this gene is located on the 21st open reading frame (ORF) from the\n  centromere of the left arm (L) of Yeast (Y) chromosome number V (E),\n  and that the expression coding strand is Watson strand (W). YKL074C\n  defines the 74th ORF to the left of the centromere of chromosome XI\n  and denotes coding strand from the Crick strand (C). Another confusing\n  term referring to \"Plus\" and \"Minus\" strand is also widely used.\n  Whatever the strand is a sense (positive) or antisense (negative), the\n  default query sequence in NCBI BLAST alignment is \"Plus\" strand.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Although it is correct when it says <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Watson = Sense = Plus Strands<\/li>\n<li>Crick = Antisense = Negative Strands<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>A satisfactory answer/convention is provided/suggested in this PMC article covering <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055211/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the terminology of the Watson and Crick strands<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Below are some interesting excerpts from the publication:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The earliest reference that we could find to the \"Watson strand\" and\n  the \"Crick strand\" is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and comes from a pair\n  of papers in 1967 by Wacław Szybalski and colleagues. They\n  bound the two DNA strands of phage λ to the synthetic polynucleotide,\n  poly(IG), which has an affinity to cytosine-rich regions. They then\n  separated the two strands by density, which turned out to be\n  determined by the amount of bound poly(IG). In a cesium-chloride\n  density gradient, the strand with more bound poly(IG) was denser and\n  heavier than its complement. Because the \"dense\" strand was\n  cytosine-rich, Szybalski and colleagues called it the \"C strand.\"\n  Logically, thus, the complementary strand, which was guanine rich,\n  should have been the \"G strand.\" Instead, it was christened the \"W\n  strand.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So the authors note that the Strands started on their terminology journey with their roles reversed with the Crick strand specifying the heavy strand (with IG) and the Watson strand specifying the lighter one.<\/p>\n\n<p>They also note that the present day terminology of the WC model is non-arbitratrily based on the current horizontal drawing convention where one strand is placed on top and the other at the bottom.<\/p>\n\n<p>They also suggested a typical convention which is followed today. If it was due to their suggestion is a different matter altogether, but beyond the scope of this question.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given the amount of effort already spent on standardizing such\n  databases, and their influence on other disciplines, we feel that the\n  genomic definition of Watson and Crick strands has the most mass\n  behind it. Specifically, we find that the unambiguous usage of the\n  Saccharomyces Genome Database to be the most useful. Under the first\n  part of our proposal, the centromere is a reference point that divides\n  a chromosome into two arms of unequal length. The chromosome is\n  oriented so that shorter arm is on the left and the longer arm on the\n  right. Furthermore, the top strand has its 5'-end at the left\n  (short-arm) telomere and its 3'-end at the right (long-arm) telomere.\n  This strand is the Watson strand. Similarly, the bottom strand has its\n  5'-end at the right telomere and its 3' at the left telomere and is\n  the Crick strand. We further propose that \"top\", \"forward\", and \"plus\"\n  be used as synonyms for the Watson strand and \"bottom\", \"reverse\", and\n  \"minus\" for the Crick strand.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and later on...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If it is ultimately impossible to distinguish Watson and Crick strands\n  using biological properties, then we propose that Watson should refer\n  to the stand arbitrarily used as a reference in a database (i.e. the\n  \"plus\" stand) and the Crick strand should refer to its complement<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But let's come to sequencing data or FASTQ files. When we align reads, a resulting SAM or BAM file has a column specifying strand information, we usually see a + or - strand. <\/p>\n\n<p>Which suggests that the product originated from either the Watson (positive) or the Crick (negative) strands. For example, a read is actually the reverse complement of the product, but since you do a PCR step during you library preparation, that particular bit of information is lost and therefore the downstream analysis protocols tend to consider the entire loci any single product aligns to.<\/p>\n\n<p>The difference between strand specific sequencing and non-strand specific sequencing are covered <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1958/difference-between-strand-specific-and-not-strand-specific-rna-seq-data\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36596,"question_id":36595,"up_vote_count":2,"community_owned_date":1438630132,"last_edit_date":1438630499}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36595/what-is-the-strand-specificity-of-a-reference-genome","last_activity_date":1438632326,"creation_date":1438601839,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the strand specificity of a reference genome?","body":"<p>It's a simple question but I've come across many people who have this question, is the reference genome Positive of Negative strand?

Smaller molecules of drugs can use solute carrier transporter (SLC), whereas bigger molecules (oligo- and polymeres) would use the receptor-mediated transporter (RMT).<\/p>\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090205174546.htm\">a nice article<\/a> on this topic published by ScienceDaily.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is the quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One technology for enabling active transport of small molecule drugs\n  across the BBB involves targeting endogenous nutrient transporters.\n  These transporters are members of the solute carrier (SLC) transporter\n  superfamily. Transport of small molecules across the BBB by these\n  membrane proteins is known as carrier-mediated transport (CMT).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In order to design drugs that utilize CMT to cross the BBB,\n  researchers modify their chemical structures so that they resemble\n  nutrients that are transported across the BBB by specific SLCs. The\n  prototypical drug that uses this strategy (which was developed long\n  before mechanisms of CMT were known) is L-DOPA, the major current drug\n  for Parkinson's disease. L-DOPA is used to replace dopamine that is\n  lost due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia\n  nigra of the brain.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Another major system that is used in normal mammalian physiology to\n  enable needed molecules to cross the BBB is receptor-mediated\n  transport (RMT). The brain uses RMT to transport proteins, peptides,\n  and lipoproteins that are needed for brain function across the BBB.\n  Examples of biomolecules that are transported into the brain via RMT\n  include insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), leptin,\n  transferrin, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In RMT, molecules in the circulation may bind to specific receptors on\n  the luminal surface of brain capillaries (i.e., the surface that\n  interfaces with the bloodstream). Upon binding, the receptor-ligand\n  complex is internalized into the endothelial cell by a process called\n  receptor-mediated endocytosis. The ligand may then be transported\n  across the abluminal membrane of the endothelial cell (i.e., the\n  membrane that interfaces with brain tissue) into the brain.
