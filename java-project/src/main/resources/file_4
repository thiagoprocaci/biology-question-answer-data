Period. Teens really need to know that.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think you may have your terms confused - semen is the overall fluid released during an ejaculation, sperm are the cells with tails that are produced in the testes and fertilize the egg. At any rate, according to the WHO, a normal sperm count is over 15 million per milliliter, with some counts much higher (>50e6/ml ), and an average between 20 and 40 million. The volume of the ejeculate tends to be anywhere from 1-6 ml. If you take a healthy young male at the peak of his reproductive capabilities, this equates to a very large number of sperm being released during a sexual encounter. All it takes is for one to reach an egg and fertilize it. Sperm are very very small, much smaller than the pore size of average fabric, so clothing will do very little to stop them. The female is likely sexually aroused during this activity as well, and produces additional fluids and lubricants that promote the survival and motility of sperm, among other things.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, it depends on many factors. If both parties are fully clothed (at least 4 layers of clothing between their respective reproductive organs) and there is a minumum of soaking through, the chances of pregnancy are correspondingly quite low. On the other hand, if only one partner is wearing just their underwear, it's essentially like there is no clothing present at all, and the relative chances go up significantly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Safe sex practices can't be emphasized enough to young people, as education and awareness is so much better than ignorance and myths. Even aside from pregnancy, if condoms are not utilized properly to contain all the semen there is the chance of sexually-transmitted diseases, ranging from herpes and gonorrhea to AIDS. None of these require penetration to be passed along, and one might argue that the additional presence of potentially irritating fabrics could open up raw areas or cuts and enhance their transmittal.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Take home message<\/h2>\n\n<p>Now, all this being said, the chances of impregnation through clothing without direct penetration of the penis into the vagina is quite low compared to \"typical\" unprotected fully-penetrating intercourse, especially depending on where the female is in her fertility cycle. According to <a href=\"http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol3/5/default.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this study<\/a>, a woman's most fertile day is two days before ovulation (as had been postulated before), and the chances of pregnancy on that day are about 25% (assuming penetrating intercourse). Overall, the chance of pregnancy throughout the month is about 5%. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don't have any hard numbers on the pregnancy chances when one or both partners have at least some clothing on, as obviously it will vary greatly depending on who is wearing what, the volume of ejaculate, contact time after ejaculation, etc. Just for fun, let's assume it's 100 times lower. That means the chances of impregnation two days pre-ovulation would be 0.25%, or 1 in 400. While rather low, this is still a non-zero chance. <\/p>\n\n<p>Condoms are about 98% effective if used properly during penetrative vaginal intercourse. Various other birth control methods such as contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective on their own, although they do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. I'm certainly not one for preaching abstinence, but done properly it should be 100% effective. Ultimately, it is up to both partners to decide what their risk tolerances are, together. It is much better to seriously talk about it beforehand than to be panicked and unsure afterwards.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Hopefully this addresses your concerns, please leave comments if you have additional questions.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20036,"question_id":20034,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1456167233},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PdtwV.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22033,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22033/forest","reputation":878,"display_name":"Forest"},"score":-2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":2,"last_activity_date":1461181913,"creation_date":1456170677,"body":"<p>It is effectively impossible to get pregnant by <a href=\"http://beforeplay.org/2014/01/can-sperm-go-through-clothes-and-get-a-woman-pregnant/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dry-humping<\/a> because the conditions that would have to be met for sperm to pass through multiple layers of clothes, survive on skin, find the vaginal opening, survive in the vaginal environment and finally impregnate an egg are simply unrealistic. <\/p>\n\n<p>The barrier of clothing that we can assume present during 'dry humping' is significant.

You will have to sit down and spend a couple of hours on the topic \u2014 all you can expect from a site like this is clarification of key points.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said I'll offer some clarification. The first thing I'll say is that focusing on chemical equations is not the way to understand photosynthesis. It will demonstrate that the law of conservation of matter applies, but otherwise is a bit like doing a chemical analysis of a cell to try to understand how it works. This is because:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are two quite separate reactions in photosynthesis. As the products of one are (more strictly can be) used in the second, overall equations cancel them out, and so ignore key features of the process.<\/li>\n<li>Photosynthesis is concerned with the transformation of energy as much as molecular structure. Chemical equations do not really address this.<\/li>\n<li>The generation of energy involves the establishment of a gradient of hydrogen ions across a biological membrane \u2014 something your chemical equation does not encompass.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So what are the key ideas to bring to the text book you are going to purchase?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The overall objective is to make sugar from carbon dioxide<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This poses a problem, not particularly because of the chemical reactions, but because these reactions require energy of two kinds:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To join the carbons from the carbon dioxide into C-C bonds. This requires ATP, the free energy change of its hydrolysis to ADP being coupled to \u2018drive\u2019 the formation of a C-C bond.<\/li>\n<li>To reduce the oxygen atoms of carbon dioxide to OH groups. The biochemical molecule that is used for this reduction is NADPH, so \u2018energy\u2019 is needed to reduce its oxidized form, NADP<sup>+<\/sup>. (I won\u2019t go into why this can be thought of as energy \u2014 if interested you need to read about the free energy equivalents of redox couples.) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>The sun provides the energy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The energy for creating the reducing NADPH and the ATP comes from the sun in a complex series of reactions (these do not involve carbon dioxide).

At the same time an equally complex process builds up a H<sup>+<\/sup> concentration difference across a membrane which provides the energy to convert ADP to ATP (see also <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35632/where-do-the-h-ions-come-from-in-light-reactions/45396#45396\">Where do the H+ ions come from in light reactions?<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>This is what is called the light reaction of photosynthesis because it requires light.

However, these and countless other examples\n  show that it is usually easy to recognize: a new feature that endows\n  its bearer with qualitatively new, often game changing abilities.\n  These may not only mean the difference between life and death in a\n  given environment (just think of biosynthetic abilities), they may\n  also create broad platforms for future innovations, as did innovations\n  of photosynthesis and of complex nervous systems.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However the examples he cites in the introduction are not as obvious as he says. Lets say the evolution of nervous system. The <em>innovation<\/em> that would have led to evolution of nervous system could have been the evolution of electrically excitable cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Actually, throughout the introduction he does not actually clarify the meaning of innovation.

Novel selection can occur through two principle routes: acting on standing genetic variation or novel mutations. In the case of standing genetic variation, variants exist in a population and then the adaptive landscape changes, introducing selection (fitness differences) between the variants. In the case of novel mutations, there is a standing potential for fitness differences but there is no genetic variation underlying the trait, until a mutation arises. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Side note: examples of how standing genetic variation and novel mutation affect adaptation<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine that there is standing genetic variation for heat tolerance, but this variation is outside the normal range of temperatures (allele 1 allows tolerance of up to 30 C, allele 2 allows tolerance of up to 40 C, but the environment never exceeds 20 C). There may then be a shift in the environment which means that it sometimes exceeds 30 C. This means selection suddenly acts on the previously neutral standing genetic variation. It is not a new idea that previously neutral genetic variation can come under selection.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Alternatively, a pre-existing neutral allele can drift to intermediate frequency and can later become advantageous when selection pressures change owing to environmental change or to colonization of a new habitat.\"<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Conversely, imagine that higher sperm motility would increase reproductive output, but there is no genetic variance for sperm motility. In this case there is no selection on sperm motility (selection occurs only when there is genetic covariance with fitness), but if a novel mutation arises which does affect sperm motility, suddenly we have selection. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>What Wagner's idea <em>does<\/em> suggest<\/strong> is that, because genes act in interacting networks (see epistasis), previously neutral standing genetic variation can be brought in to play for selection. If novel mutations arise in one gene that allow standing genetic variation in another interacting gene to affect fitness then selection acts on both loci. It's not so much a problem he is dealing with, just an additional idea of <em>how<\/em> genetic variation can accumulate in populations and allow rapid adaptation.

This happens during the light dependent stage of photosynthesis, (there is also a second light-independent stage called the Calvin cycle, and that is where the CO$_2$ is used), I won't go into detail about what the protons and electrons do (unless you want me to) but you need to know that these come from a water molecule, the water is split using light (photolysis, literally: cutting with light) into two hydrogens and half an oxygen molecule (or an oxygen atom). The oxygen that was released in photolysis is not required for the rest of the pathway, so it diffuses out of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>For why it doesn't come from carbon dioxide, you need to consider the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is converted to glucose by enzymes, using products from the light dependent stage, so 6CO$_2$ are combined over six cycles to form one molecule of glucose. So that is where the CO$_2$ is used as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hope that helped!

This requires \u2018reducing power\u2019 (in the form of the NADPH) which also requires energy input.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>The sun solves the problem by supplying the energy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The energy for creating the reducing NADPH and the ATP comes from the sun in a complex series of reactions that do <em>not<\/em> involve carbon dioxide. Light of a particular wavelength is used to break a water bond so as to separate charge in a reaction that I will deliberately not balance:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) H<sub>2<\/sub>O → O<sub>2<\/sub> + H<\/p>\n\n<p>A complex series of reactions transfer the H (more strictly an electron) between different molecules, eventually reducing NADP<sup>+<\/sup> to NADPH. At the same time an equally complex process builds up a H<sup>+<\/sup> concentration difference across a membrane which provides the energy to convert ADP to ATP.<\/p>\n\n<p>To reiterate, the reaction uses light energy to generate chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. Oxygen is just flushed down the toilet.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now for the Lego bricks \u2014 so easy we can do it in the dark<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Having harvested the energy of the sun we have money in the bank which we can spend whenever we want \u2014 day or night \u2014 to make sugar from carbon dioxide. The overall unbalanced equation is:<\/p>\n\n<p>(2) CO<sub>2<\/sub> + NADPH + ATP → C<sub>6<\/sub>H<sub>12<\/sub>O<sub>6<\/sub> + NADP<sup>+<\/sup> + ADP<\/p>\n\n<p>but this is actually a complex series of enzyme-catalysed reactions (known as the Calvin Cycle if you must know).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>You still want to know the answer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The oxygen produced in photosynthesis comes from water because this is the molecule in which a bond is broken by sunlight to separate charge allowing synthesis of molecules with reducing power and energy transfer potential. Carbon dioxide is the building block of the sugar and far from breaking a C=O bond, what is needed is for it to be reduced to C-OH.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45337,"question_id":17940,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1461105871}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17940/why-does-the-oxygen-produced-in-the-photosynthesis-come-from-water-and-not-co-2","last_activity_date":1461105871,"creation_date":1402049586,"answer_count":4,"title":"Why does the oxygen produced in the photosynthesis come from water and not CO$_2$?","body":"<p>In the photosynthesis equation<\/p>\n\n<p>$$6*CO_2+6*H_2O+sunlight\\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6*O_2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>the only place where we have 6 molecules of $O_2$ is in the $6*CO_2$.

There are some published comparisons of different search providers (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/22/2/338.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falagas et al. 2008<\/a>, <a href=\"http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/55/5/578.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anders &amp; Evans 2010<\/a>, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3163%2F1536-5050.95.4.442\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schultz 2007<\/a>) but t<strong>he main difference in practice unless you are at a major university is that PubMed, Google Scholar and EuropePMC are all free, while Scopus and WoS are subscription-only<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other major differences include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PubMed is designed for biomedical use, although in my experience\ncoverage of other areas of the life sciences is acceptable. There are\ntutorials on using PubMed <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmed.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Google Scholar includes a lot of 'grey literature' which is not\npeer-reviewed, which could be an advantage or a disadvantage. I tend\nto steer clear of it unless I am specifically interested in the grey\nliterature.<\/li>\n<li>Scopus and Web of Science (previously Web of Knowledge) are\nsubscription service operated by Elsevier and Thomson Reuters\nrespectively. Both integrate additional article metric functionality \nfor example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">H-index<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">impact factor<\/a>, although it\ndoesn't sound like you would need these. I find Scopus slightly\neasier to use and a few comparative studies suggest its coverage is\nslightly more complete but there's not much to choose between them.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, the 'new kid on the block' is EuropePMC which seems to be\nvery similar to PubMed but apparently indexes substantially more articles\nthan PubMed. It also has some nifty functionality such as searching\nby grants, linking to ORCIDs etc. It allows search automation via\nsoftware packages which is very useful for systematic reviews etc\n(others may also do this but if so I haven't found it yet).

However there are several reasons that this may not cause their removal or trigger an immune response. These include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Location. If the food is in the stomach I imagine that the digestive environment favours breakdown to sugars, amino acids etc and exposure to antibodies is minimal.<\/li>\n<li>Chemistry. Certain substances such as fat, nucleic acids, are weakly antigenic.<\/li>\n<li>Size. Small molecules are not immunogenic unless attached to a larger one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Why are small molecules not immunogenic?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think this is probably the key point here, so I'll expand on it a little in general terms. <\/p>\n\n<p>If an antibody binds a foreign protein, this is large enough that other antibody molecules can bind it too. And the antibody is bivalent, so it may bind a second foreign protein. This leads to a cross-linked matrix that can be recognized by macrophages and engulfed. If a small molecule binds to an antibody this cannot happen and the molecule may well diffuse off again.<\/p>\n\n<p>As well as binding those soluble antibodies (IgG) already present, antigens cause the antibody-producing cells (B-cells) to divide to produce more of the particular antibody. This happens because the B-cells have a membrane bound variant (IgM) with the same specificity on their surface. When a molecule binds to <em>two<\/em> of these membrane antibodies a signal is triggered to the cell. This can happen with a large molecule, but a small molecule can bind only one IgM on the surface and this expansion of antibody-producing cells will not happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>This size requirement for immunogenicity can be understood in the context of the size of the bacteria and viruses which one presumes the immune system evolved to combat.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>More Information<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, I deliberately answering the question in general terms.

An example would be unrelated species such as <em>Myrmarachne plataleoides<\/em>, the spider, and the weaver ant <em>Oecophylla smaragdina<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given that evolution is a random process that doesn't have any pre-defined targets the probability of such convergence in evolutionary history should be nearly zero. My argument is that the search space for a 'nearly optimal' Batesian mimic would be too large and hence any search algorithm would be unable to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Even the sampler, which would\nneed to sample from a wide variety of valid phenotypes in the parameter space would run into serious problems. <\/p>\n\n<p>The problem of the curse of dimensionality for optimal sampling can be intuitively explained in the following way: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Let's say you have a straight line 100 yards long and you dropped a penny somewhere on it. It wouldn't be too hard to find. You walk along the line and it takes two minutes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Now let's say you have a square 100 yards on each side and you dropped a penny somewhere on it. It would be pretty hard, like searching across two football fields stuck together. It could take days.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Now a cube 100 yards across. That's like searching a 30-story building the size of a football stadium.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The difficulty of searching through the space gets a lot harder as you have more dimensions.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Here are additional points to clarify what I mean:<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is whether the Batesian mimic would need to initially be quite similar in morphology to the different species that it's converging to in morphology. In mathematical terms, if the parameter space for the visible morphological features is $(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ then convergence is probable if and only if the initial condition lies in a small enough neighborhood of the solution $(q_1,...,q_n)$. <\/p>\n\n<p>One of the features of the fitness function is that I think there should be exponential payoffs in terms of reproductive success near the solution $\\vec{q}$. Further, I think there are probably other very important environmental factors that might lead to such convergence. An arboreal jumping spider of similar size that shares the same environment as leaf-cutter ants is a good example. They would already have similar color among other features in order to blend in the same environment. <\/p>\n","question_id":45338,"tags":["evolution","mimicry"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":45374,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1461076277},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100003301550273/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":5700,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5700/user4147","reputation":856,"display_name":"user4147","accept_rate":56},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":17591,"edited":false,"creation_date":1400865136,"comment_id":24096,"body":"I edited your question so people might find it easier to answer.  hope that&#39;s okay - feel free to re-edit."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae45fae3b9f94cb427d2b83c0ba5f23c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6830,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6830/user46243","reputation":1,"display_name":"user46243"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":17620,"edited":false,"creation_date":1401173787,"comment_id":24232,"body":"U haven&#39;t answered the last two questions, from where does the basal membrane originate and does it regenerate from a different layer of cells."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1400933948,"creation_date":1400933948,"body":"<p>The Basal Membrane is regenerated by a different layer of cells.\nNot replaced by the skin layer below\nif your epidermis and squamous was shed and the skin below would replace it that layer would soon shed and after a while your skin would have been shed down to your muscle!\nIf you want to do a small experiment to see what happens to your epidermis when it is broken try biting the skin of the end of your fingers,\nThen see what happends. <\/p>\n","answer_id":17620,"question_id":17591,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08613e0b782cdf2bb8f2501cae9bdc5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":806,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/806/armatus","reputation":5317,"display_name":"Armatus","accept_rate":81},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1401106667,"creation_date":1401058625,"body":"<p>The epidermis is a four- or five-layered epithelium.

But, with a second-degree burn, most (or at least some) skin accessory organs typically remain in tact.  Remember, these accessory organs (like glands and hairs) are built from invaginations of the epidermis, creating the epithelium of the glands or hair follicles.

Importantly, only small, relatively hydrophobic molecules are able to diffuse across a phospholipid bilayer at significant rates (Figure 12.15). Thus, gases (such as O<sub>2<\/sub> and CO<sub>2<\/sub>), hydrophobic molecules (such as benzene), and small polar but uncharged molecules (such as H<sub>2<\/sub>O and ethanol) are able to diffuse across the plasma membrane. Other biological molecules, however, are unable to dissolve in the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer. Consequently, larger uncharged polar molecules such as glucose are unable to cross the plasma membrane by passive diffusion, as are charged molecules of any size (including small ions such as H<sup>+<\/sup>, Na<sup>+<\/sup>, K<sup>+<\/sup>, and Cl<sup>-<\/sup>). The passage of these molecules across the membrane instead requires the activity of specific transport and channel proteins, which therefore control the traffic of most biological molecules into and out of the cell.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/agHjI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/agHjI.jpg\" alt=\"Passive diffusion\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As shown in above paragraph, molecules have to dissolve in phospholipid bilayer to diffuse through it. But since the hydrophilic part is already interacting with water, so dissolving is mainly for the hydrophobic part.

Thus, small gases like O<sub>2<\/sub>, CO<sub>2<\/sub> and non-polar molecules like benzene easily dissolve in hydrophobic part and diffuse through it. Also, molecules like water and ethanol can also dissolve in it in small amounts due to their small size and very less polarity.

See this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Structure<\/a><\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n  \n  <p>An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA. This results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove. A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.<\/p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>RNAses are very common.  Most critically, in biological systems, the presence of dsRNA is a signal of viruses and active transposable elements, so ssRNA is an easy way for the host cell to distinguish foreign elements.  Yes, that was an oversimplification and ignored functional dsRNA, but even then, dsRNA likely evolved from systems to foreign elements.<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why is DNA double stranded (and not single stranded like RNA)?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I would refer to <a href=\"http://medicguide.blogspot.in/2008/07/why-is-dna-double-stranded-but-rna.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://medicguide.blogspot.in/2008/07/why-is-dna-double-stranded-but-rna.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, the 'information' part of DNA is the nitrogenous base, as opposed to the pentose sugar or the phosphate residues. In a single-stranded molecule, this important part would be exposed to the cellular environment, providing more opportunity for it to be mutated by the various chemicals there. In a double-stranded configuration, however, the two nitrogenous bases are locked within the complex, facing each other in the centre of the molecule. This organisation helps to safeguard them from local mutagens.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Secondly, having two complementary strands facing each other fundamentally means having two copies of the same thing placed right next to each other. This allows for proof-reading. George C. Williams summarised this beautifully in this pithy passage** (recall that adenine [A] on one strand should always bind to a thymine [T] on the complementary strand, and visa versa; likewise cytosine [C] always binds to guanine [G], and vice versa)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hBqtJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hBqtJ.png\" alt=\"structure of DNA from Wikipedia\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is the difference between DNA and RNA?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.diffen.com/difference/DNA_vs_RNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.diffen.com/difference/DNA_vs_RNA<\/a> gives a complete difference chart between the two and also gives this image:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/61mZW.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/61mZW.png\" alt=\"DNA vs RNA\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How are roles of DNA and RNA different?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Again from <a href=\"http://www.diffen.com/difference/DNA_vs_RNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.diffen.com/difference/DNA_vs_RNA<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RNA has several different functions that, though all interconnected, vary slightly depending on the type. There are three main types of RNA:<\/p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribes genetic information from the DNA found in a cell's nucleus, and then carries this information to the cell's cytoplasm and ribosome.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Transfer RNA (tRNA) is found in a cell's cytoplasm and is closely related to mRNA as its helper. tRNA literally transfers amino acids, the core components of proteins, to the mRNA in a ribosome.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is found in a cell's cytoplasm.

Besides what is mentioned in the other answers, you also need to add species that <strong>shift their trophic role over their life history<\/strong>, which is e.g. the case for many species of fish, where juveniles are primary consumers (of e.g. plancton), while adults are secondary or tertiary consumers. The same situation is found in frogs (tadpoles vs adults) and many other organism groups. The basis for these shifts is often a change in body size (so trophic position is partially a function of body size), and these shifts are often discussed under the label <strong>ontogenetic niche shifts<\/strong> (see <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002141?journalCode=ecolsys.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Werner &amp; Gilliam, 1984<\/a>).

First of all, male and female humans have <em>exactly<\/em> the same reproductive rate. For obvious reasons, every time a male has offspring, a female must have had also. Last I checked neither male nor female humans are capable of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">parthenogenesis<\/a> (certain popular religious beliefs notwithstanding).<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, let's assume that the 2.5 number is correct. That would be the <em>average<\/em> number of children per couple. That does not mean that all couples will have 2.5, or even that <em>most<\/em> couples will have 2.5. It just means that the <em>average<\/em> will be 2.5. If, for example you have one couple with 6 children, one with 2 and two with 1, the average will be (6+2+1+1)/(1+1+2)= 2.5. <\/p>\n\n<p>On to the main point. What does selection mean? In its simplest form, that the individual most likely to survive (the famous \"fittest\") is also most likely to reproduce. This is a very simple concept, the longer you live the higher your chances of managing to have offspring. If you die two weeks after birth it is going to be hard to manage to reproduce yourself. This has not changed. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, what does \"fitness\" mean? It can mean many things. If you are a warm blooded creature at the beginning of an ice age for example, it could mean being better at regulating your temperature than your peers. If you are a 21st century human, it could mean being funnier on twitter than your peers. The two are not fundamentally different. They can both be selected for or against. As long as one mate is chosen over another, selection is happening and the \"fittest\" (in each particular context) is most often selected. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Add in the process of culturally modified selection pressure, and it\n  seems to me that even an \"unfit\" male would end up having a couple of\n  offspring. The fittest male (or female) is no better off than his or\n  her contemporaries because of this \"leveling\" effect.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Culturally modified selection pressure\", as you call it, is still selection pressure. Cultural factors can change what it means to be \"the fittest\" but there is no objective gold standard of \"fitness\". While it may be true that in modern human society, different characteristics are selected for than was the case with early <em>Homo sapiens<\/em>, this does not mean that \"evolution is not occurring\". On the contrary, it is occurring but perhaps it is moving in a new direction. In fact, this is essentially a circular argument. By definition, \"fittest\" means most likely to survive and reproduce. It does not mean strongest or fastest or prettiest. It just means whoever is better at reproducing. If that happens to be those individuals who are best at square dancing, then it is they who are the fittest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take the example of a modern human with diabetes. Medicine allows diabetics to lead fully productive and largely normal lives. So, perhaps diabetes is no longer a selective criterion. This does not mean that the diabetic cannot be selected for or against based on their fitness on other scales. <\/p>\n\n<p>Whatever the selective pressure, whatever it may be that defines a \"good mate\", if selection is present then so is evolution. The only way to remove a species from the process of selection would be to have <em>all<\/em> (or none) individuals of each and every generation reproducing at the same rate. This is clearly not the case with humans. Surely not everyone around you has, or will have, children? There you go, selection!<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<\/p>\n\n<p>In answer to your comment, yes indeed, in order for a selective pressure to make itself felt and affect phenotype (at the species level), it needs to be constant across several generations. However, even the absence of selective pressure affects evolution. As others have mentioned below, active selection is not the only mechanism of evolution. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your main question however seems to be the following: If modern society (medicine etc) allows individuals that would not survive in the wild to reproduce, how does that affect evolution? The main points in my answer, and all others here, are:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Even if we accept that modern humans have removed themselves from the purely \"biological fitness\"-based selection pressure (an assumption I am not at all sure is true), and assuming that this removal is constant enough over many generations (again unclear), even if all this is true, evolution is most certainly still occurring. It may even be faster since genotypes that would not survive in the wild persist in the gene pool, thereby increasing its diversity.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>As you point out in your comment below, for such social pressure to make itself felt, it needs to be constant across many generations. We are probably not there yet.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Most importantly, as I said above, <strong>there is no such thing as an absolute biological fitness<\/strong>. When the ecosystem changes, so does the definition of fitness. Modern humanity's ecosystem, our habitat, is intimately connected with our culture and society. If an individual is better at reproducing in that context, then that individual <em>is<\/em> more fit. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":5008,"question_id":5007,"up_vote_count":27,"last_edit_date":1461054121},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1453135697,"creation_date":1351501894,"body":"<p>Darwin used the term \u201c<em>descent with modification<\/em>\u201d to describe evolution.

Let me give you an example.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before cattle were domesticated over 99% of all adults were lactose-INtolerant (i.e., they did not produce the enzyme needed to break down lactose (lactase) and could not digest it, i.e. got diarrhoea if they drank milk). All infants produce this enzyme, but in lactose-intolerant people the gene that codes the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose becomes suppressed after the age of 1 or so. Before domestication of cattle, lactose-intolerant people were by far the majority in any human population. Why? Because if you never consume milk, constantly producing an unneeded enzyme is a huge waste of protein, especially in conditions of limited food supply. With the domestication of cattle, people who could utilize lactose suddenly had a huge advantage - they had another source of protein and calcium. They quickly became bigger and stronger than people who could not consume dairy products in adulthood. Thus, people in Europe and Africa (where cattle were domesticated) quickly became lactose-tolerant, unlike people in Asia, where to this day most people are lactose-intolerant. The evolutionary pressure at that time was huge - people in Europe and Africa went from mostly lactose-intolerant to mostly lactose-tolerant in 10 000 years or so. Interestingly enough, in this respect cats evolved in parallel to humans and now cats in Europe are predominantly lactose-tolerant, whereas cats in Asia are mostly lactose-intolerant. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is not the only change that has occurred within the last 10 000 years and it surely is not the last one that will take place. It is just an illustrative (and hopefully interesting) example of evolution and natural selection in modern humans.

In brief, a phenotypic trait is any trait that an individual is made of! <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Quantitative trait<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A quantitative trait is any trait that you can measure and ordinate, that is any trait that you can measure with numbers. For example height is a quantitative trait as you can say that individual <code>A<\/code> is taller than individual <code>B<\/code> which is itself taller that individual <code>C<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Variance of a quantitative trait<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In a population, different individuals can have different values for a given phenotypic trait $x$. Because, we are talking about quantitative traits we can calculate the variance of the trait in the population. Let's call this variance $V_P$ such as<\/p>\n\n<p>$$V_P=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i (x_i - \\bar x)^2$$<\/p>\n\n<p>In the above equation $x_i$ is the value of the phenotypic trait $x$ of individual $i$. $N$ is the population size (there are $N$ individuals in the population) and $\\bar x$ is the average phenotypic trait $x$ in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\bar x = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i x_i$$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is causing phenotypic variance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Why would a population display any phenotypic variance? Why wouldn't we just look exactly asame? What explain these differences?<\/p>\n\n<p>For some trait, we see very little variance. To consider the example the OP gave in the post, the number of arms in the human population shows very little variance. However, there is quite a bit of variance in terms of the number of IQ, in terms of height or of weight.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two (main) sources of variance that are underlying this phenotypic variance. The first one if the genetic variance and the second one is the environmental variance. We will call the genetic variance $V_G$ and the environment variance $V_E$.<\/p>\n\n<p>If, in a population people vary a lot in terms of how many hamburger they eat, then there is a non negligible $V_E$ underlying the phenotypic variance $V_P$ for weight. If in a population, there is a lot of variation of genes affecting weight, then there is a non negligible $V_E$ underlying the phenotypic variance $V_P$ for weight.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, a gene (or other non-coding sequence) that is polymorphic (=has more than 1 allele in the population) and which explains some of the variance in the phenotypic quantitative trait is called a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL). A locus is a sequence (of any length) on the genome. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Math reminder<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Variances of uncorrelated variables can simply be added! For simplicity we will assume for the moment that we are considering uncorrelated variables. As a consequence, we can express the phenotypic variance $V_P$ as a sum of the phenotypic variance that is due to environmental variance $V_E$ and the phenotypic variance that is due to genetic variance $V_G$<\/p>\n\n<p>$$V_P=V_E+V_G$$<\/p>\n\n<p>This equation is slightly simplified and this will affect the below calculations. See the section <em>Other sources of phenotypic variance<\/em> for more info.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can now talk about heritability!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Heritability in the broad sense<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Heritability in the broad sense $h_B$ is defined as the fraction of phenotypic variance $V_P$ that is explained by genetic variance $V_G$. In equation, it gives<\/p>\n\n<p>$$h_B=\\frac{V_G}{V_P} = \\frac{V_G}{V_E+V_G}$$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Heritability in the narrow sense<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Heritability in the narrow sense $h_N$ makes one further trick. We have to consider that the genetic variance $V_G$ that is underlying the phenotypic variance can itself be decomposed into a sum of variances. The variances that we like to consider the the <em>additive genetic variance<\/em> $V_{G,A}$ and the <em>dominance genetic variance<\/em> $V_{G,D}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>The additive genetic variance is the genetic variance that is due to additive interaction between alleles. The dominance genetic variance is due to non-additive interactions between allele.<\/p>\n\n<p>is defined as the fraction of phenotypic variance $V_P$ that is explained by genetic variance $V_G$. In equation, it gives<\/p>\n\n<p>We can now define the heritability in the narrow sense $h_N$ as the is defined as the fraction of phenotypic variance $V_P$ that is explained by the additive genetic variance $V_{G,A}$. In equation, it gives<\/p>\n\n<p>$$h_N=\\frac{V_{G,A}}{V_P} = \\frac{V_{G,A}}{V_E+V_G} = \\frac{V_{G,A}}{V_E+V_{G,A}+V_{G,D}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>In the special case, when all the genetic variance $V_G$ is exclusively done through additive interactions, then $V_{G,D} = 0$ and $V_{G,A}=V_G$ and therefore $h_N=h_B$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Interpretation of the heritability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If all of the phenotypic variance is due to genetic causes (and regardless of whether there is a lot or a little variance), then $h_B=1$. If all of the phenotypic variance if due to environment variance, then $h_B=0$.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>So what does a $h_B=0.3$ means?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It means that 30% of the phenotypic variance is explained by genetic variance and that 70% of the phenotypic variance is due to environmental variance.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what if there is no phenotypic variance in the population? if $V_P=0$, then the heritability is undefined (as dividing by zero is undefined). However, in general, we tend to think that there is always a tiny bit of environmental variance and most people would just go on saying that heritability is 0 when $V_P=0$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What will affect the heritability?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A measure of heritability is true for one population, in one environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you change the population, add a few mutation for example, you might well create a polymorphic locus that is causing some phenotypic variance. If you put the same population in another environment, you could suddenly have more or less phenotypic variation due to environmental variance. Typically, if you measure heritability in the lab in a controlled and constant environment, then you will likely overestimate the heritability (as you underestimate $V_e$) compared to the same population that is living in a very heterogeneous environment.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What heritability is not!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If a trait has low heritability, it does NOT mean that it is (or is not) an adaptation. It only means that there is no genetic variance that explains the phenotypic variance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we care about heritability?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If there is no genetic variance for a trait, it means that the only way this trait can change through time is by changing the environment (or by creating a non-zero genetic variance through mutations). If there is a non-zero genetic variance and if there is a different in fitness between individuals having different trait value then, the trait is under natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most commonly used index of heritability in the heritability in the narrow sense $h_N. $Why do we care about $h_N$?<\/p>\n\n<p>Let $\\bar x_t$ be the mean phenotypic value of the trait $x$ at time $t$. One generation later, that is at time $t+1$, the mean phenotypic value is $\\bar x_{t+1}$. Let's define the response of selection $R$ as the expected difference between these two quantities, that $R=E[\\bar x_{t+1} - \\bar x_t]$. Let's define the strength of selection $S$ and the heritability in the narrow sense $h_N$, then <\/p>\n\n<p>$$R=h_N \\cdot S$$<\/p>\n\n<p>As a consequence knowing $h_N$ allows us to predict the effect of selection on a given trait.<\/p>\n\n<p>This equation is called the breeder's equation (see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16806/how-to-interpret-the-breeders-equation\">this post<\/a> about its interpretation).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other sources of phenotypic variance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Saying $V_P=V_G+V_E$ is a little too simplistic. In reality there are other sources of phenotypic variation such as variance due to epigenetic changes $V_I$ and variance due to developmental noise $V_{DN}$ for example. It is also sometimes very important to consider the covariance between any pair of such variance. So, the equation would more correct if stated as<\/p>\n\n<p>$$V_P = V_G + V_E + V_I + V_{DN} + COV(V_G, V_E) + COV(V_G, V_I) + COV(V_G, V_{DN}) + COV(V_E, V_I) + COV(V_E, V_{DN}) + COV(V_I, V_{DN})$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that everyone is free to further decompose any of the above variance into a sum of variances as we did above for the genetic variance. For example the environmental variance $V_E$ could be decomposed into the sum of the phenotypic variance due to variance in temperature $V_T$ and the phenotypic variance due to variance in precipitation $V_{\\text{precipitation}}$ assuming the other types of environmental variances are negligible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42280,"question_id":42273,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1461004028},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456697120,"creation_date":1453122446,"body":"<p>Briefly, because remi.b gives a lot of good detail about this in his answer, (narrow sense) heritability is essentially a measure of how much of the phenotypic variance is explained by (additive) genetic variance.

A 2% efficiency increase in a market no one has yet tapped is still a huge advantage.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In this scenario because the first thing to use light was using green light it left a niche for another form of life to exploit. That niche would have been absorbtion of the Red and Blue spectrums. Which is the same area plants absorb today. They got so good at their niche that they eventually were able to generate much more energy than the first life form did and eventually out competed for the sun. This niche has worked so well that they never developed a full system for the other spectrums.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Because you could say that good enough is good enough:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sun puts out a lot of energy. It is possible that there was no need to try and capture all of the spectrum or that it was actually not beneficial to do so. Often too much sun is more an issue than too little. Too much sun and heat can dry out the plant. It is possible that to gain the benefits of photosynthesis there needed to be a reduction in some energy to balance it out. Much like a black car on a hot summer day a black plant might absorb all of the spectrums but also get far too hot. Blue plus red may just be the sweet spot.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>However, about your question about colour:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wouldn't plants get more energy if they absorbed light in the green area of the spectrum instead of the red one?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Plants would probably get more energy if their leaves were black. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sources:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-did-chlorophyl-evolve-to-be-green-as-opposed-to-black-which-would-absorb-more-energy\">https://www.quora.com/Why-did-chlorophyl-evolve-to-be-green-as-opposed-to-black-which-would-absorb-more-energy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691134/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691134/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807594/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807594/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":45335,"question_id":45333,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45333/why-is-chlorophyll-green-isnt-there-a-more-energetically-favorable-color","last_activity_date":1461003625,"creation_date":1460994251,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is chlorophyll green?

Two situations he discusses may be of interest.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is that large animals are not just scaled-up versions of smaller ones. He calculates the weight-bearing ability of bones to show that the increase in cross-section of bone in a scaled-up person could not accommodate the increase in \"weight per square inch\". The conclusion here, I think, is that a different type of structure is required to deal with the weight of a larger animal. In the sort of molecular genetic terms that did not then exist, one would need a different program of transcription.<\/p>\n\n<p>A second situation relates to the size of eyes and the size and number of rods and cones they contain. Here he argues that there is little intrinsic difference between the cells that make up the eyes of mice and men (this is 1926), despite the difference in number (and hence eye size). In this case the gene transcription would be expected to be similar.<\/p>\n\n<p>He also talks about the modification of lungs and gut to provide a required increase in surface area in larger animals. This would seem similar to the case you raise. Is this more of the same or a fundamental difference?

Clustal doesn't provide the options of setting the sort of restraints you would like. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is difficult to program and the authors of Clustal have been refining their algorithm for years. If it were perfect and completely robust they might be in a position to add more user tweaking, but at the moment you're stuck with those provided. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Comparison matrices and forcing alignments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It may be worth while to mention how one can force particular correspondences in simpler pairwise alignments. This involves manipulation of the comparison matrix used to score the comparison. DNA comparison matrices may be very simple, scoring, say, 1 for a perfect AA, TT, GG, CC match and 0 for any mismatch. Protein comparison matrices are more complex, with the values for perfect matches dependent on rarity and unique function (e.g. In the PAM250 substitution matrix WW scores 17, whereas GG scores only 5) and the values for mismatches also varying markedly (e.g. ED scores 4, compared with 5 for EE; but EW scores \u20137). There are various matrices available, so implementations of the Smith Waterman and Needleman and Wunsch pairwise comparison algorithms generally allow you to specify your own.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose you have biological information (not intrinsic in the algorithm) that makes you wish to force an alignment. For example, AAATAA sequences near the polyA tail of two mRNA 3'UTRs should align, but sometimes do not because other stretches of As give better scores. What you can do is replace the AAATAA by AAAZAA in each case, and then modify the scoring matrix so that ZZ scores very highly (e.g. 20) compared with AA. This will force the alignment, after which you can change the Zs back to Ts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Multiple Sequence Alignments tend to to use position-specific dynamic scoring matrices. As the overall sequences align, the original scoring system is adjusted to reflect the frequency found at a particular position. (For example if a position is skewed to E in 90% if cases, EE will score more than at a position in which E is found only in 20% of cases). <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying it would not be possible to change the initial Clustal matrix with Zs at a particular position, but I don't think this possibility is provided. (Anyway your situation is more complex.) Glancing at the Clustal Omega paper, I see that they allow, indeed encourage, you to build up alignments from previous profiles. If you managed to force the alignments of a few sequences and input the profile derived from that, you might get what you want.

Uterine endometrium depends on\n  extrinsic sex steroid input and hence likely has mechanisms that\n  enable adaptation to hormonal variation. Emerging evidence suggests\n  that sex steroid bioavailability in the endometrium is determined by\n  adjusting their metabolic rate and fate via regulation of cytochrome\n  (CYP) p450 enzymes. The CYP enzymes are targeted by ubiquitously\n  expressed Sp/Krüppel-like (Sp/KLF) transcription factors.\n  Specifically, KLF11 is highly expressed in reproductive tissues,\n  regulates an array of endocrine/metabolic pathways via epigenetic\n  histone-based mechanisms and, when aberrantly expressed, is associated\n  with diabetes and reproductive tract diseases, such as leiomyoma and\n  endometriosis. Using KLF11 as a model to investigate epigenetic\n  regulation of endometrial first-pass metabolism, we evaluated the\n  expression of a comprehensive array of metabolic enzymes in Ishikawa\n  cells. KLF11 repressed most endometrial CYP enzymes. To characterize\n  KLF11-recruited epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, we focused on the\n  estrogen-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4. KLF11 expression declined in\n  secretory phase endometrial epithelium associated with increased\n  CYP3A4 expression. Additionally, KLF11 bound to CYP3A4 promoter GC\n  elements and thereby repressed promoter, message, protein as well as\n  enzymatic function. This repression was epigenetically mediated,\n  because KLF11 colocalized with and recruited the corepressor\n  SIN3A/histone deacetylase resulting in selective deacetylation of the\n  CYP3A4 promoter. Repression was reversed by a mutation in KLF11 that\n  abrogated cofactor recruitment and binding. This repression was also\n  pharmacologically reversible with an histone deacetylase inhibitor.\n  Pharmacological alteration of endometrial metabolism could have\n  long-term translational implications on human reproduction and uterine\n  disease.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Citation:<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Zheng Y, Tabbaa ZM, Khan Z, Schoolmeester JK, El-Nashar S, Famuyide A, et al.

The only Stack Exchange question/answer on CPPs also points to a discussion of N-terminal fusion of CPPs to a cargo peptide:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5721/position-of-cell-penetrating-peptide\">position of cell penetrating peptide<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>However, research on cell penetrating peptides has come a long way since the 2005 article referenced in that post:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576229/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576229/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>There has been a dramatic increase in the number of different classes of cell penetrating peptides, including hydrophobic CPPs, primary amphipathic CPPs, alpha-helical amphipathic CPPs, beta sheet amphipathic CPPs, and proline-rich CPPs, among others:<\/p>\n\n<p>Milletti, F. (2012). Review: Cell-penetrating peptides: classes, origin, and current landscape. Drug Discovery Today, 17850-860. doi:10.1016/j.drudis.2012.03.002<\/p>\n\n<p>And that is just between 2005 and 2012! I have not been able to find a review of similar detail written in 2015, although I'm sure much progress has been made in the field. Although it is not my main question, I would appreciate any citations for more recent reviews which go into detail on the molecular mechanism of cell penetration for one or more classes of CPPs - especially a review of the function of PTDs in their native proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question:<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is whether the previously described postively charged CPPs and/or the new classes of CPPs described in Milletti 2012 are only functional as N-terminal fusions, or whether they typically function efficiently when they are incorporated within an internal loop (in terms of primary sequence, but still exposed to the solvent). The 2005 article cited in the previous Stack Exchange question on this topic stated that the CPP derived from HIV-1 Tat is based on residues 47-57, which are internal residues of the 86 amino acid protein - a protein which has cell-penetrating activity in its native role in HIV-1 infection:<\/p>\n\n<p>Vivès, E., Brodin, P., &amp; Lebleu, B. (1997). A truncated HIV-1 Tat protein basic domain rapidly translocates through the plasma membrane and accumulates in the cell nucleus. The Journal Of Biological Chemistry, 272(25), 16010-16017.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, my question is not whether or not this ever occurs - it clearly does - but to what extent do CPPs isolated from internal sequences of native proteins have CPP-like functions in their native proteins?<\/p>\n\n<p>I have only begun to research CPPs and PTDs in their native proteins and in the drug-delivery setting because it became apparent that a protein I am studying for an undergraduate thesis may have an internal PTD which is essential for its function. I am no expert on the topic and I would appreciate information on CPPs/PTDs including further synonyms for CPPs/PTDs to aid in my literature search - especially synonyms specific to native proteins with CPP-like functions. If anyone interested in answering this question is not an expert, the best resource I can currently provide for a list of CPPs derived from natural proteins (besides the Milletti 2012 article above) is:<\/p>\n\n<p>Hallbrink, M., Kilk, K., Elmquist, A., Lundberg, P., Lindgren, M., Jiang, Y., &amp; ... Langel, U. (n.d). Prediction of cell-penetrating peptides. International Journal Of Peptide Research And Therapeutics, 11(4), 249-259.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Milletti 2012 article also covers some CPPs isolated from other viruses. The system I am studying for my thesis is a virus, so any information specifically on CPPs and PTDs function in the native proteins of viruses would be particularly useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will be continuing to research this topic for my thesis, so if you're interested in answering this question but require more information, feel free to comment asking for specific information that would help.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","question_id":45309,"tags":["proteins","virus","virology","cell-membrane","transformation"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8604f06b706104963ee5150062b60394?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":23268,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23268/thumbs","reputation":1,"display_name":"thumbs"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c33b5588bbd268ce2680853ea79b1a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/231/mgkrebbs","reputation":3086,"display_name":"mgkrebbs"},"score":2,"post_id":45306,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460917422,"comment_id":79245,"body":"Turn your hand over, then they&#39;ll be on the  same side.

Let me further assume that you have 96 samples, which means that you have one complete PCR plate full of samples. First you prepare your samples. You are doing a amplicon PCR, clean that PCR, attach the adapters which are necessary that the sequences can bind to the glas slide and at last you are attaching indexes. \nYou are attaching these barcodes individually for each sample.\nLooks like that image:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4J1LG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4J1LG.jpg\" alt=\"Indexing / adding barcode-combinations to each sample\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>source: https://www.neb.com/~/media/Catalog/All-Protocols/C411AB12AFB04000BED567FC17B2A4AA/Content/PCRPlate.jpg\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Let's call such indices barcodes (index = barcode). As you can see, each sample gets its own combination of a indexing primer as you are using always to primers (i7+i5) for each sample. Whats important is, is that all these primers are individuals like:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Line:\n1: AAAAAT\n2: AAAATT\n3: AAATTT\n\nand:\nA: TTTGGG\nB: TTGGGG\nC: TGGGGG\n\n(In reality these primers are longer and more complex!)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>After you have done such a indexing PCR and also cleaned your PCR (get rid of the polymerase, something like this) you have to pool your samples (put them all together) before you are sequencing. And thats the point why such indexes are important. Without indexing you would have no chance to get your samples separated (=demultiplexed) again after sequencing. <\/p>\n\n<p>When you are sequencing paired-end then you are sequencing one time forward (barcode + adapter + the sequence you want to have) and one time reverse (barcode + adapter + the sequence you want to have). One big amplicon of e.g. 500 bps gives you two sequences: the forward sequence (also called forward read) and the reverse read. <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Let's call the forward read: R1\nAnd the reverse read: R2\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>After sequencing you have one big pool of sequences. What you are doing first is to demultiplex your samples. As you know now you have for each samples hundreds of thousands of sequences: each consists of two Parts: The R1 read and the R2 read. What you are doing now is to separate your sequences again: You know that you used for example the indexing primers AAAATTTT and CCCCGGGG (just examples!) for your first sample. So you know that AAAATTTT belongs to the forward (R1) read and CCCCGGGG belongs to the reverse (R2) read. This means, that, when you separate all sequences which contains at the \"barcoding/indexing-position\" these sequences, you know that these are sequences which belong to your sample 1. For sample two you used for example the barcodes AATTAATT and CCGGCCGG and then you know again: AATTAATT belongs to the R1 read and CCGGCCGG belongs to the R2 read. Filtering that sequences out and save them in an additional file you will get your sample 2 separated. And that's why such indexes are important and that's also the reason why you always have to indexes: one is used for the forward read, and one for the reverse read. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally: Why basically we have to use primers is the following: If you want to sequence an amplicon you (or at least the machine) is only able to sequence about 250 bps in each direction. When you are attaching indexes (which are in each case needed) then you are able to sequence in both directions: forward and reverse. And afterwards, when you have demultiplexed your samples you can run an assembly to put the forward and reverse reads together again. <\/p>\n","answer_id":45286,"question_id":45278,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1460818560}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45278/paired-end-illumina-sequencing","last_activity_date":1460818560,"creation_date":1460790217,"answer_count":1,"title":"Paired-end illumina sequencing","body":"<p>I'm tying to understand the mechanism of paired end illumina sequencing, however I dont't  understand why index primer 1 and index primer 2 are used. \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyCqWhwB8E\" rel=\"nofollow\">paired end illumina sequencing (YouTube)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>I hope someone can clarify the index primers 1&amp;2,<\/p>\n\n<p>Thankyou,<\/p>\n","question_id":45278,"tags":["dna-sequencing"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":45286,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83e6b81f4aa0ad72bfb30b573176dab0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":577,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/577/alex-stone","reputation":2566,"display_name":"Alex Stone","accept_rate":77},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8921ce1c834fd3bcf773bd7305ac5b30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1166/jello","reputation":911,"display_name":"jello"},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83e6b81f4aa0ad72bfb30b573176dab0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":577,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/577/alex-stone","reputation":2566,"display_name":"Alex Stone","accept_rate":77},"score":0,"post_id":3362,"edited":false,"creation_date":1346158123,"comment_id":5050,"body":"Thank you for a great and informative answer!"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1346116522,"creation_date":1346116522,"body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vitamin B12<\/a> (cobalamin) is a water-soluble vitamin required for homocysteine methyltransferase. In order to be absorbed, it must bind to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">intrinsic factor<\/a> (IF), which is produced by the parietal cells of the stomach. The absorption of the vitamin B12-IF complex occurs in the terminal ileum (of the small intestine). The quote just means that if there isn't enough IF, then you can't absorb vitamin B12.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many things that limit absorption of vitamins, and even vitamin B12. Because vitamin B12 is found in animal products, vegetarians and vegans may need to supplement it. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that destroys IF or the parietal cells, Gastric bypass surgery can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. Anything that affects vitamin B12 absorption in the terminal ileum, such as in Crohn's, celiac disease, or enteritis, can lead to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">deficiency<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, no. Yes, it will use some IF (provided you have IF), but that would allow your body to absorb vitamin B12.

So is this possible outside of science fiction? To answer this we have to compare the stages of human reproduction and how close today's science and technology can come replicating/sustaining them. <\/p>\n\n<p>We'll begin by dividing these stages into two groups: fertilization and development of embryo to fetus.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to answering the question of whether fertilization can be replicated in vitro or not, the answer is yes it can be done! In fact <strong>in vitro artificial fertilization (IVF)<\/strong> has been possible for several decades. In most cases when IVF is performed the egg is then placed inside the mother's uterus where it goes onto to develop into an embryo and then fetus. In regards to \"ectogenesis\" the IVF egg would be placed into an artificial womb.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to form a zygote (fertilized egg) to develop properly into a fetus it has to be an environment to meet it needs. In a female uterus all these needs are met but replicating them might be difficult. An artificial womb would have to be able to provide nutrients, oxygen, and channels for the development process of a fetus as well as system to expel (birth) the fetus once its development is complete. So can today's technology and science do all this? In theory yes, if resources and time where dedicated (and red tape cut) it would be possible to develop a fertilized egg in an artificial environment within the foreseeable future.

For example, if a sound is coming from the left, the left ear will receive the highest sound level. The sound stimulus will also have a shorter latency because of the intervening head tissue, and a phase difference due to the time lag <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/715.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Van Wanrooij &amp; Opstal, 2007)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9FPyC.jpg\" alt=\"head shadow\"><br>\n<sup>Head shadow effect at high, but not at low frequencies.

The spectral cues arise from direction-dependent reflections within the pinna (described by so-called head-related transfer functions, see below figure graphs). The pinna provide a monaural localization cue for sound frequencies exceeding about 3\u20134 kHz <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/715.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Van Wanrooij &amp; Opstal, 2007)<\/a>.   <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cvbRh.gif\" alt=\"Pinna\"><br>\n<sup>Head-related transfer function due to the pinna.

Hence, all available cues seem to be <em>integrated<\/em> for both vertical and horizontal localization. Nonetheless, the two distinct pathways are the primary and preferred ways of the auditory system to determine elevation and azimuth. However, when one ear is plugged, or in unilateral deaf people, the textbook binaural hearing in the horizontal plane may be substituted by monaural cues, and I quote from <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/715.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Van Wanrooij &amp; Opstal, 2007)<\/a>: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[L]isteners rely on monaural spectral cues for sound-source azimuth localization as soon as the binaural difference cues break down.  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, to wrap up, unilateral deafness degrades directional hearing and in particular in the horizontal plane.

As an example, consider soft drinks that are usually served cold: they taste sweeter when warm (like you said with your examples of drinks).<\/p>\n\n<p>Our taste receptors send a stronger signal to the brain when activated by warmer substances and so the perception of sweetness, in this case, is lessened when we consume cold food or drink.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are taste receptors on the surface of our tongue which refer to the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 which, which bind to the \u201csweet-tasting\u201d molecules. \nWhen the molecules bind to the receptors, they trigger a series of actions which increase the number of positively charged potassium ions (K<sup>+<\/sup>) in the cell to which the receptor is attached. In order for the signal to continue along to the brain, the cumulative positive charge of the potassium ions must be high enough to activate a TRPM5 channel into the cell, so that calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>) can pass through. The Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> ions are required for the release of neurotransmitters which send the signal. This channel requires a much lower positive charge for activation when it is warm than when it is cold.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if you were to put, e.g., a cold coke into your mouth, it decreases the temperature of the entire tongue and consequently the TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 proteins, and the TRPM5 channel. This will result in it requiring a greater positive charge in order for the signals to travel to the brain.
