There are different types of chromosomal sex determination. If one sex is heterogametic (an example of one system like this are mammals, which have an X and a Y chromosome) then the sexual phenotype (male versus female) is determined by the presence (or absence) of the Y chromosome. If you have a Y you will develop testes,and the androgens produced by the testes will direct all of your secondary sexual characteristics to develop the male fates.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the absence of a Y chromosome the default developmental pathway of the somatic gonads is to form ovaries. The ovaries produce estrogen which will direct all of your secondary sexual \ncharacteristics to develop female fates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gametes are either sperm or eggs.  Early after fertilization some of the embryonic cells get sequestered away to form the primordial germ cells (PGCs). Later on these cells will mature in the somatic gonad to form the germline, giving rise to more sperm (or eggs).  These germline cells have no effect on the sex or gender of a mammal.  In some animals (like model organisms that can be subjected to genetic screens) you can isolate sexually transformed mutants where, for example  the XX animals develop as males and produce sperm, and the XY animals develop as females and produce oocytes.

Do we agree that charge separation (between the two sides of the membrane) is the thing which creates the potential? meaning, if the charge concentrations at the two sides were the same, then the membrane potential was zero. right?\nSo here is the thing. You have much more Ca outside the cell than inside and you have much more potassium inside than outside. So now, if you add Ca outside, you increase the difference between the two sides (the separation of Calcium ions) so that Ca will be in a greater state of unrest, the system will be less stable and the potential will be higher. On the other hand, when you add K outside, you narrow the gap between its two concentrations on the two sides (decrease its gradient), so now it'll experience less tension, less unrest, hence contribute less potential to the membrane. \nRemember that in our cells, the ion pumps are the ones which serve as the battery that keeps the potential fixed.

In contrast, we would predict that in species with high G-C content, the open reading frames would be biased, in general, to using codons that are higher in G-C.\nThat is all G-C bias in codons is; for some amino acids like Met and Trp, there is only a single codon, but for other amino acids there can be up to six codons that can each encode the same amino acid side chain. It is in these ones with a higher number of degenerate codons that you are going to see the effect of codon bias.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44897,"question_id":44888,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44888/does-gc-content-determine-codon-bias-or-does-codon-bias-determine-gc-content","last_activity_date":1459817664,"creation_date":1459796562,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does GC content determine codon bias or does codon bias determine GC content","body":"<p>I was wondering if someone knows the answer to this quenstion, because I can't find a clear answer, maybe there isn't a clear answer :). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>question<\/strong>\nWhich of these two is right? or maybe both influence each other<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GC% determines codon bias  <\/li>\n<li>codon bias determines GC%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Thankyou,<\/p>\n","question_id":44888,"tags":["genomes","human-genome","codon"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":44897,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50bbe73e213e2ac3e9383a2323e48111?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":22410,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22410/albac","reputation":58,"display_name":"aLbAc"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e3d7d90dc79abd85951f31ca8f5b21a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22731,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22731/fanli","reputation":121,"display_name":"fanli"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1459810868,"creation_date":1459810868,"body":"<p>I think this will vary greatly depending on the source environment.

It is usually combined with an estimated (or counted) percentage, so 10% confluency means that 10% of the surface the dish or flask used is covered with cells, 100% means that it is entirely covered. The cells grow twodimensional on the surface of the flask in this case.

Low density cells (10-20%) usually grow slower than 50% confluent cells. If the plate is complete grown by cells, they tend to grow much slower again. This influences their genetic program, behaviour in experiments and transfections.<\/p>\n\n<p>As @Roland pointed out it is important to say that confluency is not a hard measure, but rather an estimate of the cell density.

The answer is that some silica contains toxic additives. For example, silica gel beads may contain toxic and potentially carcinogenic cobalt(II) chloride, which is added as a moisture indicator. You can recognize silica containing cobalt chloride because it will be colored blue (dry) or pink (hydrated). Another common moisture indicator is methyl violet, which is orange (dry) or green (hydrated). Methyl violet is a mutagen and mitotic poison.

The only answer choice that seems to fit this is \"high light intensity\" (although I'm not sure if high light intensity would necessarily cause high temperatures, but this seems to be the closest thing to what I predicted). However, the exam key is saying that \"D\", nighttime, is the correct answer. My teacher explained that since plants don't need to do the light reactions during the night, they apparently close their stomata because they don't need to intake CO2. But this doesn't make sense to me: why would a plant close its stomata during the night instead of keeping it open to stockpile CO2 for use in the day? If I'm not mistaken, this is precisely what CAM plants do (although there's no mention of whether the plant in question is a CAM plant).<\/p>\n","question_id":44823,"tags":["botany","photosynthesis"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8adae36f7b1f7d9829a28a88ac38f826?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17239,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17239/curious-cat","reputation":212,"display_name":"curious_cat","accept_rate":30},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8adae36f7b1f7d9829a28a88ac38f826?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17239,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17239/curious-cat","reputation":212,"display_name":"curious_cat","accept_rate":30},"score":0,"post_id":44820,"edited":false,"creation_date":1459624171,"comment_id":78159,"body":"Thanks!

Pathogenic bacteria will have antigen on their surface that mark them as 'foreign', leading to an immune response targeted to the bacteria. In contrast, the immune system <strong>tolerates<\/strong> the normal flora of the body. The precise role that the human immune system takes in <strong>tolerating and regulating<\/strong> the populations of the normal flora is not known, it is currently a hot area of research.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current research suggests that microbiota induces host immune tolerance to commensal bacteria directly via a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) and polysaccharide (PSA) signalling. The immune system continuously monitors the resident microbiota, and certain antimicrobial mechanisms are constitutively engaged to prevent overgrowth of the colonizing microbes: this maintains what is loosely called <strong>immune homeostasis<\/strong>. The mechanisms that control (intestinal) tolerance include those that:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1)<\/strong> <strong>minimize<\/strong> <strong>exposure<\/strong> to and <strong>2)<\/strong> immune <strong>recognition<\/strong> of intestinal microbiota, and <strong>3)<\/strong> those that <strong>down-regulate<\/strong> immune responses through intra-cellular and inter-cellular mechanisms. <\/p>\n\n<p>Research has shown that he tolerance of the normal microbiota of the gut seems to require an extensive network of <strong>regulatory immune cells<\/strong> including <strong>Tregs<\/strong> and (<strong>tolerogenic<\/strong>) <strong>dendritic cells<\/strong>.\nThymus-derived <strong>Tregs<\/strong> were discovered by Dr. Leszek Ignatowicz to be a crucial  player involved in \"educating\" the immune system about the diverse bacterial colonies in the intestinal flora <strong>of mice<\/strong>. In response to the diversity of gut bacteria found in the gut, the Tregs express a 'repertoire T cell receptors' (<strong>TCR<\/strong>) that recognize the antigens characteristic of individual bacterial colonies in the gut. Upon engagement of these receptors, <strong>Tregs suppresses<\/strong> the <strong>adaptive<\/strong> immune response, specifically through the release of <strong>immune-modulatory cytokines<\/strong> such as interleukin-2. Moreover, it was found that gut bacteria can also be <strong>recognized<\/strong> and protected by a <strong>distinct innate<\/strong> lymphoid cell population (ILC) in the intestinal lining of mice. These cells behave like antigen presenting cells, and can recognize and present antigens from gut bacteria through the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). But rather than activating CD4+ T lymphocytes through MHCII engagement, these ILC works by <strong>suppressing CD4+ T lymphocytes<\/strong> through MHCII engagement. CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in clearing pathogen/bacteria, and thus the suppression of CD4+ T lymphocytes is involved in the immune-tolerance of normal flora. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X14000083\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X14000083<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007055/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007055/<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":44688,"question_id":44476,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1459546375}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44476/does-our-immune-system-react-on-all-bacteria","last_activity_date":1459546375,"creation_date":1458571286,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does our immune system react on all bacteria?","body":"<p>In our body we carry a lot of bacteria.

ILAE defines an <strong><em>epileptic seizure<\/em><\/strong> as a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to <strong>abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15816939\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Fisher <em>et al<\/em>., 2005)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, by definition, <strong>epilepsy is a disorder of the brain<\/strong>. Note that the ILAE is an authorative organ and their definition overrides whatever your medical textbook on internal medicine says.<\/p>\n\n<p>An <em>epileptic focus<\/em> is a commonly used term, but as far as I know not well-defined. It's often used in relation to EEG and other methods such as MRI and PET that attempt to define the hot spot of seizure activity. More strictly defined terms in this regard are <strong><em>eloquent cortex<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>epileptogenic zone<\/em><\/strong>. The eloquent cortex refers to any <strong>cortical area<\/strong> in which injury produces symptomatic cognitive or motor deficit. The epileptogenic zone refers to the region of <strong>cerebral cortex<\/strong> that is both necessary and sufficient to generate epileptic seizures. Its entire removal can be used as a treatment for intractable epilepsy <a href=\"http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/1/179.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Richardson, 2003)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to your question, I expect you are referring to the epileptogenic zone.

This point is emphasized in <a href=\"http://jcm.asm.org/content/52/3/871.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">the abstract by Hilt et. al. linked in the question<\/a>. Of the cultures that grew in their \"expanded quantitative urine culture\" protocol, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>90% of these specimens were deemed \"No Growth\" by the standard urine culture technique, highlighting its limitations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The last phrase \"highlighting its limitations\" is an interesting one. It appears to me to be yet to be proven that this is a clinically meaningful \"limitation\" of such assays. Without attempting to refute these data  &mdash; fortunately this question doesn't require me to do so &mdash; I will note that the two linked studies aimed to show that people with overactive bladder are characterized by increased urinary flora. The explicitly stated hypothesis is that this may contribute to symptoms. Even in this study demonstrating the existence of such a micro-biome even in normal people, then, it is understood as a potentially pathologic state. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason this \"mantra persists\", then, is that it remains true <strong>for clinical purposes<\/strong>. In contrast to most (all?) other bodily discharges, urine is not packed with bacteria, and the commonly used assays reflect this fact.  Medicine and laboratory science have different \"modes of discourse\", each calibrated to convey levels of precision that are appropriate to the outcomes of interest. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>Notes<\/sub>   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>\n1. In American English at least, that adverb is ambiguous, meaning either \"for practical purposes\" or (idiomatically) \"almost\". Both senses are intended here.\n<\/sub>    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>\n2. Of course, there are plenty of data in various populations demonstrating that some substantial minority of urinalyses among asymptomatic people return positive, \"proving\" that we shouldn't be checking them (amen!).

This can cause haemolysis of transfused blood that has a different antigenicity to that of the erythrocytes of the recipient, whose immune system consequently regards it as foreign.<\/p>\n\n<p>The major ABO blood group system of humans involves the gene for a glycosyltransferase which catalyses the addition of particular sugars to glycocoproteins or glycolipids. In addition to inactivation of the gene (giving blood group O in homozygotes) there are two forms of the active gene, encoding enzymes  transfering either <em>N<\/em>-acetyl galactosamine or galactose (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v9/n9/abs/nsb832.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ah61t.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6xx6e.png\" alt=\"Reactions producing A- or B-antigen\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The ABO system is found in non-human primates, although with AO, BO and AB as variants in different species (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/45/18493\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>). Various other animals have polymorphism in this system \u2014 pigs, for example, are AO (<a href=\"http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/97/10/3308\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>). Most animals possess the ABO gene (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene?Db=homologene&amp;Cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=69306\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>), although it may or may not be expressed, and, if it is, may or may not give rise to polymorphism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blood group systems exist in other animals that involve different genes. The confusingly-named AB system of cats, for example, involves the gene for an acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, which catalyses the formation of the activated precursor for addition of <em>N<\/em>-glycolylneuraminic acid to cell-surface glycans (<a href=\"http://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-8-27\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a>).

This could be because the pathogens bind the sugars to gain entry into the cells, or because they have similar sugars on their own cell surface and so do not provoke an immune response from the host. However the counter-argument of non-functional genetic drift (@CactusWoman) is difficult to exclude if one focuses solely on the ABO system. <\/p>\n\n<p>The functional argument becomes more convincing if one considers that the ABO blood types are just one example of the ability of animals to vary the sugars on their cell by selecting from a large repertoire of genes with the potential to specify different glycosylating enzymes (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/voxs.12044/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">8<\/a>). This is shown by the fact that different animals exhibit different sugar antigens on the surface of their erythrocytes (whether or not they display polymorphism). There are over 100 genes for glycosylating enzymes, but one example of this diversity is instructive. The ABO gene has undergone duplication and, of perhaps seven members of this family (<a href=\"http://glycob.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/5/516.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">9<\/a>), the products of three are well characterized (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908401012949\" rel=\"nofollow\">10<\/a>,<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060172\" rel=\"nofollow\">11<\/a>,<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/93/20/10697.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">12<\/a>), although their genes are either inactive in humans or not expressed in erythrocytes (i.e. in their precursors).

It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals, or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical usage.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contamination\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contamination<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The acute health effects of hydrocarbon mixtures are generally associated with exposure concentrations at thousands of ppm.

Specifically, excessive subcortical release of dopamine is thought to increase D<sub>2<\/sub> receptor activation, disturbing the cortical pathway through the nucleus accumbens (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brisch <em>et al<\/em>., 2014<\/a>), called the <strong>mesolimbic pathway<\/strong> (Fig. 1). These positive effects can be treated quite effectively with the classical, first-generation anti-dopaminergic <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/first-generation-antipsychotics-for-treating-schizophrenia\" rel=\"nofollow\">antipsychotics<\/a> such as <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/first-generation-antipsychotics-for-treating-schizophrenia\" rel=\"nofollow\">haloperidol<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/first-generation-antipsychotics-for-treating-schizophrenia\" rel=\"nofollow\">chlorpromazine<\/a>.    <\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is another important aspect on schizophrenia, which are the <strong><a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/schizophrenia-booklet-12-2015/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">negative symptoms<\/a><\/strong>. While the full-blown psychoses occur in waves, these negative symptoms are a more continuous and persistent phenomenon. The symptoms include a flattened affect and dysphoria (reduced pleasure in life). These symptoms are thought to occur due to altered prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning. Specifically, they are thought to be induced by hypoactivity in dopaminergic D<sub>1<\/sub> transmission (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brisch <em>et al<\/em>., 2014<\/a>) in the mesocortical pathway (Fig. 1). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ty9mZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ty9mZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1. The dopamine pathways in the brain, including the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, implicated in the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, respectively. source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesocortical_pathway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>.<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>These two sides of schizophrenia point to an <a href=\"http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/for/curr/AbiDargham/\" rel=\"nofollow\">imbalance in DA activity<\/a> in the brain, namely hyperactive subcortical mesolimbic D<sub>2<\/sub> activity leading to positive symptoms, and hypoactive mesocortical D<sub>1<\/sub> activity in the PFC resulting in negative symptoms. This imbalance hypothesis is the revised DA hypothesis and it is still an accepted working model (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brisch <em>et al<\/em>., 2014<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, as noted by others, schizophrenia is a complex disease and it is thought that besides DA, also serotonin, glutamate and GABA play a role <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430681/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Olijslagers <em>et al<\/em>., 2006)<\/a>. The current first line of treatment of schizophrenia are <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/drug-class/atypical-antipsychotics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>atypical neuroleptics<\/strong><\/a>, such as <a href=\"http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00363\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clozapine<\/a>. Clozapine is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT<sub>2<\/sub>), dopamine Type 2 (D<sub>2<\/sub>), 1 and 2 adrenergic, and H<sub>1<\/sub> histaminergic receptors. Clozapine acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. The broad effects of Clozapine are thought to underlie its potent antipsychotic therapeutic effect. It is believed it mainly works through a combination of antagonistic effects at D<sub>2<\/sub> receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5-HT<sub>2<\/sub>A receptors in the frontal cortex. D<sub>2<\/sub> antagonism relieves positive symptoms while 5-HT<sub>2<\/sub>A antagonism alleviates negative symptoms.    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032934/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brisch <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Front Psychiatry<\/em> (2014); <strong>5<\/strong>: 47<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430681/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olijslagers <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Curr Neuropharmacol<\/em> (2006); <strong>4<\/strong>(1): 59\u201368<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":44727,"question_id":16295,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1459343702}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16295/dopamine-paradox-in-schizophrenia","last_activity_date":1459343702,"creation_date":1396415282,"answer_count":2,"title":"Dopamine paradox in schizophrenia","body":"<p>If there is more dopamine action in the mesocortical pathway in schizophrenia, then schizophrenics should always be in euphoric state.
