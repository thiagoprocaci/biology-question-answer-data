Well, that means that when the partial pressure of CO is 1mmHg, you're well and truly dead. So if the bar headed goose could survive in an environment more than 1% CO its hemoglobin would have to bind to molecular oxygen very, very tightly below 1mmHg.

Well... <em>Not entirely<\/em>.

The proposed double helical structure of DNA has been published and the race is on to understand the implications of this for genetics. Geneticists have been working with genes for decades, but they don't know what genes are. Sanger has sequenced the two polypeptides of insulin, so the idea of a specific sequence of amino acids is established. The emerging molecular geneticists believe that genes will be explained by a feature of DNA, probably a sequence of nucleotides, but they don't know how. Crick and others are theorising about coding (i.e DNA > protein), but at this stage there is no genetic code, no mRNA or tRNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>Seymour Benzer, at Purdue, is working on <em>fine structure of a genetic region in bacteriophage<\/em> and in this year he publishes a key paper with that phrase as the title. Without going into a lot of detail about his experimental set up, he is studying a region of the bacteriophage T4 genome called rII. Wild-type T4 can form plaques on <em>E. coli<\/em> B or <em>E. coli K12<\/em>. Mutations in the rII region cause a large plaque phenotype in <em>E. coli<\/em> B so it is easy to isolate them, but these phage cannot produce plaques on <em>E. coli<\/em> K12 which sets the scene for a powerful assay for rare recombination events.<\/p>\n\n<p>Benzer used this system to do very fine mapping of thousands of rII mutations because he was able to use the system to measure recombination frequencies, but what matters in the present context is that he was able to do a kind of complementation test (he called this pseudo-allelism). He was able to assign the rII mutants into two groups according to whether, in a mixed infection, they produced lots of progeny. So if he mixed two phage with different mutations and didn't get many progeny he put these in the same group. On the other hand if he did get a lot of progeny he placed the two in different groups. He called this approach a cis-trans test. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The application of the phenotype test to pairs of rII mutants leads to the division of the region into two functionally separable segments.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is as close as he dared to go to claiming to be studying genes. He refers to 'functional units' but never uses the word 'genes' because at this stage that word belonged to classical genetics in higher organisms. In 1957 he proposed the word <strong>cistron<\/strong> for the functional unit defined by this type of test, and the word caught on, particularly because of its incorporation into the operon model with the idea of polycistronic mRNA. His other coinings, <strong>muton<\/strong> and <strong>recon<\/strong> were not adopted.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two T4 genes/cistrons in the rII region of the phage genome are now called rIIA and rIIB.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Benzer, S (1955) Fine structure of a genetic region in bacteriophage Proc.

In general there are three ways to do this:<\/p>\n\n<p>Alkylation, a good example is pyridine.  These compounds covalently modify the DNA and either cause a mutation by misincorporation during DNA replication (where the wrong base is incorporated across from the alkylated base), or by generation of double strand breaks during DNA replication that result in a mutations during the repair process (the details of which are not in-scope here).<\/p>\n\n<p>Intercalation, my favourite example being ethidium bromide.  These compounds literally insert themselves between the bases of the double helix, where they cause \"fork collapse\" during DNA replication, and the ensuing repair process mutates the DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ionization through radicals.  Yes, carcinogens can generate radicals that will generate DNA damage.  A good example is doxorubicin, which is a highly effective chemotherapeutic, but also a carcinogen in its own right.  Some heavy metals can also generate radicals under the right circumstances.  These compounds typically oxidize the bases of DNA, and result in broad misincorporation during DNA replication.  Radicals can also result in breakage of the phosphodiester backbone, which cause mutations during repair. This mechanism is taken advantage of in some methods for studying the primary and secondary structure of RNA molecules, and in \"foot printing\" methods.  Incidentally, it is this mechanism of carcinogenesis that causes antioxidants to be associated with the prevention of cancer.  Compounds like vitamin C soak up the radicals generated by the carcinogen (or radiation), thereby preventing the damage from occurring.<\/p>\n\n<p>An interesting point: pyrimidine dimers, which are generated whenever you get a sunburn, are a carcinogenic form of DNA damage somewhere between the ionization and alkylation mechanisms.  UV light induces a redox reaction that results in covalent linkage of two neighboring pyrimidines.  A dedicated repair process can cause a mutation at the site of the dimer.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the take home point is that the DNA damage itself is not usually the mechanism of mutation!  Mutation occurs when the damage is repaired, either as part of a dedicated repair process, or by (non)homologous recombination after a stall in DNA replication.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question.  It is a complicated subject, and I doubt I covered everything here.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19167,"question_id":14399,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1403040695}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14399/carcinogens-how-do-they-work","last_activity_date":1403040695,"creation_date":1389382636,"answer_count":1,"title":"Carcinogens, how do they work?","body":"<p>The easiest carcinogenic thing for me to grasp is radiation, as it directly messes with DNA.

Although male learning ability was weakly correlated with saturation of the orange patches on his body (a sexually selected trait (...)), orange saturation surprisingly did not correlate with female preferences. Thus, the cues leading female guppies to prefer faster learners are unknown.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is possible, that females base their choose on some factors that correlates with cognitive skills or on total wellness, what may depend on intelligence.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) bowerbird's abilities to build bowers (courtship constructions):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Comparative studies across bowerbird species have shown that relative brain size is larger in species that build bowers than in closely related nonbuilding species (Madden 2001 <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1469/833.short\">5<\/a>). In addition, relative brain size increases with the species-typical complexity of the bower (Madden 2001 <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1469/833.short\">5<\/a>), and a comparative study on the relative size of specific brain regions showed that species with more complex bowers have a relatively larger cerebellum (Day et al. 2005 <a href=\"http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstractBuch&amp;ArtikelNr=85048&amp;ProduktNr=230875\">6<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>4) foraging performance<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A recent experiment by Snowberg and Benkman (2009) <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01699.x/full\">7<\/a> using red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) showed that, after observing 2 males extracting seeds from conifer cones, females associated preferentially with the more efficient forager of the 2. The authors were able to exclude female choice for correlated traits by experimentally manipulating foraging efficiency, such that fewer seeds were available in the cones of one of the males. The males were also swapped between treatments (i.e., slow vs. fast forager) so that male identity could not explain the females\u2019 preferences for the most efficient forager.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another way that intelligence may be favored by sexual selection is \"cheating\" during courtship. For example most frog species call to attract females. But this signal may also attract aggresive rivals or predators. Some males, especially the weaker ones, do not call  but stay near calling individual.  This allows them to avoid confrontation and wait for approaching females [8]. The successfulness of this strategy may depend on how \"smart\" the individual is (only my opinion).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/3/447.abstract\"><strong>[1] Boogert, N.

But after that, for the next 60 degree of rotation of the humerus, its rotation is distributed in a 2:1 ratio to the Scapulathoracic joint.\nHe said that beyond that, the Humerus is locked into the socket with Acromium and Coracoid Process.

Once you have the amino acids, then you just look at the order in which they get through and then you have your peptide sequence. Please read about the B, A and Y-type ions although this page is slightly technical (<a href=\"http://www.matrixscience.com/help/fragmentation_help.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matrixscience.com/help/fragmentation_help.html<\/a>). If the proteins was not digested then it would be far too big to be analysed since it would be read as one massive blob of m/z, which could be anything! So once you have your spectra from a peptide, you need to compare it to a model spectra, and based on that you predict what the sequence is as fragmentations peaks can be anything. Look at SEQUEST (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_spectrometry_software\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_spectrometry_software<\/a>).

What I think you are thinking in terms of the set machine limit, is the (digested) peptide fragment that enters the machine, before undergoing electrospray. Now the experts that run the MS machines do set a peptide mass upper and lower limit, for what size/mass of fragment to accept and what size/mass to ignore.

To compensate and protect the genetic information there are caps \u2013 regions of excess nucleotides \u2013 at the ends called telomeres (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22759812\">Silvestre, 2012<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Mammalian cells do not replenish their telomeres after cell division, giving them a replicative lifespan;  a maximum number of cell divisions before the telomeres run out. The cells then either enter a state of senescence and no longer divide, or initiate programmed cell death. However each cell has the genetic information for telomerase \u2013 the enzyme that can replenish the telomeres \u2013 but cannot use it. Only embryos and stem cells are able to express telomerase in mammalian cells - this protects against the build up of damage to DNA causing uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Activated telomerase is a core feature of many cancers (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341437\">Campbell, 2012<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Plant Telomeres<\/h3>\n\n<p>You mention telomeres in your question, and it is an interesting question I had never considered. Plants have no germline preserved, so their progeny must bear all the defects of their particular parent cell, and that plant cells must therefore all have the capacity to regenerate their telomeres. I found a paper by Fajkus and colleagues that finds telomerase activity in plant cuttings grown in culture (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9894917\">Fajkus, 1998<\/a>). Their hypothetical Plant Telomere-Length Regulating (PTLR) protein must arise in the early stages of the culture and last only a few cycles. Interestingly it seems that the efficiency of this process varies between different plant species. The authors note that their plant of choice \u2013 tobacco \u2013 is particularly proliferative and that other plants such as barley were harder to grow from cuttings, which may be down to a different way of regulating the telomerase (for instance it could only be activated occasionally at low amounts).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Do Plants Get Cancer?<\/h3>\n\n<p>It seems to me the next obvious question. One of the first papers I came across (published in 1916 by the Journal of Cancer Research!) talks of Crown Gall in plants and its relation to human cancer (<a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/jcanres/1/2/231.short\">Smith, 1916<\/a>). Many websites cite galls as being the equivalent to cancer in plants, but it appears that the outgrowths (galls) that appear very tumour-like are in fact caused by bacteria encouraging their surrounding cells to proliferate. (See <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/761/how-do-galls-form\">this question<\/a> for more detail on galls).<\/p>\n\n<p>I later found an abstract (I cannot access the full paper) from a paper published in Nature in 2010 called \u201cWalls around tumours \u2014 why plants do not develop cancer\u201d (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrc2942\">Doonan, 2010<\/a>). It appears that Plants can and do develop tumours, but they are less frequent and less lethal due to fundamental differences in development between plant and animal cells. Singh and colleagues found that in 2 plant species (<em>Arabidopsis<\/em> and rice) there were DNA damage repair pathways well conserved but with variation; there were several gene duplications in different DNA repair pathways (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-443\">Singh, 2010<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Plants Do Not \u201cAge\u201d As We Do<\/h3>\n\n<p>Although I could find no conclusive evidence, it seems to me likely that plants may also have enhanced maintenance against other cellular stresses than DNA damage, such as build-ups of aberrant proteins. It therefore appears that in a protected environment some plants could live indefinitely. I say some, because others deliberately end their lives after reproduction. Traits such as longevity are inherently hard to be selected for, as the advantages come long after reproductive maturity and are therefore under much less selective pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>We see plants wither and die, but this is because they are constantly subject to environmental insult. Animals and insects may eat them, there may not be enough food or water, or sunlight, or the plant may become infected. All of which are at the macroscopic level. Due to completely different evolutionary constraints and pressures plants are highly resilient to cellar stresses, possibly due to differences in metabolic rate, and apparently have indefinite replicative potential.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong>\nAlthough the more I think about it, the more it seems that most plant must have an ultimate lifespan, in that as they forever grow and expand their tissues would gradually harden and become less functional (I am mostly imagining bark plants here). Although as the layers of bark are pushed out the layers below take the place.

The metabolism of testosterone is catalized by inducible P450 1A1, 1A2, 3A3, 3A4 and 3A5 enzymes.

This new construct was then inserted into the genome of the mouse.\nThe result is a mouse in which the cells that normally transcribe the Rgs9 gene also produce Cre.<\/p>\n\n<p>This mouse line was then crossed with a reporter mouse line called gtROSA26, which expresses a certain protein called $\\beta$-galactosidase in a Cre-dependent manner. <\/p>\n\n<p>The gene for the galactosidase is present in all the cells, but only where Cre is present (in our case the Rgs9 positive cells) it will be transcribed.\nEventually the crossing leads to the expression of $\\beta$-galactosidase in Rgs9 positive cells. \n$\\beta$-galactosidase has the nice property that it can change the colour of certain chemicals to blue, which allows to easily visualize the cells that produce it. This can help you answer questions like: \"where is the Rgs9 gene transcribed?\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia has a neat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_nomenclature\" rel=\"nofollow\">page on Gene nomenclature<\/a> with lots of links to nomenclature guidelines. <\/p>\n","answer_id":19097,"question_id":19095,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1402733702}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19095/what-are-these-strings-used-to-describe-animals","last_activity_date":1402774554,"creation_date":1402689130,"answer_count":2,"title":"What are these strings used to describe animals?","body":"<p>For example, what's a $dt^{sz}$ hamster?

The average human skin has been estimated to cover an area of 1.5-2 m$^2.$ We can use 2.5 mm and 1.7 m$^2$, respectively. This gives a volume of 0.00425 m$^3$ or 4250 mL in fluid volume. The information for this calculation is at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki site<\/a> on human skin. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_water\" rel=\"nofollow\">One estimate<\/a> of the average total volume of fluid in a human body is 40L. Of that, 5L is blood. So roughly 1/8 of the body's fluid is blood. To a good approximation, the body is about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid\" rel=\"nofollow\">60% water<\/a> by weight. This is presumably a little less than the percentage of fluids generally but since these are rough numbers we can use it. So 60% of the skin is fluid/water, and 1/8$th$ of this is blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of the 4.250 L of skin, 60% is fluid, of which 1/8 $^{th}$ is blood, so $(4.25) \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = 0.3188$ liters of blood at any given moment in the skin, subject to considerable variation no doubt. This sounds a little low but the definition of skin sort of forces this--it is only skin-deep.  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/work-done-by-the-human-heart/\" rel=\"nofollow\">One source<\/a> gives an estimate of the energy expended to pump blood in a normal adult heart as <a href=\"http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/work-done-by-the-human-heart/\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.5-1.0 Joule per beat<\/a> which at 70 beats/minute amounts to 100.8 kJ/day using 1 Joule.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the heart is handling about 5 L of blood of which 0.3188 L is blood in skin, so very roughly we could estimate that $0.3188/5 = 0.0638$ or 6.38% of the work above goes toward supplying skin, i.e. 6.43 kJ/day of energy. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a sanity check, if someone burns 1200 [nutritional] calories a day, which is about 5 MJ, we can see that keeping skin supplied with blood represents a small fraction of daily energy expenditure.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The title question<\/strong>: Like you, I found no study on point but that does not mean one does not exist. I can't see why anyone would do/fund such a study as the answer is unlikely to inform further work, answer any current questions, or solve any problems.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The last part of your second question (ii)<\/strong> Transporting blood to the capillaries and circulating the blood through capillaries are aspects of the same job.

Lynn and Vanhanen present four separate IQ studies from the former West Germany, all quite sizable, which indicate mean IQs in the range 99\u2013107, with the oldest 1970 sample providing the low end of that range. Meanwhile, a 1967 sample of East German children produced a score of just 90, while two later East German studies in 1978 and 1984 came in at 97\u201399, much closer to the West German numbers.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>These results seem anomalous from the perspective of strong genetic determinism for IQ. To a very good approximation, East Germans and West Germans are genetically indistinguishable, and an IQ gap as wide as 17 points between the two groups seems inexplicable, while the recorded rise in East German scores of 7\u20139 points in just half a generation seems even more difficult to explain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-east-asian-exception-to-socio-economic-iq-influences/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The East Asian Exception to Socio-Economic IQ Influences<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Myth of American Meritocracy<\/a> (on how ethnicity can affect admission) by the same author.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19091,"question_id":19083,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1402663172}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19083/is-there-any-measure-by-which-the-germans-today-could-be-called-a-genetically-su","last_activity_date":1402669033,"creation_date":1402643583,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there any measure by which the Germans today could be called a genetically superior race?","body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nazi eugenics<\/a> programs are well known.

The \".632 rule\" in statistics says roughly that as we approach n random samples from a large population of size n we will see only about 62.3 per cent of the population. After a point we would begin to see the same viruses again and again. This argument is probably stronger with respect to marine viruses, as they may be even more numerous and sampling at depths could be difficult. <\/p>\n\n<p>I wonder if someone with experience sampling small organisms from large populations or familiarity with the literature has an idea about the plausibility of seeing 85% of a large population, such as mammalian viruses, by sampling? <\/p>\n\n<p>If the samples are really random (in some sense) and the population is large, a few computer simulations reveal the power of this rule of thumb.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit in response to comment/question:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Like any such estimate, the blog's estimate of 3.6 million is a guess.

As the blog notes, the PCR approach detects viruses similar to those we know, so the sampling is worse than random. If we look at the difficulty of finding/using a method that has a reasonable chance of capturing any of the extant viruses, the number 3.6 million looks very big. <\/p>\n","question_id":17957,"tags":["virology","population-biology"],"score":6,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":109,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1402233963},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/157fc3cbff8a7b17d31d02a84547fdc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6534,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6534/coburne","reputation":216,"display_name":"coburne","accept_rate":83},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":19073,"edited":false,"creation_date":1402663752,"comment_id":27031,"body":"Can you please give your definition of symbiotic relationship?

The antigen binding sites are located on the ends of the two short arms of the Y-shaped molecule, as seen in the figure below:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pi7lI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The recognition site is made of the ends of one short immunoglobulin chain and one long chain. The ends (shown in yellow in the figure) are also called variable regions and are the key to the big variety of different antibodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>When B cells develop, there B cell receptor (which is basically a membrane bound antibody) is tested if it reacts to components from the own organism. If not, they are released into the periphery (blood stream). These B cells are then called naive, since they haven't come in contact with an antigen. They express a B cell receptor which usually only has a weak affinity to an antigen - but the body produces quite a wide variety of these cells. (see the second figure).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zBeFc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>When the body comes in contact with an antigen (like a virus), it is taken up by the so called professional antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells) of the immune system, broken down into small pieces and these are presented to the immune system. This activates the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation\" rel=\"nofollow\">affinity maturation<\/a> of the B cell receptor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation\" rel=\"nofollow\">somatic hypermutation<\/a> and finally the clonal selection of the cells, which produce the antibodies with the highest affinity (the strongest binding) to the antigen. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are estimates that the human immune system can produce around 10 billion different antibodies. This variability is achieved by the genetic variability of the mutation of the variable region of the antibody (the whole process is nicely explained <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>For further information on this topic I can recommend reading the following articles:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8612345\" rel=\"nofollow\">Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9875841\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immune receptor editing: revise and select.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The reaction of the body afterwards is always the same, as you state yourself. The specificity of the adaptive immune response is \"only\" mediated by the specificity of the antibodies. This also makes the system very strong against new pathogens, since only one part of the system needs to be adapted, while the cascades behind it (like apoptosis) are always the same and can be activated fastly if needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can cause some problems, too. Think about self-antibodies, which occur in autoimmune diseases. Here the body can not distinguish between a legitimate immune response against a foreign antigen and those, which are from the own body.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19085,"question_id":19076,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19076/how-specific-is-the-adaptive-immune-response","last_activity_date":1402650534,"creation_date":1402615866,"answer_count":1,"title":"How specific is the adaptive immune response?","body":"<p>When you read about the adaptive immune response, you are often told that the response is specific to each pathogen - that the response is tailored. My question is - to what extent is this really true? And if it is true, how is the response tailored?<\/p>\n\n<p>I understand that the B cell receptors (and, consequently, the antibodies produced by plasma cells in response to a pathogen) are highly specific. A pathogen will bind specifically to a B cell receptor on a particular B cell and particular antibodies will be produced for that pathogen. Again, T cells are specific for each pathogen.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, it strikes me that there doesn't seem to be that much variation in what antibodies do. Each antibody is particular to its pathogen, but all antibodies work by doing the same few things, e.g. opsonisation, or inhibiting viruses from infiltrating cells. Yes the antibodies may be specific, but to what extent is it true that the antibody will produce a specific response to a specific pathogen? I mean, does the antibody for staphylococcus affect staphylococcus differently from the way the antibody for listeria affects listeria?<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, each CD8+ Tc cell is specific to its pathogen, but they then seem to go about killing their target pathogen in very similar ways - inducing apoptosis or lysis via perforin and various cytotoxins.

For example, it has been shown in I don't remember which species of birds (I can't find the reference) that each individual align their movement according to only the 6th closest neighbors.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the 3 basic rules (separation, alignment, cohesion) that allow swarming behavior, have a look to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki page<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In short, I hypothesize that thanks to the underlying 3 basic rules of swarming, the patterns of rotations and inertia together allow to explain your observations.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19082,"question_id":19077,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19077/is-there-a-good-explanation-for-this-swarming-pattern","last_activity_date":1402643019,"creation_date":1402623392,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there a good explanation for this swarming pattern?","body":"<p>A film clip would be helpful here.

If the filter becomes clogged with particles, remove the used filter, replace with a clean filter and continue pouring the broth.<\/p>\n\n<p>3\nRemove the strainer and filter from the top of the bowl and observe whether the broth appears clear (i.e., there are no suspended particles in the liquid). If particles are floating in the liquid, repeat Steps 1 and 2 using a second clear bowl and a fresh coffee filter.<\/p>\n\n<p>4\nPlace the pot on the stove and pour the clear broth into the pot.<\/p>\n\n<p>5\nAdd 16 ounces of distilled water to the pot containing the broth.<\/p>\n\n<p>6\nTurn on the stove and adjust the heat to medium-low. Heat the broth to a simmer (i.e., small bubbles appear near the side of the pot).<\/p>\n\n<p>7\nAdd 1 teaspoon of the agar-agar powder to the simmering broth (approximately 2.5 grams) and stir the mixture until the powder is dissolved. Make sure to stir the powder to dissolve and prevent the gelatin from sinking to the bottom of the pot (where it can burn).<\/p>\n\n<p>8\nRepeat Step 7 until all agar-agar powder has been dissolved in the broth.<\/p>\n\n<p>9\nContinue stirring the broth for about 1 minute to ensure that all powder is completely dissolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>10\nTurn off the stove, place the lid on the pot and let the liquid cool for at least 15 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>11\nArrange the sterile petri dishes in a row for easy assembly, but do not remove the lids.If desired, place a trivet to hold the warm pot. If you're using lidded custard cups instead of petri dishes, sterilize the custard cups by placing the cups and lids inverted (upside down) on a foil-covered cookie sheet and bake in the oven for at least one hour at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure the sterilized cups and lids are completely cooled before use.<\/p>\n\n<p>12\nCarefully touch the outside of the pot to check that it is warm to the touch and place the pot on the trivet. If the pot is too hot to touch, wait at least 10 minutes to let the pot cool.<\/p>\n\n<p>13\nRemove the lid and set aside. Place the ladle in the pot.<\/p>\n\n<p>14\nRemove the lid from one petri dish and dispense nutrient broth to fill the dish halfway. Cover the dish immediately with its cover.<\/p>\n\n<p>15\nRepeat Step 14 for each of the petri dishes.<\/p>\n\n<p>16\nAllow the nutrient broth to solidify in the petri dishes for at least 1 hour, undisturbed.<\/p>\n\n<p>17\nGently shake the petri dishes side to side to check that the nutrient broth has completely solidified. If the broth is not completely gelled, wait another 20 minutes before checking again.<\/p>\n\n<p>18\nCover a table or flat surface with a roll of paper towels to create a sterile work area. Tear off a sheet of paper towel and fold it four times to create a thick, rectangular wad. Set this wad on one end of the work area.<\/p>\n\n<p>19\nTransfer one petri dish to the sterile work area and remove the lid. Carefully turn the dish over and place one end on the side of the folded wad, so that it lies inverted and slightly angled (with a slight gap by the paper towel wad).<\/p>\n\n<p>20\nTurn the lid over and place it above the petri dish on the sterile work surface. If water droplets appear on the lid, gently shake this moisture off before placing on the covered surface, but do not touch the inside of the lid.<\/p>\n\n<p>21\nRepeat Steps 19 and 20 for each petri dish, positioning one side of the inverted dish on the side of the previous dish rather than the paper towel wad. The dishes will appear as a staggered set, with gaps on one side so that excess moisture can evaporate.<\/p>\n\n<p>22\nLook at the inverted petri dishes to check whether the moisture on the sides of the plates evaporated. Once all moisture has cleared, turn the plates right-side up and immediately cover with the lids for use.<\/p>\n\n<p>23\nInoculate the nutrient agar on the plate by wiping a swab containing the desired culture on the nutrient agar surface before covering with the lid. Turn the petri dish over so that the solid is on top. Store the inoculated petri dish with the solid on top for culturing and the lid on the bottom to catch any moisture, loose particles or growth.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19063,"question_id":19057,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19057/science-experiments-at-home-with-minimal-cost","last_activity_date":1402568634,"creation_date":1402529522,"answer_count":1,"title":"Science experiments at home with Minimal Cost","body":"<p>What is a good recipe for making agar at home for a minimal cost?

For example, energy aside, maybe the growth of wings relies on some special nutrients, which were scarce in the environment of the first ancestors of modern ants. So the ant colonies that grew smaller wings (or no wing at all) thrived.<\/p>\n\n<p>Having wings could also cost them their lives. Maybe the workers in ancestor colonies used to be small and had a tendency to get stuck in spider webs (not having enough in-flight momentum or brute strength to break off the web), and somehow the queens and drones are less affected (because they don't tend to go to the same places as the workers to begin with, maybe; but that's unlikely: I see plenty of queens stuck in spider webs in Hong Kong in the mating season).<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, I believe the nutrient-driven path is quite likely. When you think about it, there is a <em>huge<\/em> behavioural component to this trait. If I remember correctly, all female ants are equal at birth. Whether a certain female becomes a worker, a soldier, or a queen depends on what it is fed as it develops. So the scenario could be that some ancestor colonies arrived in a place that didn't have an abundance in nutrients for wings. Some of those colonies tended to reserve the said nutrients to the reproductive casts (queens and drones), and this strategy proved successful, so the trait got amplified over time. So it becomes a matter of <em>less<\/em> wings, not <em>smaller<\/em> wings.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3091,"question_id":3050,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1343871868},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a37a096cfb6f7b8e40e4950dc1a9658?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1156,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1156/oldcurmudgeon","reputation":217,"display_name":"OldCurmudgeon"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33af7b8879cdcdfdb5edb7b1f265fd9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":430,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/430/richard-smith-unna","reputation":7703,"display_name":"Richard Smith-Unna","accept_rate":90},"score":0,"post_id":3106,"edited":false,"creation_date":1343991997,"comment_id":4607,"body":"It could easily be good to have wings when under attack - if you can fly away from a conflict that&#39;s a whole extra dimension of escape routes compared to those available to a flightless animal."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e75d4a95cbb4cfed0c0efc18fd6aa470?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":445,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/445/stephunna","reputation":1464,"display_name":"StephUnna"},"score":0,"post_id":3106,"edited":false,"creation_date":1343992066,"comment_id":4608,"body":"Many smaller winged insects use the wind to aid dispersal, see <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00173138109427667\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a> for example.

Then <strong>W-A-<\/strong> and <strong>W-aa<\/strong> would have a white phenotype, <strong>wwA-<\/strong> would have a red phenotype, and <strong>wwaa<\/strong> would have a yellow phenotype.  This would be consistent with the ratios provided in the problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to explain the 9 red : 3 yellow : 4 white, a third locus can be considered with alleles <strong>B<\/strong> and <strong>b<\/strong>.  Proceeding as above, where we had the locus for <strong>W<\/strong> or <strong>w<\/strong> epistatic with respect to the locus for <strong>A<\/strong> and <strong>a<\/strong>, we could have the same locus for <strong>W<\/strong> or <strong>w<\/strong> epistatic with respect to the locus for <strong>B<\/strong> and <strong>b<\/strong>.  This time, <strong>wwB-<\/strong> and <strong>wwbb<\/strong> would be white, <strong>W-B-<\/strong> would be red, and <strong>W-bb<\/strong> would be yellow.  This would be consistent with the 9 red : 3 yellow : 4 white ratio.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where I get stuck.  If the locus for <strong>W<\/strong> and <strong>w<\/strong> is epistatic in a dominant way with respect to one locus and in a recessive way with respect to another locus, then all onions would be white.  Therefore, I must have done something wrong.  Am I on the right track?<\/p>\n\n<p>This isn't really a homework problem, despite the \"homework\" tag.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the answers provided in the text for the problem:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Problem 4.30 (pg. 115):  (a) 25% (b) F$_1$: all white; F$_2$ : 52\n  white : 9 red : 3 yellow<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","question_id":17895,"tags":["genetics","homework"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":17950,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":270,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1402072224}]}
