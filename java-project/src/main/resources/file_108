After cellulose, chitin is the most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chitin is a polysaccharide consisting of multiple units of N-acetylglucosamine (N-acetyl-D-glucos-2-amine) linked together with a bond-type β-1, 4, of the same glucose units forming the cellulose. Therefore, the the chitin can be regarded as a cellulose in which the hydroxyl group on each monomer has been replaced a group of acetilammina.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pepsin in the stomach cleaves peptide bonds that bind together the amino acids of proteins, thus forming small peptides and amino fragments. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>From the organoleptic point of view, chitin is considered a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiber<\/a>, like cellulose and chitosans, suggesting it is indigestible.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Some herbivores, such as goats and some ruminants can digest cellulose, breaking them down long chains of polysaccharides. <strong>Similarly, <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroidea\" rel=\"nofollow\">echinoderms<\/a> can eat shellfish, sea urchins and mussels and digest chitin, breaking mechanically only ones with hard shells.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, hydrogen bonds between adjacent polymer guarantee the substance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin\" rel=\"nofollow\">a remarkable hardness<\/a>.

To start you off with some broad strokes, there are two main approaches to evolutionary modeling with their own communities: frequency-independent and frequency-dependent models. Of course, in a real biological setting, the truth lies somewhere in between, but models are idealizations of key principles, and so the two extremes are good to study.<\/p>\n\n<p>For frequency-independent selection, they key concept is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape\">fitness landscape<\/a> -- a way to map each genotype to a fitness. The population then lives in this landscape and agents with higher fitness reproduce better and so the population slowly movers over the lattice. Under reasonable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroevolution\">macroevolutionary<\/a> assumptions such as very rare mutations and asexual populations, the population will tend to be homogenous and can be just modeled as a single point in the fitness landscape with <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/2638/500\">properly chosen selective sweeps<\/a> to move the point from vertex to vertx (Gillespie, 1983; 1984). <\/p>\n\n<p>The most popular concrete approach for frequency-independent selection is [Kauffman's NK model of rugged fitness landscapes] (Kauffman &amp; Weinberger, 1989; Kauffman, 1993).

By the concentration of different cyclins and CDKs. They are produced all the time, in amounts dependent on the general availability of nutrients, but they are used at different times. Some are used during DNA synthesis, so that if they are present, the cell \"knows\" that there is not enough DNA to divide itself; others are used during cell division, so a freshly divided cell \"knows\" that there is a long period before next division. How do our hairs grow at seemingly same intervals? Because their location was decided on the basis of concentrations of certain proteins or small molecules when skin was just being formed (I don't have Developmental Biology right here, so no protein names, sorry).<\/p>\n\n<p>The menstrual cycle is regulated by the concentration of the hormones and ovulation triggers changes leading to menstruation. That's why menstruation happens 14 days after ovulation and not just 28 days after the previous one - if a woman has a 30 day-long cycle, her ovulation will be on 16th day of the cycle. Menopause generally happens when the supply of eggs ends and they stop providing cues about the proper time for menstruation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cues about puberty and aging may be more subtle. One well-known cause of aging is the shrinking of the telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. Cells with short telomeres can't divide. Too low of a \"concentration\" of these telomeres \"tells\" the cell that it is old.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another well known fact - malnourished girls don't go through puberty and malnourished women stop ovulating. Low food \"concentration\" is a sign of a bad time to burden your body with nourishing and feeding a baby.<\/p>\n\n<p>Detailed mechanisms behind those processes are often different, but the general rule is the same: each process has threshold(s) for certain chemicals; if they are exceeded, the organism reacts.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3603,"question_id":3590,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1348195132},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1348088241,"creation_date":1348081075,"body":"<p>The short answer is: we do not know exactly, although we do have some insights.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will take the example of puberty.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although a clear definition of puberty is lacking, it is quite clear that it corresponds to a period where gonadal function starts.<\/p>\n\n<p>This, in turn, is derived from the activation of the gonadotropin system, which consists of two main cell types:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a small number of neurons located in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (a nucleus at the base of the brain) called the GnRH neurons. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone\" rel=\"nofollow\">GnRH<\/a> is the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a small peptide that stimulates the production of gonadotropins from the pituitary.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotroph\" rel=\"nofollow\">gonadotrophs<\/a>, a specialised group of cells in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_pituitary\" rel=\"nofollow\">pituitary<\/a> (a gland located underneath the brain) which produce two hormones, called luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which stimulate the gonads to produce various hormones, such as estrogen.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In mammals, the secretion of GnRH, and thus LH/FSH varies during the course of the menstrual/estral cycle. This cyclicity lasts several days (4-5 days in rodents, ~1 month in humans) and entrains the cyclical secretion of estradiol (E2) from the gonads.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this is a sort of self-sustaining cycle, as cyclic levels of E2 will then allow for cyclic GnRH secretion and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, back to your question: how does the GnRH/LH/E2 system \"wake up\" at puberty?<\/p>\n\n<p>The exact mechanism is still unknown, but recent work has found an important mediator, called kisspeptin, that is produced from two population of neurons in the hypothalamus, called the kisspeptin neurons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kisspeptin has been shown to be a very potent activator of GnRH neurons and work in the mouse has shown that these neurons appear at the time of puberty, their number increasing dramatically between 25 and 31 days (puberty is at around 30 days in mice).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16959837\" rel=\"nofollow\">Postnatal Development of Kisspeptin Neurons in Mouse Hypothalamus; Sexual Dimorphism and Projections to Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons <\/a> - Clarkson and Herbison - <em>Endocrinology<\/em>, <strong>2006<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Similar work exist in the monkey:\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15684075\" rel=\"nofollow\">Increased hypothalamic GPR54 signaling: A potential mechanism for initiation of puberty in primates<\/a> - Shahab et al. - <em>PNAS<\/em>, <strong>2005<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In humans mutations in either kisspeptin, or its cognate receptor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiSS1-derived_peptide_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">GPR54<\/a> results in disturbances of pubertal maturation because of underactivation of the system (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) or hyperactivation (precocious puberty).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, now the question is shifted: why do kisspeptin neurons show up only at puberty? We don't know for sure, but it looks like increased levels of E2 could be important for this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, we get into a self-sustaining cycle. Growth of the body generates an increase in E2 production (possibly due to increased volume of the gonads?), which, when over a certain level permits the development of kisspeptin neurons, which will then stimulate the GnRH neurons, resulting in increased LH and E2. We then have more E2 and this makes kisspeptin neuron grow even more etc etc.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703539/bin/zee0070948160006.jpg\" alt=\"Kisspeptin system maturation\"><br>\nFrom: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19299459\" rel=\"nofollow\">Postnatal development of an estradiol-kisspeptin positive feedback mechanism implicated in puberty onset.<\/a> - Clarkson et al. - <em>Endocrinology<\/em>, <strong>2009<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":3609,"question_id":3590,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1348088241},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aab80aeaf4754dee5d4a758db50e7213?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":460,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/460/memming","reputation":2145,"display_name":"Memming","accept_rate":70},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54a82fba3ce9f146c47e561b973f6adf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5851,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5851/caters","reputation":341,"display_name":"Caters","accept_rate":36},"score":0,"post_id":7926,"edited":false,"creation_date":1407003260,"comment_id":30198,"body":"I have heard of a case where a 5 year old got pregnant.

More importantly, an epigenetic regulator provides the perfect interface for coordinating the genetic and environmental influences that are known to buffet this process.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is just one piece of the puzzle as the title of the news article says, and there are still a lot of gaps in our understanding.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lomniczi, A. et al.

But the largest %GC in genomes are found in thermophiles - organisms which live in high temperature water - in hotsprings and undersea geothermal vents. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/gb-2004-5-10-117.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This review<\/a> mentions how some thermophiles can be found with 50% GC.  The extreme thermophile <em><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n5/abs/nbt956.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermus thermophilus<\/a><\/em> can have a GC% content of 69.4%.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But you are asking <em>how<\/em> does GC content get averaged out over the length of a large genome.  The answer is variation and selection.  When a gene needs to be more stable because of genomic function or because its trying to live in a hotter environment mutations that convert A/T to G/C base pairs will convey an incremental advantage to survival and will tend to be retained in the gene pool as long as no greater disadvantage to the mutation results.  Over time and as the stability creates a greater advantage, GC % will migrate further and further away from the mean. <\/p>\n\n<p>This works for both thermo-tolerance and because of the biofunctional constraints of being a telomere, centromere or a coding region - stability and coding constraints play against each other to converge on an optimal GC content in any given stretch of the genome.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Conversely most genomes have a GC content below 50% are migrating there because too much stability can have a cost as well.  Breaking up the DNA helix for transcription and other cellular processes must go smoothly as well for example.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Coding regions are significant for bacteria (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21120/#A5531\" rel=\"nofollow\">E coli is 89% coding sequence<\/a>).  For coding sequences, the genetic code is logically 50% GC on the average, but if you look at the actual codons in the diagram below you will see that except in the case of a single codon case (tryptophan, methionine) the third base always has a GC option, allowing for a GC content in the mid 60 percentiles.  The constraint of allowing coding sequences to freely vary is only an approximation - in some cases substitutions to amino acids with GC rich codons might move the cieling up a bit. And the more frequent amino acids have the possibility of making 2 or 3 bases of their codon GC bases.  Overall it would be remarkable to find a bacteria with GC% greater than 72%.  Mutations and the requirements of proteins being coded for would simply not allow it. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2AMNW.jpg\" alt=\"genetic code\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So: over evolutionary periods these GC mutations accumulate where they are helpful, even to the extent of 2/3 of the genome being GC pairs.  The strongest selective force to accumulate a high average GC% for a genome is exposure of the genome itself to a high temperature environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this thermo-stability argument doesn't count for many animals because they do regulate their body temperatures.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":7513,"question_id":7378,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1365881406}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7378/chromosomes-are-of-different-size-but-why-do-all-chromosomes-have-similar-gc-per","last_activity_date":1365881406,"creation_date":1362013079,"answer_count":4,"title":"Chromosomes are of different size but why do all chromosomes have similar GC percentage?","body":"<p>When I browsed NCBI I saw a pattern: even if the chromosome sizes, number of genes, and number of proteins are different, GC% in chromosomes tend to be similar.

So that's at the single-muscle-fiber scale. The muscle itself continues to work at all (thawed) temperatures below body temperature -- the problem comes with its regulation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering\">shivering response<\/a> -- a centrally controlled  involuntary contractile pattern -- overwhelms voluntary muscle control. So <strong>the mechanism behind loss of muscle coordination in hypothermia is the same as the shivering mechanism.<\/strong> When the core temperature drops, the midbrain starts over-riding voluntary control of the muscles. When the core temperature drops far enough; <a href=\"http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/5975/SPUMS_V28N3Supl_10.pdf?sequence=1\">around 32C<\/a>, the shivering often slows down or stops. Voluntary movement becomes compromised probably because the brain simply isn't working; neuron firing rates are so slow that sensation, processing, and motor responses are all critically impaired. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <em>feeling<\/em> of numbness does not actually directly accompany a loss of muscle contractility. You can walk pretty much indefinitely on frozen feet if you can keep your balance (and you keep your core temperature up.) Lots of people survive severe frostbite of their feet (their feet do not often survive, however.) The reason why it <em>seems<\/em> your hands don't work when they get cold is that you can't feel what you're doing (note; your hands can be <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013\">much colder<\/a> than your core body temperature.)

It's interesting that they review results suggesting that some of this effect is intrinsic to the muscle fiber (not neurological), showing that I should refine what is meant by \"continuing to work\" in my opening paragraph. (I meant having an ability to generate contractile force when equilibrated in solution containing sufficient ATP and Ca$^{2+}$, not the ability to contract optimally.)

The average American will eat roughly <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/12/31/144478009/the-average-american-ate-literally-a-ton-this-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">5.4lbs of food per day<\/a> - or roughly 2lbs of food per meal. Given that even raw food is at room temperature, the metabolic requirements to warm food you've eaten is negligible.<\/p>\n\n<p>What's important is acidity and exposure. Food is generally broken apart and utilized by catalysts and proteins which have specific operating boundaries - which is why your stomach contents is acidic. However, your normal meals will not significantly alter your digestive capabilities either via pKa values or thermoregulation requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>What cooking <em>can<\/em> do is denature the raw food's proteins or compounds so as to make the usable energy sources more readily available. However, it can also just as easily destroy them (the 'char' on barbequed steaks is the meat exposed to high heat long enough to destroy almost everything but the carbon in the tissue). Whether a food gains or loses macronutrients depends upon the specific food and its preparation. A good example is potatoes, which are full of starch (sugars) in their natural state. However, french fries / frites / chips are often blanched before they're fried. The blanching dissolves much of the starch into water, leaving fewer sugars in the end product. However, the process of frying essentially adds fat to the food, and fats have a higher energy density than sugars so you have a net gain in caloric content.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>mechanical : the food may become easier to chew, absorb, conduct in the digestive tract, leading to less muscular force used.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For some foods, this is true. Steaming vegetables often makes them easier to chew/eat. The broth of stews and soups often contains micelles of fat and dissolved sugars, affording them greater and faster exposure to the digestive system. Keep in mind, you are <strong>not<\/strong> getting a net gain of caloric content from food by doing so, but merely reducing the time to utilization.<\/p>\n\n<p>The calories saved by chewing less is going to be pathetically small, so to amend the previous paragraph: Yes, for some foods it's true that cooking will allow easier mastication and thus save energy. However, an extra chocolate chip or sip of spoon of rice could easily cover the energy spared. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The cooking procedure may involve water immersion, and the water may penetrate the food and improve all three energetic aspects outline above.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If the energy source is water-soluble (that is: <em>alcohols, ketones, and sugars<\/em>) then water immersion - <em>assuming you are also digesting the water solution after<\/em> - will offer <strong>faster<\/strong> utilization, not necessarily more.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But what are the respective scale of these advantages, compared to the Joule intake of the raw food? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Negligible in almost all cases. What cooking does is make things more palatable, has the potential to make micronutrients/vitamins more available (<em>not<\/em> macronutrients), and make the food edible in the first place as is the case with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro#Toxicity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taro plants, whose roots must be cooked in order to eat.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Focusing on meat, for instance, is there an optimal cooking duration/temperature and eating temperature for human eaters, independently of personal tastes, for say, beef or chicken meat?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No. Cooking meat makes it <em>safer<\/em> to eat (unless you end up overcooking the meat and end up with a bunch of charred bone) and more palatable. Properly cooked meat has a very low chance of passing on parasites or other harmful organisms. Beyond that, there aren't compelling reasons to expose meat to heat - although as someone who's picked up stomach flus in his travels, it is a <strong>very<\/strong> compelling reason to do so.<\/p>\n\n<p>*The above is based mostly on sporadically gained knowledge.

Since you don't know programming, I've outlined what the code is doing, beyond the simple operations (+, -, /, *, ^), to get you started.  I think you should be able to implement the models with this information, and I'd be happy to confirm your own answers. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So the best way to figure out what any line of code means, in any language, is to type it and see what happens. To help you get started with programming in MATLAB:<\/p>\n\n<p>Any text following a % (on the same line) is a comment: it does nothing in the program, and is only there for you to write notes to yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first two sections, Time-Related Constants and Simulation Constants, are just setting variables. It's like saying x = 3, so that later on you can do other operations with x.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The semicolon at the end of a line (in MATLAB) suppresses the output of the line. See what happens if you type <code>x = 3;<\/code> versus <code>x = 3<\/code> at the command prompt.<\/p>\n\n<p>In iteration constants, <code>length<\/code> is just a function that tells you the length of the vector.  <code>X_rna_0<\/code> was previously initialized to go from 0 to 1.4 in steps of 0.2: the syntax is vector_name = start:step:end.<\/p>\n\n<p>The simulation variables section is creating xyz-matrices, with all values initialized to zero.  The length in x is xr_max, and so on.  The idea is that, later on, at each step in Euler's method and each value of xr_max and xp_max, you'll save the value of X_rna.<\/p>\n\n<p>The initial conditions are being set using <code>meshgrid<\/code>, which is best explained <a href=\"http://www.weizmann.ac.il/matlab/techdoc/ref/meshgrid.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.  The <code>:<\/code> means all of the rows/columns, corresponding to position: say you had a 3 x 3 matrix called <code>apple<\/code>.  <code>apple[:,1]<\/code>  gives you all the first column (1) of all three rows.  <code>apple[1,:]<\/code> gives you the first row (1) of all three columns. The .' means that the matrix is being transposed: again, the best way to see what's going on is to create a matrix of your own, perform the operation, and see if what you get is what you thought it would be.<\/p>\n\n<p>For loops, you can read about <a href=\"http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/matlab/control.html#for\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>, for a start.  I do not think understanding this loop requires more information than that page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dot before ^2 means that each element of the matrix is being squared; you are not multiplying the matrix by itself. <\/p>\n\n<p>That should decipher most of the code for you.  If you have further questions, feel free to comment here.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Question 2 asks you to make a plot.  A plot of y vs. x would be made by typing <code>plot(x,y)<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>Also, help on a particular MATLAB function can be accessed by typing <code>help name_of_function<\/code>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":7872,"question_id":7870,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1365763452,"creation_date":1365740199,"body":"<p>This is a set of ordinary differential equations.

Fragmentation allows you to study finer details. It is also essential for de-novo peptide sequencing. Different fragmentation techniques, such as Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) or Photofragmentation, yield different kinds of secondary ions. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can intuitively understand that Fragmentation of structural isomers will yield different kinds of secondary ions (using the same fragmentation technique). The choice of fragmentation technique depends on the molecular nature of the analyte.

One possibility is that those which lived are genetically resistant (their DNA is different). To see if this is the case, you take those which lived and treat them again with the antibiotic. If they all live, they are resistant. Another possibility is that they are scholastically resistant. This phenomenon is known as bacterial persistence. What happens is that there is a genetic switch that randomly bestows resistance in some fraction of the population, let's say 10 percent. If you now take this population and reapply the antibiotic, only 10% of the population will survive. This interesting mechanism allows the bacteria adapt more quickly, since they do not have to make modifications to their DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am guessing that if the bacteria are genetically resistant, they will stay resistant.

It also adds to motivation and tends to confer some other advantages such as a decreased rate of suicide due to the condemnation of suicide by the majority of religions. <\/p>\n","question_id":7787,"tags":["evolution"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":1,"closed_reason":"not constructive","is_answered":true,"view_count":183,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56114ec7135734d99751399f541c7ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1836,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1836/james","reputation":56,"display_name":"James"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnYni.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1916,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1916/mysky","reputation":1053,"display_name":"MySky","accept_rate":76},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnYni.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1916,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1916/mysky","reputation":1053,"display_name":"MySky","accept_rate":76},"score":0,"post_id":6910,"edited":false,"creation_date":1358954992,"comment_id":8445,"body":"Notice: Some of non crop GMOs also have commercial purposes but they didnt&#39;t release to environment and are restricted to laboratories."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a56114ec7135734d99751399f541c7ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1836,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1836/james","reputation":56,"display_name":"James"},"score":0,"post_id":6910,"edited":false,"creation_date":1358978036,"comment_id":8449,"body":"Increased yield and higher resistance to pathogens and physiological problems don&#39;t seem like they must necessarily increase fitness in the wild.

An example could be sudden depletion of SNAREs (required for vesicle fusion in neurotransmitter exocytosis) caused by botulinum toxin.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is, does the terminal somehow report back to the soma in any way if a certain protein needs to be made available more or less? And if so, how? Especially considering that retrograde transport, according to Wikipedia, gets up to 200mm/day only.

You create a sphere the diameter of the <a href=\"http://jmol.sourceforge.net/docs/surface/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VdW radius of water, and then 'roll' it along the surface<\/a>.  I know this as a Richards-Lee surface, wikipedia has another name for it. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pBANE.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This looks complicated, but its not.  you move the probe sphere along the surface of the molecule in the XY plane until it just touches the vdW radius of the protein, keeping the center of the sphere as the surface, all the way around the molecule.  If you like, you can color the surface by the charge of the position too, which is useful for discussing solvent interactions. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then you translate along the z axis and do another contour until you run out of protein.  Apparently jmol and other packages will do this for you. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessible_surface_area#Methods_of_calculating_ASA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia references a more mathematical method LCPO<\/a>, which I am not so familiar with.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this accurate?  As usual with such calculations its more of a guess than an answer.  You can do the calculation on any structure or any ensemble of structures (like NMR gives).  It doesn't understand how the molecule might be flexible or dynamic.  If you read up on your physical chemistry you see that proteins breathe and can allow diffusion into the core rather readily.  If I recall right, you can get rather large molecules quenching heme flouresence in hemoglobin at room temperature.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are looking to dock 2 proteins, SAS might be more useful.  Its an important piece of information, but not an ultimate answer.  I'm afraid with proteins that doesn't happen so easily. <\/p>\n\n<p>@bobthejoe asked about SAS for which no structure exists.<br>\nThis is an extremely difficult thing to even guess at.  The non helpful answer is that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v277/n5696/pdf/277491a0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the surface of the protein goes as the cube root of the molecular weight of the protein<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>By getting a solution of the protein and shooting it in a syhcrotron, you can get a mean radius of gyration pretty easily which will give you an ellipsoidal volume (and surface area) for a protein.  Again most of the particulars would be lost and this could easily be off by 25% for an irregularly shaped protein.  For a regular globular protein it might give an answer similar to the power law above.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I have seen physical chemistry experiments that look for changes in osmotic pressure when the salt concentration in a solution of the protein changes substantially (Adrian Parsegian's work at NIH in the late 80s).   <\/p>\n\n<p>I doubt you will find any of these answers useful as their mean error is going to be very large (20-200%) and also assumes the protein is soluable and amenable to the experimental conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>Solvent probes can help too.  For instance exposing the protein to D20 then doing mass spectroscopy on the protein. This is still only going to give you a general idea of how much of the peptide is surface exposed.

I don't doubt you, I've just never read up on this particular aspect of cancer. Be that as it may, there is a difference between a cell's expressing high levels of sialoglycoproteins overall, and inducing high sialylation of one protein in particular, in this case EGFR. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you may be aware, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor#Function\" rel=\"nofollow\">EGFR dimerization<\/a> induced by multiple methods, including EGF binding, overexpression, mutation, chemical or antibody crosslinking, etc. activates <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase\" rel=\"nofollow\">tyrosine kinase<\/a> domains in its intracellular region to auto-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation\" rel=\"nofollow\">phosphorylate<\/a> specific Tyr residues in its tail, which then recruit adapter and scaffolding proteins which support downstream <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">signal transduction<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The paper you read shows how increasing sialylation of EGFR reduces its <em>trans<\/em>-affinity for itself and inhibits dimerization, and hence the downstream signaling cascade. This is a good thing in certain types of cancer which are driven by aberrant EGFR signaling, whether through overexpression of EGF and/or EGFR, mutations in the kinase domains, mutations in the dimerization domains, or otherwise.<\/p>\n\n<p>This paper is also a great example of an apparent bad thing turning out to be good, when properly targeted and controlled. Excess sialylation of a cell may be bad, but specific over-sialylation of EGFR could turn out to be very useful, if we can learn how to modulate and target it. Another common example of this phenomenon is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">radiation therapy<\/a>. Normally, high levels of radiation are bad for your body, and can actually cause cancer, among a range of other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_sickness\" rel=\"nofollow\">illnesses<\/a>.

Many sources distinguish only prokaryotes and eukaryotes, subdividing prokaryotes into bacteria and archaea. Other sources posit archaea as a third domain on the highest level. That's a long debate though and fortunately not the topic here.<\/p>\n\n<p>By appearance, the dual-domain system makes more sense because archaea and bacteria look very much alike under a microscope, and can both be clearly distinguished from eukaryotes (which have membrane bound nuclei). At the same time, comparing genetic structure and the protein machinery that interacts with DNA, eukaryotes and archaea are very similar and bacteria are clearly different from both of them. This demonstrates how appearance and molecular organisation have been typical criteria for distinction between branches of the evolutionary tree.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are, however, many features that even those three most basic branches of life share, and they are in no way simple or few in number. For example, all extant life uses DNA to store genetic information and proteins for almost all processes governing the various reactions going on at any time in a cell. However, RNA for example is able to perform both the information storing function of DNA as well as the catalytic functions of protein.

The fetus does however require help in removing the toxic cholephilic organic anions (COAs), which is done via the placenta. <a href=\"http://www.annalsofhepatology.com/PDF/vol4n2/Hp052-02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This<\/a> review describes more.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1963.tb36958.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">evidence<\/a> to suggest the newborn's liver is not performing all the usual metabolic processes of children or adults (from looking at drug toxicity and delays in excretion/detoxification), as would be expected. More <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10665839\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent literature<\/a> notes the fetal liver lobes (right and left) as having differnt biochemical capacities and independent function due to the right one getting less oxygen. Also, a layer of drug metabolising enzymes normally present in adults is missing in the fetal liver, although its capacity for drug metabolism is still better than that of rodents.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the adult liver, there is a clear zonation of metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and bile salts. In the livers of fetal rats, mice, and humans, this heterogeneous distribution of enzymes and metabolic function does not exist initially. Towards the end of gestation, the adult pattern of heterogeneity for these processes begins to emerge, and after birth, the adult pattern is rapidly established (Ring <em>et al<\/em>. 1999)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is in vitro evidence for the activity of glutathione S-transferase and sulfotransferases in the human fetal liver. Returning to the asymmetry of fetal liver function (albeit in sheep..) it was found that levels of malondialdehyde, an index of lipid peroxidation, oxygen consumption, and CYP levels (a family of oxidative enzymes), are higher in the left lobe than the right lobe of the fetal liver which evens out after birth.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, looks like a variety of metabolic enzymes are present in the human fetal liver from very early on after the organ is formed. We know a varitey of metabolic enzymes are present and the drug/dye metabolism studies show there is some fetal liver activity, albeit reduced from that of an adult or child. The limitation with many of the studies that have been done is that they have to use in vitro data and extrapolate to the in vivo situation, so I guess we still don't really know for sure how metabolically active it is. It is clear though that it remains inefficient and unable to carry out all the functions required of it during childhood/adulthood until after further development after birth when it has stopped growing and adapted to ex utero conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Ring JA, Ghabrial H, Ching MS, Smallwood RA, Morgan DJ.

There have been several theories for how these groups of genes have arisen but the current feeling seems to be based around the regulation of the genes in question <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QisJq.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>. To facilitate co-ordinated gene regulation there may have been strong selection for physical clustering of genes involved in a particular process. By being physically clustered this also means that all the genes within a given operon are probably subject to the same chromatin remodelling and will then be more easily switched on and off under the appropriate conditions i.e. all turned on when they are needed and switched off when they are not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operons with similarly arranged genes have been found in different micro-organisms, leading to the thought that the operon was an ancient and evolutionarily conserved arrangement [2]. The figure below from Fani et al. 2005 presents two possible ways of generating the current state of genome organisation for present day proteobacteria. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QisJq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>If the operon is an ancient arrangement we would predict high gene conservation within operons; but genome analysis of different micro-organisms shows this not to be the case (i.e. gene conservation is low and operons are pretty unstable). Accordingly, another author suggests that due to the lack of conservation, operon structure is pretty plastic and can change readily during evolution [3]. Indeed, Fari et al conclude in their paper that the histidine biosynthesis operon has been a construction or re-construction event from scattered genes and not from the descent of an ancient arrangement:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our model suggests that the his gene organization in the extant proteobacteria arose from a gene scattering in the genome of the proteobacterial ancestor. The model also predicts that all or most of the his genes (except for hisD) were monofunctional and that they underwent a progressive clustering and compacting which occurred together with gene overlapping and fusion events<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They found, as you suggested, evidence for several gene modifications which included elongation, duplication and gene fusions.

The file you area asking about has been extended for FlyBase's purpose and I'm only dimly aware of its existence. It looks like Flybase has tried to rename the probe set to a minimal gene list and create less ambiguous mappings.  I'm not familiar with it.  If I have time Ill try to look at it and put something here, but I'm fairly slammed this week. <\/p>\n\n<p>In general you should know, there is a many to many relationship between probe sets from arrays and genes.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons for this.  The most common reasons: <\/p>\n\n<p><em>More than one probe set per gene<\/em>\n1) More than one start sequence per gene. The IVT arrays such as you are looking at read only the 3' end of the gene.  If there are  more than one such terminii, you will have more than one probe set. \n2) Duplicate genes.  If the 3' end of the gene has been duplicated recently, then a probe set may read more than one gene and not be able to distinguish them, so it will have both gene references in its annotation files. \n3) Duplicate probe sets. For older arrays, this did happen where the probes in two probe sets will be mostly or entirely the same. \n4) formerly separate genes are now joined into a single gene.  This is similar to (1) above, but with the added reason that two neighboring transcripts seen separately at the time of the array design are currently known to be part of the same transcript.  This is something we often don't think about, but the array may have been designed before your current gene of interest had a full length sequence.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In several cases the transcription behavior of the two probe sets will be quite different and you can decide which one to take based on how it behaves experimentally.  for example one of the probe sets may never respond while another one may register large changes with biological sample conditions.  Sorry I can't be of more help here. There are too many possible scenarios to consider to write about cogently.  <\/p>\n\n<p><em>More than one gene per probe set<\/em> \n1) a single stretch of DNA, even on the same strand, may simply be associated with more than one gene and the probe set will read both of them. \n2) Even if they are not exactly the same, some genes resemble each other in nucleotide sequence that is impossible to choose probes which do not read both of them.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Since they have similar read length to a probe set, all this is also true to some extent for short read NGS sequencers in RNASeq data. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can hopefully see, ambiguity is something you have to expect to some extent when deciding to work with a biological system.  In many cases (~ 80%) you will have a single gene read per probe set, but with those odds you'll be looking at the genome browser for a half dozen of your favorite experimental results.   <\/p>\n","answer_id":7650,"question_id":7646,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7646/one-flybase-gene-number-fbgn-many-affymetrix-ids","last_activity_date":1364230087,"creation_date":1364200231,"answer_count":1,"title":"One flybase gene number (FBgn), many Affymetrix Id's","body":"<p>I am trying to convert a set of Affymetrix ID's, like this one 143053_at_3745, to Flybase Gene Numbers (FBgn) like this one FBgn0000015.

For example height is affected by many genetic loci, not just 1 gene, and we can for the sake of the following illustration call them Locus A through Locus J - 10 Loci. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now this is purely illustrative and hypothetical - in actuality there are some differences between this example and the real world, but nevertheless I shall plough on. Imagine everyone carries a basic set of genes which makes them 150cm tall. Loci A-J each have two alleles, either <em>T<\/em> or <em>t<\/em>, with one inherited from each parent. Each <em>T<\/em> allele adds 2.5cm to the basic height per copy (each parent has two copies, one goes to the offspring) and <em>t<\/em> has no effect. The parents are both heterozygous at each loci, that is they have one <em>T<\/em> and one <em>t<\/em> at each pair of loci. Therefore both parents are 175cm tall.<\/p>\n\n<p>When these parents mate the offspring inherit one copy of each parent at random. As such the most likely single outcome is that the offspring will inherit 10 <em>T<\/em>'s and 10 <em>t<\/em>'s - roughly five of each from each parent. However, purely by chance they could receive 10 <em>T<\/em> alleles from each parent, giving them a height of 150+(20*2.5) = 200cm. Likewise, a sibling could also inherit only <em>t<\/em> alleles thus giving them a height of 150+(0*2.5)= 150cm. Thus variation can actually increase from one generation to the next.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are other reasons why we do not regress to the mean as well, but I am writing a quick answer over breakfast, but I will be in the office soon where I can get some more thorough explanations from text books.

Say, having version 1 (denoted T) gives you +1 to height, and having version 2 (denoted t) gives you -1. Suppose further that each version occurs in half the population.  Now every individual has 2 copies of each gene, so that 1/4 of people has TT for +2, 1/4 has tt for -2 and 1/2 has Tt or tT for 0 change in height.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now suppose two people with Tt or tT mate. If traits followed simple averaging pattern your friend suggested we would get the average of 0 and 0, that is 0 - all the time. But in genetic model (which is what really happens)  1/4 of the ofspring will get TT for +2, 1/4 will get tt for -2 and only 1/2 will actually get tT ot Tt for 0. Note that the variance - amount of variation - increases (everyone was 0 before mating, but some of the offspring has +2 or -2), whereas with the \"mixing\" model this does not happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>For another mating paring - TT with tT - 1/2 of offspring will have TT for +2 and 1/2 will have tT for 0, effectively replacing the parents, so that the amount of variation stays the same (since the mean of the population is 0 variance contribution of these two individuals is 2^2+0^2=4 in both parental and offspring populations). Note that the mixing model would have all offspring at +1, which decreases the amount of variation  (variance contribution going from 4 to 1^2+1^2=2).<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, the mixing model of mating always decreases variance - leading to the \"everyone looks average\" result in the long run, but the actual genetic mating keeps variance constant (unless another factor - like preferential mating, mutation, or environmental factors intervenes; this was pointed out in other answers). <\/p>\n\n<p>The same thing happens if the proportion of T and t are not 50-50. This is called the Hardy-Weinberg principle. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if there are many genes that contribute to height, the variance in a trait (like height) can be modeled as the sum of variances from each gene. Now if each one of the genes is inherited through the same genetic mechanism that preserves variance, the total variance will also be preserved.

This method assumes the knowledge of the sequence of (at least) the regions of DNA flanking what you wish to amplify. Using these flanking sequences, two short oligonucleotides (e.g., 18-24 nucleotides), called primers, are ordered such that one primer matches the 5' strand at the start of the sequence, while the other primer matches the 3' strand at the end of the sequence. When these primers are mixed together with the template DNA, and a DNA polymerase enzyme, and subjected to specific temperature cycles, amplification occurs.<\/p>\n\n<p>RACE PCR is a specific type of PCR. RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) PCR is used when the template strand to be amplified is a specific mRNA message. In other words, this form of PCR produces a DNA copy of cDNA from an mRNA starting product.
