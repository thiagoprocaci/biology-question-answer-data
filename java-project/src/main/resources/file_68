This offers a rough explanation of why thymine is more protected then uracil.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the real question is: Why does thymine replace uracil in DNA? The important thing to notice is that while uracil exists as both uridine (U) and deoxy-uridine (dU), thymine only exists as deoxy-thymidine (dT). So the question becomes: Why do cells go to the trouble of methylating uracil to thymine before it can be used in DNA? and the easy answer is: methylation protects the DNA. <\/p>\n\n<p>Besides using dT instead of dU, most organisms also use various enzymes to modify DNA after it has been synthesized. Two such enzymes, <code>dam<\/code> and <code>dcm<\/code> methylate adenines and cytosines, respectively, along the entire DNA strand. This methylation makes the DNA unrecognizable to many nucleases (enzymes which break down DNA and RNA), so that it cannot be easily attacked by invaders, like viruses or certain bacteria. Obviously, methylating the nucleotides before they are incorporated ensures that the entire strand of DNA is protected. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thymine also protects the DNA in another way. If you look at the components of nucleic acids, phosphates, sugars, and bases, you see that they are all very hydrophilic (water soluble). Obviously, adding a hydrophobic (water insoluble) methyl group to part of the DNA is going to change the characteristics of the molecule. The major effect is that the methyl group will be repelled by the rest of the DNA, moving it to a fixed position in the major groove of the helix. This solves an important problem with uracil - though it prefers adenine, uracil can base-pair with almost any other base, including itself, depending on how it situates itself in the helix. By tacking it down to a single conformation, the methyl group restricts uracil (thymine) to pairing only with adenine. This greatly improves the efficiency of DNA replication, by reducing the rate of mismatches, and thus mutations.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3589,"question_id":171,"up_vote_count":15,"last_edit_date":1348002238},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbc094f163713d6e098765a12994b246?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9033,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9033/ganesh-ujwal","reputation":365,"display_name":"Ganesh Ujwal"},"score":8,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1418270446,"creation_date":1418270446,"body":"<p>I opened <strong>Lehninger (Principles of biochemistry, 4th ed.) on page 293<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The slow Cytosine deamination reaction seems innocuous enough, but is\n  almost certainly the reason why DNA contains thymine rather uracil<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>C is deaminated to U in a rate of 10^-7 in 24 hours, which means 100 mutations a day for a mammalian cell which would have lead to a A-U genome in a short time.

These resonances largely determine the playing frequency and thus the pitch, and the player in effect chooses the desired set of resonances by choosing a suitable combination of keys.

Specifically, treatring cigarette consumption like a continuous variable, rather than a binary for \"smokers\" and \"nonsmokers\".

The latter reports odds ratios, which means that they did a logistic regression, which means that the raw logistic regression coefficient was 3.2.  If the average smoker smokes 20 cigarettes a day, and the dose-response relationship is linear, then the relative risk for someone who smokes one per day should be exp(0.32) = 1.37.  So someone who smokes one cigarette per day would be 1.37 times more likely to get lung cancer than someone who never smoked (on average).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this a reasonable estimate?

Certain types of lymphomas arise from these same B cells. When rituximab attaches to this protein on the B cells, it makes the cells more visible to the immune system, which can then attack.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(...)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cetuximab (Erbitux), a monoclonal antibody approved to treat colon cancer and head and neck cancers, attaches to receptors on cancer cells that accept a certain growth signal (epidermal growth factor). Blocking this signal from reaching its target on the cancer cells may slow or stop the cancer from growing.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(...)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) targets a growth signal called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that cancer cells send out to attract new blood vessels. Bevacizumab intercepts a tumor's VEGF signals and stops them from connecting with their targets.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(...)<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ibritumomab (Zevalin), approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, combines a monoclonal antibody with radioactive particles.

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine contains an antibody that attaches to the HER2 receptors on the breast cancer cells.

Most cells in the body do not divide rapidly, and this slowing down of proliferation is integrated into differentiation into whatever tissue the cells are in. The most obvious cells that divide rapidly are stem cells (themselves carcinogenic!). Furthermore, it seems to be a common theme in cancer that the less differentiated (or more de-differentiated) you are, the more easily you divide, and hence the nastier the cancer you generate.<\/p>\n\n<p>As such, the worst cancers out there are going to be very undifferentiated, and express few eligible surface markers. What's more, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_evolution_in_cancer#Natural_selection_in_cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumors evolve<\/a>. If you start selecting against cells which express your marker, you will encourage the tumor to simply evolve and stop expressing that marker. Back to the benchside to look for a new marker - meanwhile your patient gets worse and worse.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is why generalized chemotherapies (or radiotherapy) are so attractive. They attack the rapid division of cancer cells, and the cancer cells cannot evolve to lose this property, because if they did, they would not be cancer cells.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24752,"question_id":8539,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8539/are-there-any-examples-where-magic-bullet-drugs-have-worked-in-cancer-treatmen","last_activity_date":1418177665,"creation_date":1369609352,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any examples where 'magic bullet' drugs have worked in cancer treatment?","body":"<p><strong>Magic bullets<\/strong> are drugs that can be administered on a micro local scale.

This would make the co-factors we call vitamins, protein and sugars freely available to the digestive system and more easily absorbed.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think it is a marketing literature claim, though the blender may have some valid advantages... details below. <\/p>\n\n<p>Stainless steel waring blenders used to be typical pieces of lab equipment which could be used to homogenize tissue to extract proteins or DNA from tissue.  These blenders would <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_disruption#Rotor-stator_Processors_and_blenders\" rel=\"nofollow\">typically run from 10k-30k rpm<\/a>.  The web search for 'cell lysis blender' gives lots of examples of prepping DNA from plants at these speeds, but they don't complain for speeds towards the lower end of the range.  A reputable looking example in my short search: This paper for <a href=\"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/91/3/816.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tomato fruit cell wall preparations<\/a> doesn't even give a speed the blender might have run at.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Cell lysis in the literature is not precise - the cell toughness, the strength of the tissue around it and other such factors all come into play.  Putting woody stems into your blender and those cells won't really get opened up at all.  Also in the cell literature cell lysis buffers may have detergents or other chemicals (the reference above is done in 50% ethanol) to weaken the cell walls.  Not exactly what you'd want to use if you were making a health drink.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In experiments they have to contend with oxidation that happens when the cells are broken open with all the air whipping through the mixture.  This is one reason you don't see blenders in labs to much anymore - hydraulic presses, sonicators, and bead beaters have taken their place - they have less aeration in the mixture and also deliver more power so that they can break open yeast and bacteria, which blenders really can't.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So there will be some vegetables where the cell walls won't break open and all the nutrients won't be so easily accessible.  It must help to be running at the top end of the range, but there will always be some vegetables which won't be broken open.  For most things like bananas and apples it sounds like you'll get similar benefit with other blenders too.  Just have to think about how much more are you paying for that extra 10k of rpm I guess. <\/p>\n\n<p>Is there a benefit to breaking open the cells and letting all the nutrients (as well as cell waste) break out into solution?  It might give you a quick pulse of nutrition when you drink, but I'm pretty sure all the cells of a piece of fruit or vegetable will be pretty much broken down and extracted by the end.  On the other hand, it sounds like it will save the digestive system some work...

The reasons why certain plants are inedible seem to me also as rather diverse, like most plants\ndeveloped their own special molecule(s) to avoid being eaten by us. :)\nI would be interested in some more educated opinion on this thought than mine.

The first is the amount of protein loaded - more protein will give a stronger signal, less will give a weaker signal. However, too much protein can result in indistinct bands, increased background, lane distortion, and other issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next condition to change is the amount of primary antibody and the incubation buffer. More primary may lead to an increased signal, but too much can give higher background. Some antibodies give a better signal when diluted in BSA, others when diluted in nonfat dry milk. Generally, milk will give you a cleaner blot, but may reduce the signal. Incubation time can also affect specificity and signal intensity - some antibodies will fully bind with a 1-2 hour incubation at room temperature, others require an overnight incubation at 4°C.<\/p>\n\n<p>The third condition to alter is the amount and type of secondary antibody. Increasing the amount of secondary may increase signal, but again may result in increased background. There are also different types of secondaries, depending on your detection system - HRP for chemiluminescent detection, AP for colorimetric, fluorescent tags for imaging systems, etc. These have different sensitivities, but can also result in increased background, depending on the other conditions of the protocol.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the type of detection system can affect sensitivity. For example, when using standard HRP-conjugated secondaries, there are numerous different ECL substrates with widely varying sensitivities. <a href=\"http://www.piercenet.com/cat/western-blotting-substrates\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is a list of different systems available from Thermo/Pierce, ranging from standard ECL to Femto.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, while Western blotting seems like a fairly straightforward procedure, there are many places to optimize the conditions to get the results you're looking for.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24646,"question_id":24642,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyg92.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6061,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6061/rhill45","reputation":2493,"display_name":"rhill45","accept_rate":79},"score":0,"post_id":24652,"edited":false,"creation_date":1418346166,"comment_id":41014,"body":"Also a good answer @Fistula"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1418029960,"creation_date":1417990462,"body":"<p>Additionally to the points in the answer @mattdmo has given, it is possible to enrich the protein of choice before the gel run. This can either be done by using tagged proteins (possibly with the cleavage of the tag before loading) or by doing an immunoprecipitation of your protein. The later is interesting when you have only low concentrations of your protein present in the cell. What you basically do is to bind an antibody to the protein, the bind the protein-antibody-complex to a column or beads, wash away (in theory, practically you are not getting all the other proteins away) and then load the sample. Depending on the enrichment, you will be able to see a band, where this is not possible without immunoprecipitation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then washing and blocking of the blot plays an important role. Usually you use milk powder to prepare the blocking solution, as this is quite cheap and works pretty well. But it can give quite a high background and make problems with phosphoproteins (not necessarily though). Sometimes it's better to use more expensive solutions like BSA for blocking the membrane. The washing is also critical, depending on how stringent you wash, you will loose signal and influence the background. Here you can play with different concentrations of detergents as well as with different detergents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally you can get a lot of different signals in the detection. For chemolumincence based detection you can either use x-ray films (which are rather unsensitive) and have problems with strong bands outshining neighbouring weak ones. They are also harder to quantify, as the linear range in which more intensity corresponds with more signal is limited. With chemoluminescence you can also use special highly sensitive CCD-cameras (which are more sensitive and have a much higher linear detection range) or phospho-imager plates (special plates, which store the chemoluminecent signal on a light sensitive plate and which are read out with a special scanner).<\/p>\n\n<p>The latest development in the detection technology are infrared scanners for which you use secondary antibodies coupled to a dye which fluoresces at infrared wavelength. These scanner are extremely sensitive and also allow the usage of two differently labelled secondary antibodies at the same time, which can be very handy in analyzing protein interactions. You will need primary antibodies from different species, though. The modern detection techniques also have the advantage of delivering digital files, while films need to be scanned before further use in publications.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24652,"question_id":24642,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1418029960},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4bfcc8562711ef546e94eefe0f159d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9002,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9002/miwadora","reputation":55,"display_name":"miwadora"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1418012605,"creation_date":1418012605,"body":"<p>One thing that others have not mentioned yet is that the time of the wash can affect the signal.

Thus only peripheral nerves can regenerate and not nerves located in the central nervous system (ie. spinal cord or brain).<\/p>\n\n<p>surgical nerve regeneration after a nerve is severed is not the only possible form of nerve regeneration, another example would be when the <strong>facial nerve<\/strong> is damaged by <strong>bells palsy<\/strong> and then it regenerates itself. so a fun example of what can go wrong is when some of the nerves switch when they regenerate, so your brain thinks it's doing one thing, but since the nerves switched when they regenerated, it does the other. The example would be \"crocodile tears syndrome\", it has nothing to do with crocodiles (thats just the name) but rather this is where the facial nerves salivation fibers get switched with the crying fibers... so when they eat they cry...<\/p>\n\n<p>as for neuro-rehabilitation in people suffering paralysis, this is a broad question.

Here are some specific conditions:<\/p>\n\n<p>Also it could be a temporary thing like <strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome<\/strong> where the immune system (hyper sensitized by a previous campylobacter bacteria or CMV virus, or for some other reason) temporarily injures the peripheral nerves and then after about 2 weeks they recover)<\/p>\n\n<p>also there is there are <strong>drugs and toxins<\/strong> which are temporary, so one your body metabolizes/excretes (bile or urine) it is gone: <strong>botulinum toxin<\/strong> (from bacteria Clostridium botulinum), <strong>curare<\/strong> (south american plant poison), the many chemically modified versions of curare produced by pharmaceutical used in surgery to relax the muscles, and the list goes on for drugs/toxins.

Actually, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis\">neurogenesis<\/a> is pretty rare in the adult brain--most of the cortex is fixed, and new neurons do not grow. (The hippocampus is the best known counterexample, but it's important to note that contrary to lore, the hippocampus doesn't store memories <em>per sé<\/em>, though it is involved in the formation and retrieval of memories).<\/p>\n\n<p>Memories are represented in the brain as patterns of firing neurons. Let's say, for simplicity, that each neuron can either be on or off. Since there are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/28/how-many-neurons-human-brain\">86 billion neurons in the brain<\/a>, we can experience 2^86bn possible brain states. That's a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course there are a lot of simplifications here--most notably, there is a lot of structure to the brain, and so i'm not suggesting you can store 2^86bn memories--but the logic is the same. Even with only 1,000 neurons, we can store a ridiculous amount of information (2^1000).<\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to comment on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/5406/562\">MCM's answer<\/a> as well, because I don't think it's true that we \"remove\" old memories.

What you're describing, though, here is <em>brood parasitism<\/em>. This relieves the parasitic parent of the responsibility of rearing young, building nests, protecting the eggs, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Brood parasitism is seen in a number of duck species, with females laying their eggs in the nests of others. One example is the goldeneye, Bucephala <em>clangula<\/em>. Interspecific brood-parasites include the most cuckoos and cowbirds, black-headed ducks, and indigobirds, whydahs, and honeyguides. About 1% of all known bird species are obligate brood parasites (never make nests, need a host). <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture of a reed warbler feeding a cuckoo which was a parasite, its egg having been laid in the warbler's nest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Parasite nestlings suffer a relatively high mortality, either from rejection by the host (host bird will not feed the parasite) or rejection before fledgling (once nestling graduates to tree branch, the hosts stop feeding it).

Common sense will therefore need to come into play.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a cowbird thought it was an indigo bunting, it would not be able to reproduce, as it would try to attract a bunting mate and fail. Since the hosts continue to experience parasitism over many generations, and the population of parasites does not necessarily decline in a given area over several generations (in some areas, it is the host population that declines), I would have to say, <strong>yes, the bird 'knows' it's different (probably only on an instinctual - not cognitive - level); the parasite bird feels nothing about its bad behavior, and does not learn their own behavior from their host parents.<\/strong> Instinct takes over; they mate with their own kind, and continue to parasitize the host birds' nests.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brood parasite<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/05/24/rspb.2012.0612\" rel=\"nofollow\">Host\u2013parasite coevolution beyond the nestling stage?

This makes it hard to decide which steps are important and which are not. One prominent example would be the use of EDTA in DNA gel running buffers. This recipe originated from RNA research (where you need the EDTA) which where then simply used for DNA as well. Since it worked somehow, it was never really changed.I have seen enough people in the lab clinging to old photocopies of protocols without knowing why they do certain steps.<\/p>\n\n<p>And the other (connected) issue is that protocols are usually passed down through labs. Things are then done in a certain way because they have always done in this way (with some changes in the protocol probably not even documented) and are not changed. People are even told to use the exact routine, even if this makes absolutely no sense.<\/p>\n\n<p>In publications there may also be another thing which comes into play: The fear that someone uses the own methods and will then be faster than the own group. At least some groups only publish incomplete and vague methods because of this reason. Then it's a thing of space: There are character limitations in publications and when you need to save a few hundred characters when the article is too long, it's much easier to shave the methods than the discussion. <\/p>\n","answer_id":24656,"question_id":24653,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24653/whats-up-with-all-the-vague-protocols","last_activity_date":1417992320,"creation_date":1417990942,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's up with all the vague protocols?","body":"<p>I have lost count of how many protocols I've seen, including those supposed to be professionally written (such as manuals that come with kits from well known brands, or methods sections of papers in respected journals), that outright fail to give unambiguous instructions.

Determining the focus of a visual image is carried out in the <a href=\"http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter07.html\">visual association area<\/a> of the brain. Ultimately, this process results in focusing of the retinal image by adjustment of the shape of the lens in the eye. Lens shaping to focus the image is called <strong>accommodation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The neuronal circuitry involved in accommodation includes the following structures:<\/p>\n\n<p>The input to the accommodation response is provided by the retina, optic nerve, thalamus, and visual cortex. The visual cortex projects to the association cortex. <\/p>\n\n<p>The (simplified) output scheme is the following: The association cortex projects to the supraoculomotor nuclei, which in turn generates motor control signals that initiate the accommodation response. The signal is then sent bilaterally to the oculomotor complex, and hence input from one eye is enough to focus both eyes.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The motor output regulates the ciliary muscles that control the shape of the crystalline lens. Negative accommodation  adjusts the eye for long distances by relaxation of the ciliary muscles. Positive accommodation  adjustment of the eye for short distances by contraction of the ciliary muscles <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/accommodation\">Medical Dictionary<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to the second part of your question: how out-of-focus images are functionally recognized:<\/p>\n\n<p>There are at least three mechanisms responsible for accommodation:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Detection of <strong>image blur<\/strong>: if an image is blurred / out of focus the edges are not clearly defined. Retinal blur can be detected (edge detection) and assessed in the brain. Correction is then initiated as described above, and is basically done by trial and error. If adjustment results in a change of blur, the accommodation response (lens deformation) is detected as useful and accommodation is initiated. The accommodation itself is also based on trial-and-error: if blur increases the accommodation is reversed, if it decreases accommodation is increased in the same direction. (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01569293\">Philips &amp; Stark, 1977<\/a>). Image blur operates monocularly and is sufficient for accommodation to occur and is likely the most important mechanism for accommodation. It can occur without prior knowledge of distance, size etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two more specific cases also result in accommodation, with likely similar neural circuitry involved:<\/p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Vergence / retinal disparity<\/strong>. This stimulus is generated when the eyes move both in opposite directions, i.e. when focus shifts toward objects closer or farther away. The temporary displacement on binocular retinal images is detected and leads to initiation of accommodation <a href=\"http://jp.physoc.org/content/137/3/488.full.pdf\">Fincham &amp; Walton, 1977<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>3). The <strong>near response<\/strong>: While 1) and 2) are retinotopic responses, the near-response is initiated by spatiotopic stimuli, including perceived depth and distance of objects, which are derived from cues such as relative size, overlap, perspective, shading and texture gradients as well as small timevarying dynamic depth cues which include motion\nparallax, loom and motion in depth.

Differences will inevitably\n  exist between actively replicating viral DNA and that which is\n  integrated into the host genome. The type of viral persistence will\n  also be of importance. The integration of adeno- or polyomavirus DNA\n  into the host genome is usually a terminal process since the viruses\n  cannot liberate their genomes and are therefore no longer infectious.\n  The evolutionary roles of methylation in these cases will likely\n  differ from those seen in other viruses, such as Herpesviruses, which\n  can liberate their genome after periods of latency. But differences\n  may also exist between large and small viruses\u2014with many larger\n  viruses encoding their own replication machinery and additional\n  proteins which modify host cell processes and immune responses. The\n  susceptibility of the viral genome to methylation and immune\n  recognition will also be affected by other factors, such as the\n  location of replication within the cell and the specific intracellular\n  trafficking route.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Viral DNA methylation has mostly been studied in large DNA virii, and the extent of methylation may be related to repression of viral replication. Bonvicini et al. writes that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Epigenetic mechanisms, and in particular the impact of cytosine\n  methylation at CpG dinucleotides on the viral life cycle have been\n  mainly studied for viruses that can establish latency and undergo\n  reactivation, such as viruses in the Herpesviridae family, or for\n  viruses that can integrate their genome into the host genome such as\n  Retroviridae or Papillomaviridae. In general, a correlation has been\n  found between the extent of CpG dinucleotides methylation of viral\n  genomes and viral quiescence [24].

It has evolved into the current state and there is no reason to assume that this ended. When there are mutations which prove advantageous, they will evolve. This may also involve a faster response time for example, but we can of course make not definite claims about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are antigens which are not recognized by the immune system, the process is called molecular mimicry. In it, microorganisms mimic molecules or structures which are found inside the body of the infected person and which are therefore not recognized by the immune system (if the immune system recognized self-antigens, this leads to autoimmune diseases). Have a look at the references 1 and 2 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a rather theoretical question. Our immune system is really efficient in clearing potential threats before you get a real infection. You can see the difference when you compare healthy individuals with persons which are immuno suppressed because of a transplantation. These persons need to be very careful about their environment in avoiding the exposure to potential pathogens. And they easily get infections. Additionally microbes evolve to evade our immune system. So I think the answer here is no.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are viruses which co-evolved with the organism, an example would be the ebola virus in certain fruit bats. Here it does no harm, while it is a big problem for humans. As there is a really, really big number of viruses available in nature, it is quite unlikely that we learn to tolerate all of them.

We are immediately aware of the number of dots in the typical arrangement of one to six. We need expend no counting to do so.

While reading the text, one of the passages stood out to me:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When comparing the estimates of vortex ring height with those of ring width, mullet and mackerel shed approximately round vortex rings, whereas eel vortex ring are almost twice as wide as they are tall. Such distorted rings are less likely to form and once formed, they are more likely to break up, all of which results in a different vortex pattern in the wake. <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ynn5A.png\" alt=\"Differences in Vortex Patterns (credit Muller and van Leeuwen)\"><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The time-resolved flow fields of eels indeed support the notion that the vortices in its wake break up: two independent studies, visualizing horizontal cross-sections through the eel\u2019s wake, observed that individual vortex cores elongate and split into two (Muller et al. 2001; Tytell 2004a). We can therefore conclude that the shape of the propeller, and hence implicitly the propulsion mechanism, might affect wake shape. This observation also implies that a propeller shape that promotes the formation of a suboptimal wake is less efficient, and therefore the absence or presence of a wake that is predicted to maximize efficiency is a valuable indicator for the hydrodynamic efficiency of a fish\u2019s swimming design.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, essentially during carangiform locomotion the body of the fish moves 1/2 wavelength whereas anguiliform swimmers make 1 wavelength. My questions are how can they make such a statement when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry\" rel=\"nofollow\">particle image velocimetry<\/a> (PIV) does not adequately measure the movements of anguiliform swimmers, let alone their efficiency, when they are essentially swimming through their own vortexes?

Until relatively recently, color vision in the peripheral field has been thought to be substantially less developed than color vision in the central field. <\/p>\n\n<p>Most estimates of peripheral color perception place the limit of trichromatic (RBG) vision at no more than 30 degrees from fixation; the visual field was thought to be completely color blind at about 50 degrees of eccentricity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Within the last 30 years, an increased understanding of the changing spatial scale in the peripheral field has led researchers to reevaluate what is believed about peripheral function.

In one paper, detection thresholds for colored disks showed that color vision, in particular color vision mediated by the L \u2013 M cone-opponent channel (luminance or blue\u2013yellow colors), persists up to at least 50 deg. The larger the color disc, the better the peripheral color vision.<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The range of eccentricities over which red\u2013green color vision is still possible is larger than previously thought. Color stimuli can be reliably detected and identified by chromatically opponent mechanisms even at 50 deg eccentricity. Earlier studies most probably underestimated this range. Differences could be caused by technical limitations and <em>the use of stimuli of non-optimal size.<\/em> (Emphasis mine) In agreement with previous studies we found that the decline in reddish-greenish L − M color sensitivity was greater than for luminance and bluish-yellowish S − (L + M) signals. We interpret our findings as being consistent with a functional bias in the wiring of cone inputs to ganglion cells (Buzás et al., 2006) that predicts a decrease but not a lack of cone-opponent responses in the retinal periphery.  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jjsDG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3953765\" rel=\"nofollow\">Color vision in the peripheral retina<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/faOv5.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.sharp-sighted.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=120\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Retina: Rods and Cones<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.journalofvision.org/content/9/4/26.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">3 Color perception in the intermediate periphery of the visual field<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":24514,"question_id":24506,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24506/can-the-human-eye-distinguish-colors-in-the-periphery","last_activity_date":1417690581,"creation_date":1417621597,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can the human eye distinguish colors in the periphery?","body":"<p>In the back of my mind I have the idea that human eyes can't notice the color of objects in the far periphery, and that any subjective perception of colors is done by the brain that tries to fill in the color percept.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is that true? <\/p>\n","question_id":24506,"tags":["neuroscience","vision"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1774,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1417690581}]}
