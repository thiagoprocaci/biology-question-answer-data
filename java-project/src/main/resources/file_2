In an RNA's point of view the Oxygen is helpful, unlike DNA, RNA is a short-term tool used by the cell to send messages and manufacture proteins as a part of gene expression. Simply speaking mRNA (Messenger RNA) has the duties of turning genes ON and OFF, when a gene needed to be put ON mRNA is made and to keep it OFF the mRNA is removed.

Because it is more stable it is more suited to storing genetic sequences with less degradation than RNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>But because DNA is so stable it requires a substantial amount of machinery just to separate and keep separated the strands when they are needed. It is therefore unlikely DNA was the original genetic material that came about via much simpler prebiotic chemistry.<\/p>\n\n<p>RNA being more polar is easier to separate. It also unlike DNA can actually catalyse a wide variety of reactions requiring only the RNA and some prebiotic chemistry such as metallic ions or simple fatty acids.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance the group I intron can catalyse single electron transfer in the presence of Iron (II) ions.

So if an organism found a way to turn its RNA to DNA for storage and back again it would have a significant selective advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Such a mechanism might be as simple as protein or ribozyme that could preferentially hold DNA in contact with RNA. Then the normal mechanisms of strand ligation could work both to produce DNA from RNA templates and RNA from DNA templates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over time there would tend to arise specialised versions to do each task, but each building on the original holding mechanism, which itself could have built on the ligase mechanism.

For example, G.F.Joyce wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/pdf/418214a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2002 Nature review article<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The primary advantage of DNA over RNA as a genetic material is the greater chemical stability of DNA, allowing much larger genomes based on DNA.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To expand, RNA is unsuitable for large genomes because the 2'-OH of ribose (obviously absent from the 2'-dexoyribose of DNA) renders the phosphodiester bond susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis (see illustration adapted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_hydrolysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HAadJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HAadJ.png\" alt=\"Alkaline hydrolysis of RNA\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This will occur slowly at pH 7.6, but at a <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja990592p\" rel=\"nofollow\">rate<\/a> calculated to be sufficient to degrade a 1000 nucleotide RNA in about 70 days. This explains why all RNA viruses have small genomes (and why some, like flu virus, are segmented).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why RNA for other informational functions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a variety of <em>ad hoc<\/em> arguments here, but none as conclusive as the argument above for DNA. This is partly because there are a variety of functions RNA performs \u2014 one can make different arguments for each. Before making a point that I don\u2019t think has been made above, I would say that RNA most likely preceeded DNA (whether or not one believes it preceeded protein) and that there would have had to be a selective advantage for organisms to switch from RNA to DNA. One can see that for the genome, but not for the other functions.<\/p>\n\n<p>This argument also applies catalysis, but in a slightly different way. If RNA enzymes (ribozymes) preceeded protein enzymes, most ribozymes have been dumped because protein enzymes are more efficient and organisms which developed them were at an advantage. Those that are left are so intimately involved with RNA that replacement by proteins would have been difficult. So answers to this question about DNA not being able to replace catalytic RNA, though correct, seem to me peripheral the general question of RNA function.<\/p>\n\n<p>The central function of RNA is surely in protein synthesis \u2014 mRNA, rRNA, tRNA. One thing that these perhaps have in common is a three-dimensional structure that differs from an extended double helix. (Yes mRNA has tertiary structure too.) RNA lends itself more readily to such structures because the chemical difference between ribose and deoxyribose leads to a different helical structure (A-helix) from that of DNA (B-helix).

I appreciated it but if I were you I think I would rather try <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0981519423\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elements of population genetics (Charlesworth)<\/a> or <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1405132779\" rel=\"nofollow\">Population Genetics (Hamilton)<\/a>. There is also <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0763757373\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genetics of Populations (Hedrick)<\/a>. I would tend to think that this last book presents lots of empirical population genetics data and doesn't take as much focus as the others in theoretical concepts (but I might be wrong). <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0801880092\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gillespie's Population Genetics: A Concise Guide<\/a> is a classic.

It makes a good review about all subjects that are usually taught to first year students in Biology such as linear algebra for example. It is highly accessible and in the meantime it goes pretty far as it ends up talking about the application of diffusion equation in population genetics (Kimura's work among others). This book presents some important models in population genetics but as it aims to provide the tools for mathematical modelling in ecology and evolution it may under-considerate some fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. For example, the book does not talk about population structure nor about evolutionary game theory and there is little about Coalescent theory.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other books treating specific subjects within population genetics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0974707759\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coalescent Theory: an Introduction (John Wakeley)<\/a> is a good book. I haven't read it completely for both time issues and because the math are a bit complicated for me. Coalescent theory offers a very important set of mathematical tools in evolutionary biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's also <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387201912\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mathematical population genetics (Ewens)<\/a>. I am currently reading it. It is definitely not an introductory book and it really doesn't cover much of the most common fields in population genetics.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are particularly interested in age-structured population, <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521459672\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolution in age-structured populations (Charlesworth)<\/a> is a very good book.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005OKYTXU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modeling evolution (Roff)<\/a> offers some discussion on how to mathematically define fitness from phenotypic traits. While it is interesting I would not counsel you to buy it. Moreover, all the mathematics are quite basic and it aims to explain how to perform mathematical modelling with R which is to my opinion not essential to learn as other languages make a better job at dealing with math (Mathematica for example).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521116082\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolutionary Conservation Biology (Ferrière, Couvet and Dieckmann)<\/a> is a very good book of conservation and conservation genetics. It develop some mathematical models that are of special interest to conservation of populations and communities.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Ecology-Genetics-Evolution-Metapopulations-Hanski/dp/0123234484/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406725307&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=mutational%20meltdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecology, Genetics and Evolution in Metapopulations (Hanski and Gaggiotti)<\/a> is a book that may interest you as well.

However, your question is answerable if you are interested in a summary of the state of the debate.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>All living organisms are made up of one or more cells<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>An exception to this would be known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life\" rel=\"nofollow\">non-cellular life<\/a>. Whether anything could or does fill this category is a controversial subject. Considering the fact that the main points included in most definitions of life are based on observations of cellular life, this is not surprising.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, the strongest candidates for non-cellular live (in descending order) include: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">viruses<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viroid\" rel=\"nofollow\">viroids<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion\" rel=\"nofollow\">prions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viruses are the non-cellular entities most often considered potentially alive. Viruses are even classified in genera and species. They carry genetic material, they evolve, and they use various proteins as their machinery of action. However, they are unable to metabolize or produce their own proteins. They depend on infected cells doing all the work for them. Because they are incapable of acting on their own, they are not considered living by many. (The definition for life usually includes metabolism, the ability to process one's own food and energy.) The counter argument is that all life ultimately depends on external factors for survival, so viruses depending on cells for living may not be a disqualifier since they still control the processes resulting in their reproduction.<\/li>\n<li>Viroids, like viruses, depend on other cells to carry out metabolic and reproductive processes for them. Unlike viruses, viroids lack any protein whatsoever. As a result, even fewer people are willing to consider viroids alive. However, the same logic used to argue the biotic nature for viruses can be used for viroids. They copy themselves the same way many RNA viruses do, with the exception being they forgo directing the construction of any protein coat for themselves. Conversely, viroids can also be used as evidence against even viruses being considered life, precisely because of their similarity. If a viroid obviously is not life, viruses must be held suspect since they can be argued similar to viroids than cellular life.<\/li>\n<li>Prions are interesting. They do not reproduce like viruses or cell. That is to say they do not direct cellular machinery to construct copies of themselves. Instead, they modify existing proteins they come in contact with. From one angle, they are far less active in their flavor of reproduction than viruses. However, they are also more directly involved in their self-replication than viruses. Also, they can spread between organisms. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mad cow disease<\/a> is a well known example of this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Back and forth arguments aside, it has become fairly common to view viruses as a sort of middle ground between life and non-living processes, not one or the other.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Cells are the smallest units of life<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This one is not quite separate from numbers 1 and 3.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any non-cellular lifeform could be used to ague that the cell is not the most basic unit of life.<\/li>\n<li>Similarly, a cell not originating from a pre-existing cell could be used to make a similar argument, because it is highly unlikely that all the process found in even the most basic cell could start from scratch. They would have needed to exist before the cell in question, and then become incorporated into the cell. This rational is the basis for hypotheses like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world\" rel=\"nofollow\">RNA world<\/a>, which are used to explain how life's processes could have been started, in piecemeal fashion, before being locked in cells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Of course, we can also used the above points to argue that the cell is, indeed, the smallest unit of life.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viruses, viroids, and prions can be used to support the assertion that cells are the smallest unit of life. Even though they are not cells, their reproduction is only made possible by the activities carried out <em>within cells<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Things like the RNA world (if real) only would have required the processes for life gradually building up from less ordered, spontaneous reactions. An RNA world could be argued as a world devoid of true life, since life can be argued as <em>things<\/em> which carry out several key processes, and not as merely the individual processes themselves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>Cells arise from pre-existing cells<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This one is the only easy one. This had to be violated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">abiogenesis<\/a>. There had to be a first cell (or group of cells created under common conditions).<\/p>\n\n<p>The origins of the first cell(s) are variously explained by the RNA world, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADV-protein_world_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">GADV-protein world<\/a>, and other hypotheses. Whatever the case, however life started, it had to have a start. This means there must be one or more cells in the history of life that were spawned from some natural processes lacking a parent cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>While it may be safe to say that <em>all<\/em> cells in history are not <em>required<\/em> to have had parent cells, it is also safe to say that it is extremely uncommon for parentless cells to come into being. Firstly, it is not something we have ever observed. Secondly, all indications point to all species being part of the same \"tree of life.\" This would mean that whatever conditions spawned the first cells must not have persisted. Either all life descend from the same single cell, or life started with many independently spawned cells that blurred their independent origins due to heavy horizontal gene transfer.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can view the cells from cells rule a bit like Newtonian gravity. It is mostly right, with its faults only becoming ovbvious under conditions not readily present on Earth.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aseptate fungal hyphae, giant algae and skeletal muscle fibres are often used as examples of cells that do not conform to the cell theory<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I am aware that the listed cells are unlike the \"standard cell\" ...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I forgot to answer this part, and I think it is important to do so.

You say that they are full siblings, so they share both parents. Then you use the lmer function (which I am not familiar with) to give you the total variance, within-group variance and between-group variance, ($V_{T}, V_W, V_B$ respectively). What you call $V_L$ would be the $V_W$. <\/p>\n\n<p>We know that $V_P=V_A+V_D+V_E$ <\/p>\n\n<p>In full siblings we also know that $V(A,A')=\\frac{1}2V_A+\\frac{1}4V_D$ where $A$ is the additive value and $D$ is the dominance value because they share a quarter of their gene combinations.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are treating with full siblings the $V_W$ should be then the $V_E$ and the $V_B$ would be the $\\frac{1}2V_A+\\frac{1}4V_D$ as you are seeing the variance between siblings. <\/p>\n\n<p>So no, you are not calculating correctly the $V_A$ because you are missing your $V_D$ on your counting.

There is no perfect symmetry in the real world. Since you said your left hand seems bigger than your right hand. There are several reasons why that's the case on you.<\/p>\n\n<p>1) if you are not yet an adult, then the asymmetry may be caused by your body development. Another good example would be teenage girls' breasts. Teen girls may find one of their breasts is bigger than the other. That's normal, because you are under development. It would be more symmetric when you stop development and enter adulthood. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Long-term pressure, force may change the status of blood circulation in part of your body. For example, a right-handed tennis player may find his right arm bigger than his left arm (if without complement training of his left-hand).

This is a relatively small chromosome. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia claims we have identified around 200 genes on it to date<\/a>, compared to estimates of 20,000 - 25,000 genes overall in the human genome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Importantly for your question, only other males contain and make full copies of all the genes on the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome does not cross-over* with the X chromosome during meiosis when producing sperm cells, which keeps the Y genes isolated, except for rare exceptions (e.g. gene translocation). So those genes are passed down the male line only. The SRY gene is just one of the genes encoded uniquely on that chromosome, so <em>something else<\/em> is definitely missing - the question could be re-phrased \"how important to being a functional male are the unique genes other than SRY unique to the Y chromosome?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The linked question (an experiment on mice that produced XX \"males\" by finding an alternative trigger to the SRY gene to induce male development) demonstrates that in terms what we might consider a physical male specimen, the Y chromosome probably contains a minority of critical unique features. The mice developed into apparently complete physical males. That means genes outside of the Y chromosome cover most of the body development plan for both males and females. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, such XX males will in most mammal species not be fully functioning males - the missing genes do make a difference. One outcome is infertility - biologically speaking, XX males do not possess a key male function, the ability to mate with a female to produce offspring. There are missing genes related to sperm production. <\/p>\n\n<p>Human XX males - as in developmentally male - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">do occur naturally<\/a>. This can be caused by gene translocation - specifically the SRY gene moves to the X chromosome in a sperm from the father (potentially other Y genes will move in the same event). The symptoms that present with the syndrome vary, but give some indication of which critical components are missing.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Not all animals have the same mechanism. Birds have W and Z chromosomes (with males being ZZ and females ZW). Yet other animals do not use genetic switches, but environmental ones.

Frontiers In Microbiology, 5<\/p>\n\n<p>These processes occur co-translationally and are mediated by the SEC translocon and associated factors (especially GPI anchor transferases for tail-anchored proteins). However, my undergraduate research is focused on a viral protein which appears to be translated in association with SRP and co-translationally translocated to the ER by the translocon, but is not anchored to the membrane during translocation. This was shown (by others) by purification of the ER-associated fraction of the protein and centrifugation showing the majority pelleted with the dense, soluble fraction. A small fraction pelleted with the low density membrane-associated fraction, and my research further suggests that this membrane-associated fraction is important for its escape from the ER.<\/p>\n\n<p>The protein I am studying functions in the cytoplasm, not in the ER or in the secretory pathway, and therefore its escape from the ER is essential for its function. The typical ERAD pathway for soluble proteins involves retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon channel (the same channel involved in co-translational translocation, but with different associated factors during ERAD), but this would result in unfolding of the protein prior to its retrotranslocation to the cytosol. On the other hand, the ERAD pathway for membrane proteins (the \"dislocation pathway\") appears to dislocate folded membrane proteins while retaining most or all of their tertiary/quaternary structure (previous citation and below).<\/p>\n\n<p>Avci, D., &amp; Lemberg, M.

Another important question that this raises is <strong>whether retrotranslocation exclusively proceeds by feeding the N-terminus of a protein into the Sec61 channel, or if the C-terminus can be fed directly into the channel?<\/strong> If only the N-terminus could be fed into the channel, this would suggest most of the protein would have to be unfolded before the C-terminal domain became associated with the channel and was able to become membrane-associated, which voids the main benefit of the dislocation pathway; maintaining the folded state of the protein.<\/p>\n\n<p>If somebody can answer only this question regarding the translocon (and provide some relevant reading), I would be incredibly grateful because it would suggest further literature search to help support the mechanism I am proposing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","question_id":45666,"tags":["virus","virology","protein-folding","membrane-transport"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1461804817},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a57e9d301c04907195dd93a855b3bd37?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15199,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15199/medley56","reputation":45,"display_name":"medley56"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":31025,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428038741,"comment_id":51743,"body":"Hello.

However let's take a look at some of them:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>bacteria, most of the time we can see a bias towards some bases, this could be a GC bias, for example if the bacteria lives in extreme conditions, because GC can vorm three hydrogen bonds compared to AT which can only form two hydrogen bonds. So it's genome is more resistent to extreme temperature, less denaturation chance because the stronger bonds. In bacteria there are also some polymerases which have a bias towards bases, I won't discuss this in depth to keep it short, but from these two points we can already conclude the genome isn't random<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Homo Sapien, for example we need CpG Island near our promotor region, to regulate transcription. Further we have higher GC% in gene coding regions to reduce mutation chance, because we don't want to mutate genes wich are needed for survival. Their are also some sequence which are very specific for example TATA box and Poly-A signal, if our genome would be random, so all base would have a frequency of 0.25 these specific sequence could occur at place where we don't want them or they wouldn't occur at places where we want them. We need a promotor (with TATA box) for RNA polymerase binding, if our genome was random we have a big chance we would have genes wihtout a TATA box so no transcription of these genes will occur<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are a lot  more properties of the genome we could discuss but I think this will give you enough insight why the bases in the genome don't have a equally alike frequence of 0.25<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<\/p>\n\n<p>in addition to your second question: I think the chance of finding a genome which has an equally alike distribution is very small. because almost all organisms have undergo evelution, and when we have evolution there is natural selection and natural selection relies on mutations. So (almost) all genomes have udergo mutation, however this sometimes can favor an equally distibution for example if our genome is AGAA and one A mutates to an G we will have an equally alike proportion. So to summarize: maybe you can take a look at NCBI and look for a gc 50% wich means 50% AT so 25% of each base. If you find a genome wich has exact 50% gc, you have found your answer<\/p>\n","answer_id":45663,"question_id":45630,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1461822385},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7ced00ee0d98a2971462c140084e4b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23467,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23467/kelvin","reputation":148,"display_name":"Kelvin"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1461794836,"creation_date":1461794836,"body":"<p>There are two main driving factors to consider here:<\/p>\n\n<p>First, G/C and A/T represent complementary base pairs, as G is always paired with C (and vice versa), while A is always paired with T (and vice versa).

Therefore, G/C bas pairs are more thermodynamically stable than A/T base pairs, and require higher temperatures (more energy) to be pulled apart during replication and also transcription.  For that reason, organisms that have a higher body temperature tend to have a higher proportion of G/C base pairs than those which have a lower body temperature.  For example, the G/C content is higher in thermophilic bacteria than in mammals, and higher in mammals than in plants.  This fine-tuning of the G/C content enables the optimum balance between stability and the extra energy required to pull the strands apart when required for replication and transcription.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45668,"question_id":45630,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45630/what-is-the-frequency-distribution-of-each-base-in-a-dna-sequence","last_activity_date":1461822385,"creation_date":1461716415,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is the frequency distribution of each base in a DNA sequence?","body":"<p>Can we say that the frequency distribution of each base in a DNA sequence is equiprobable? <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After the negative answer; i rephrase: Is there a use case in which the frequency distribution of the bases is equiprobable?<\/p>\n","question_id":45630,"tags":["dna-sequencing","rna-sequencing"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"off-topic","is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1461805710},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc1aebd093464bb90150b34baf1aa77e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23540/berenice-kavanagh","reputation":1,"display_name":"berenice kavanagh"},"closed_date":1461830769,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45671/cellular-chemical-changes-during-mitosis","last_activity_date":1461813238,"creation_date":1461813238,"answer_count":0,"title":"cellular chemical changes during mitosis","body":"<p>How exactly, in terms of molecular behaviour/structure, do condensins, and cohesin s [in cell mitosis] achieve their functions within the cell?<\/p>\n","question_id":45671,"tags":["dna-replication"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"too broad","is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ec774be1cba4651da76170214e1d5d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":14538,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14538/user3082","reputation":87,"display_name":"user3082"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":29943,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424885966,"comment_id":48923,"body":"The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carbon Fixation<\/a> wiki page will interest you, especially the discussion about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation\" rel=\"nofollow\">C3<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation\" rel=\"nofollow\">C4<\/a> carbon fixation."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e2cd8503fa16262efed60c94d844f80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":22827,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22827/demonvalker","reputation":1,"display_name":"Demonvalker"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uS0Elf7lRBo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE8/R5J8cBgSOg8/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16299,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16299/vance-l-albaugh","reputation":1284,"display_name":"Vance L Albaugh"},"score":0,"post_id":44685,"edited":false,"creation_date":1459216613,"comment_id":77947,"body":"Welcome to BiologySE!

In a typical splicing event, the nucleotide that is 5' to the splice donor site (lets call it pre-donor) and the one that is 3' to the acceptor site (lets call it post acceptor) are joined together and the intronic sequence between them is removed. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you look carefully at the mechanism, you'll notice that the pre-donor (i.e. the 3' end of the first exon) renders a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous of the post acceptor (i.e. the 5' end of the second exon) which leads to the release of the intron.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2y4jc.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2y4jc.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a>\n  <sub> <em>Image courtesy<\/em>: <a href=\"http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/yeast/reviews/intron/spliceo_splicing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/yeast/reviews/intron/spliceo_splicing.html<\/a> <\/sub><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore there is always an exon preceding an intron, in the transcript.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, RNA processing can occur via a different mechanism in which the ends are just chopped off. This happens in tRNA processing, where RNAseP chops off a portion 5' to the mature tRNA region, called the leader sequence (see the figure below). I am not aware of such a mechanism happening in the case of mRNAs but a possibility certainly exists. One possible reason for mRNAs not having this kind of mechanism is because their 5' end is capped (co-transcriptionally) and cleavage of the 5' would lead to loss of cap and destabilization of the mRNA (all guesses, though). Similarly, the 3' of mRNAs is polyadenylated which also renders stability to them. Many lncRNAs are also capped and polyadenylated but there are exceptions (mRNAs too). <\/p>\n\n<p>Since this mechanism is not very common, there is no systematic name for the excised ends.

However, in practice chemical bonds are always broken as others are formed, and the net number of bonds is generally constant.  Otherwise you would end up with free radicals, which are highly reactive and looking to form a chemical bond with the next thing it touches.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the burning of glucose in respiration involves the breaking of C-C, C-H, C-O and O-H bonds in glucose and O=O bonds in oxygen, with the simultaneous formation of C=O bonds in CO2 and O-H bonds in water.  But the C=O bonds in CO2 and O-H bonds in water contain much less energy than the bonds we break within in glucose.  So the key is that the bonds formed contain less energy than the bonds broken, and energy is released overall.<\/p>\n\n<p>And actually it's a bit more complicated than that, because you also have to consider entropy, which is how disordered the system is.  Generally the more molecules in a system, the more entropy, so breaking a few big molecules down into lots of small molecules tends to release energy by increasing entropy.<\/p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, \"food\" is what we can draw useful energy from in the process of turning it into something else as we make and break chemical bonds.  We can't do this with water, or indeed with rocks, because their chemical bonds would require more energy to break than the energy we'd get back out by forming alternative bonds with anything else.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45601,"question_id":45589,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1461625571},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBnjL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22415,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22415/graham-chiu","reputation":254,"display_name":"Graham Chiu"},"score":-2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7ced00ee0d98a2971462c140084e4b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23467,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23467/kelvin","reputation":148,"display_name":"Kelvin"},"score":0,"post_id":45638,"edited":false,"creation_date":1461746430,"comment_id":79988,"body":"&quot;Plants use both water and air as food using photosynthesis ... to make glucose.&quot; - No, glucose itself is the &quot;food&quot; that is burned with oxygen in respiration, while CO2 and water are used by plants to make the glucose food by photosynthesis with the sun&#39;s energy.

To perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on large genomes (e.x. mammalian genomes) is very expensive if you are trying to achieve the 10x coverage requirement.<\/p>\n\n<p>The principle behind RRBS is to improve the sequencing depth of cytosine-rich areas by enriching your sequencing library with CpG-dense regions of the genome. This is accomplished through the use of CpG-specific restriction enzymes like <a href=\"https://www.neb.com/products/r0106-mspi\" rel=\"nofollow\">MspI, which recognizes 5'-CCGG-3'<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In RRBS, the entire genome is cleaved using MspI, leaving at least two cytosines per cleaved DNA fragment (one cytosine at either end of the MspI-MspI fragment). Sequencing libraries are constructed from size-selected MspI DNA fragments, bisulfite conversion is performed, and the converted library is sequenced. Specialized software is needed for alignment and analysis of the converted genome (e.x. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3102221/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bismark<\/a>, <a href=\"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-10-r87\" rel=\"nofollow\">methylKit<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the major limitations of RRBS is that you will sequence only CpG-rich regions of the genome. Also, since the library is size-selected after MspI digest but before adapter ligation, you will never sequence any MspI fragments outside of your size-selection range (~40-250 bp).<\/p>\n\n<p>I have analyzed both types of data and found that the RRBS data was very unsatisfying and didn't answer our research question. WGBS, though extremely costly, is a better option for a comprehensive cytosine modification profiling. There are publicly available RRBS and WGBS datasets at <a href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.encodeproject.org/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I must mention a critical limitation of both techniques in that neither RRBS nor WGBS can distinguish between the type of modification (methylation, hydroxymethylation, carboxylation, etc) present at a particular cytosine residue. RRBS and WGBS, which rely upon the ability of certain modifications to protect cytosines from deamination, can only be used to determine whether cytosine residues are modified or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Further reading:<\/p>\n\n<p>I would suggest following this link for an exceptional technical and practical article in which the authors compared RRBS to WGBS: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026711/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026711/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>A more technical guide to RRBS: <a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/RRBS_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/RRBS_Guide.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":45621,"question_id":45608,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1461715165}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45608/why-use-rrbs-reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing-instead-of-general-bi","last_activity_date":1461715165,"creation_date":1461635063,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why use RRBS (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) instead of general BiSeq?","body":"<p>My understanding is that RRBS is used for certain cases.

Many people have researched this topic, and many still are. But regardless, I had never heard of Alan Turing's contributions, so thank you!<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, I cannot actually find who first coined the term morphogen. Though people had hypothesized that chemicals could play a critical role in development through much of the 20th century, I cannot actually find the first person to use <em>morphogen<\/em>. But the most important paper really came from a guy named Lewis Wolpert, who came up with the model of a gradient of morphogens leading to differential cell fates. The idea being that if some area of an embryo produces a morphogen at a very high concentration, then as you move away from that area, the concentration goes down. So if this morphogen is required at or above a certain threshold for activity, then only those cells with that concentration will have a certain cell fate, while at lower concentrations, the cells can become something different.<\/p>\n\n<p>But this does not really answer your question. You are asking how a single cell, which is spherically symmetrical, can determine a particular axis. Though most organisms do this is in slightly different ways, the most common feature is that sperm entry point breaks the symmetry. The best way to explain this is to show you a diagram of Xenopus (frog) eggs.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h0qJw.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Image from: <a href=\"http://studentreader.com/nieuwkoop-center/\">http://studentreader.com/nieuwkoop-center/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The Xenopus egg, first of all, is inherently not spherically symmetrical. There is a black animal pole, and a white vegetal pole. The sperm can only enter a marrow region of the egg about 30˚ north of the animal/vegetal line. Upon fertilization, an event occurs where the pigmented areas turn toward the sperm entry point, leaving a gray crescent. Nearby the gray crescent, in the vegetal pole, a structure called the organiser develops. This organiser creates many of the morphogens that then pattern the rest of the embryo. <\/p>\n\n<p>Researchers have studied this a lot in many different organisms, but a few things really remain constant: eggs are not exactly spherically symmetrical, and the sperm entry point provides asymmetry.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3352,"question_id":2739,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4b4324aa7f181c635d35e9720cf71bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1332,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1332/jmerkin","reputation":21,"display_name":"jmerkin"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":3371,"edited":false,"creation_date":1346164252,"comment_id":5052,"body":"Welcome to Bio.SE!

Here is the just of what you are interested in:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because most point mutations are deleterious or neutral7, the random point mutation rate must be low8 and the accumulation of beneficial mutations and the evolution of a desired function is relatively slow in such experiments. For example, the evolution of a fucosidase from a galactosidase required five rounds of shuffling and screening before a >10-fold improvement in activity was detected4. Naturally occurring homologous sequences are pre-enriched for 'functional diversity' because deleterious variants have been selected against over billions of years of evolution...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Although shuffling of a single gene creates a library of genes that differ by only a few point mutations1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the block-exchange nature of family shuffling creates chimaeras that differ in many positions. For example, in previous work a single beta-lactamase gene was shuffled for three cycles, yielding only four amino-acid mutations3, whereas a single cycle of family shuffling of the four cephalosporinases resulted in a mutant enzyme which differs by 102 amino acids from the Citrobacter enzyme, by 142 amino acids from the Enterobacter enzyme, by 181 amino acid from the Klebsiella enzyme and by 196 amino acids from the Yersinia enzyme. The increased sequence diversity of the library members obtained by family shuffling results in a 'sparse sampling' of a much greater portion of sequence space15, the theoretical collection of all possible sequences of equal length, ordered by similarity (Fig. 4). Selection from 'sparse libraries' allows rapid identification of the most promising areas within an extended sequence landscape (a multidimensional graph of sequence space versus function)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Yte1.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Yte1.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":45606,"question_id":45572,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45572/why-is-dna-shuffling-more-efficient-than-point-mutation","last_activity_date":1461628795,"creation_date":1461559756,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why is DNA Shuffling more efficient than Point Mutation?","body":"<p>In a related post on Biology-SE the following insightful comment was made:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The advantage of DNA shuffling over introducing single mutations is\n  that you have to screen fewer mutants and the activity/stability of\n  the protein could be improved several hundred fold more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a mathematical argument as to why DNA Shuffling should be more efficient than introducing point mutations?<\/p>\n\n<p>Even supposing each DNA Shuffling / Point Mutation step is equally \"expensive\"  (and in reality DNA shuffling seems much more work) they are both generating one variant per-step, right?

A lot of times mutation is a random process, but here are three cases I can think of off of the top of my head where I would say the organism is 'trying' to do it:<\/p>\n\n<p>HIV is a retrovirus, which means in its viral form its genome is single stranded RNA, which is then converted into double stranded DNA within the host.  That conversion is carried out by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase.  This enzyme has a much higher error rate when making the RNA into DNA because it cannot proofread like our DNA polymerases.  This means that HIV mutates incredibly fast.  Many of these mutants are not very fit, but since there is so much selective pressure against staying the same due to attack from the immune system, some mutants will be much more fit if they can avoid that attack.  Its a numbers game, and by making lots of random mutants HIV is very good at it.<\/p>\n\n<p>A related, but different case is found in the diversity generating retroelements of certain bacteriophages.  These are double stranded DNA viruses that infect bacteria.  The bacteria these viruses infect could mutate to escape the viruses by losing a certain receptor that the virus binds to.  It was observed however that the the virus would mutate incredibly quickly to bind to a different receptor, a lot faster than would be expected for a DNA virus.  Also, it was found that these viruses contained reverse transcriptases, which is bizarre, since there is no reverse transcription step in a dsDNA viral life-cycle (so we thought).  To make a long story short, this virus will transcribe the DNA that codes for its binding proteins into RNA, then use its reverse transcriptase to turn that RNA BACK into DNA, but uses a sophisticated targeting strategy so that it only mutates the region that is used for binding to the bacteria.  It will only mutate adenine residues, leaving the C's, T's and G's alone.  This is a much more clever system than HIV, because this virus uses site-specific mutations on its binding feet, and doesn't mutate its core proteins, the mutation of which would probably just lead to viruses that couldnt replicate.  Here a reference for the interested: <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7007/abs/nature02833.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7007/abs/nature02833.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Just so you dont think this is reserved to viruses, we do this as well with our immune system.  In order to recognize antigens in attacking pathogens, our immune cells have two methods for making diverse, random, receptors.  First is V(D)J recombination, where the multiple diverse copies of the V, D and J regions of antibodies and receptors are combined at random to make one set.  Wiki says theres 3x10^11 possible combinations <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%28D%29J_recombination\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.  After that, theres also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation\" rel=\"nofollow\">somatic hypermutation<\/a> during the proliferation of B cells.  In this process, the random mutation rate is hugely increased in the region of the B cell receptor gene, specifically for making slightly different versions of the already 'OK' receptor to make it a great receptor.<\/p>\n\n<p>General theme: raising your mutation rate, either across the board(HIV) or specifically (DGRE and SHM) is a good way to intentionally add randomness for a beneficial purpose (to the extent that you can attribute 'intent' to a viral particle).<\/p>\n","answer_id":9672,"question_id":9669,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e1ab1d49d117486f24468608dcb028e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":22944,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22944/chris-rackauckas","reputation":121,"display_name":"Chris Rackauckas"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1461607710,"creation_date":1461607710,"body":"<p>I know of an example in development biology. <a href=\"http://www.math.uci.edu/~qnie/Publications/ja67.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is an example where noise in retinoic acid gradients is required for the boundaries in the developing hindbrain to sharpen<\/a>.

I can't seem to find any animal that has <em>exceptional<\/em> eyesight <strong><em>and<\/em><\/strong> sees in monochrome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Baring in mind the context of humans vs machines; machines cope better with shapes rather than colours however it generally appears that those animals which rely on exceptional eyesight to survive tend to see in colour and have other neurological systems to ease \"data overload\".<\/p>\n\n<h1>Animals that see in greyscale.<\/h1>\n\n<p>Some pinnipeds (seals) see in grayscale, but note that their survival doesn't seem to depend on visibility, and it is generally regarded as poor even in a typically healthy animal. <a href=\"http://goo.gl/84LoJL\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to sea world<\/a>, researchers have found blind seal mothers and pups have been found at that are otherwise perfectly healthy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Dolphins are a similar story. Its so murky that they rely on bio-sonar. Fresh water dolphins are almost completely blind. <\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, the more species that I have read that are monochromats, the more I see that these animals rely heavily on other senses. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some land animals with \"decent\" monochromatic vision:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lorisiformes<\/li>\n<li>Bats<\/li>\n<li>Raccoons<\/li>\n<li>Nocturnal kinkajous <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note that these often have another much more acute sense like smell or hearing. <\/p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, there is also not necessarily a link between monochromatic vision and nocturnal state (there are dichromats that are nocturnal, and some monochromats are crepuscular, or diurnal and <em>visa versa<\/em>). <\/p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many species, such as all marine mammals, the owl monkey, and the Australian sea lion are monochromats under normal conditions...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It looks like animals that have exceptional eyesight tend to have also evolved some sort of colour differentiation.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Why not ditch the colour info to make it easier on the brain?<\/h1>\n\n<p>To bring this back to your context of machines I would say that identifying the difference between a ball, a chair, a human, and a car (the sort of things machines need to know about!) is much more dependent on shape than colour. A monochromatic person wouldn't struggle with that at all. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>However<\/em> in nature telling the difference between grass and tiger stripes means that a trichromat may get to live another day whereas the monochromat might not see the tiger in time. Or spotting berries and fruit in some distant trees might mean food that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those are obviously very narrow examples, but generally it seems animals always have one or more exceptional senses limited to smell, hearing, or colour vision (it would be great if someone could point out an exception to this in the comments, like touch or taste!). <\/p>\n\n<p>You are right to hint that there is a lot of information in colour vision. Like your example with loss of colour in machines, data needs to be dumped very quickly in the human brain. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not a neuroscientist, but I have read pop articles about how little we can remember with photo detail. Within seconds of looking at a scene all texture details are lost, most objects are forgotten about and all we can really recall are big shapes. But importantly, we would notice the tiger in the woods before forgetting and run for it! If we had no colour input, that wouldn't be the case.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Examples of <em>more<\/em> colour being used.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Hopefully the above demonstrates that colours are important to many animals. If anything it seems that more colours even than our perception of the EM spectrum are preferable, particularly into the uv range.<\/p>\n\n<p>For prey identification reindeer rely on ultraviolet light to spot lichens that they eat.

In prehistoric times (before agriculture, when the primary source of food was hunting and gathering), when food was scarce, fatty and sugary foods would be of great importance. They would supply the body with large quantities of energy (a gramme of fat gives about 9 calories, a gramme of carbs gives around 4 calories). Since we survived mostly on fruits, vegetables, meat, and whatever roots we could find, something as energy rich as, say, a serving of deep fried cheese covered bacon would have sustained us for days. So eating anything with high calorific value, like a fat rich tuber would release 'feel-good' chemicals, like dopamine and serotonin, among others, which make us feel happy (dopamine is also released in response to hugs and accomplishing goals, serotonin is released, in very large quantities, during nicotine consumption). <\/p>\n\n<p>Our body these days just isn't used to our relatively sedentary lifestyle with  guaranteed food. Our body still hoards fat like it did during our time as hunter-gatherers, and our body still secretes dopamine everytime we dig into a sumptuous serving of cake.<\/p>\n\n<p>A couple of good sources:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697046\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697046<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Serotonin-releasing brain neurons are unique in that the amount of neurotransmitter they release is normally controlled by food intake: Carbohydrate consumption--acting via insulin secretion and the \"plasma tryptophan ratio\"--increases serotonin release; protein intake lacks this effect. This ability of neurons to couple neuronal signaling properties to food consumption is a link in the feedback mechanism that normally keeps carbohydrate and protein intakes more or less constant. However, serotonin release is also involved in such functions as sleep onset, pain sensitivity, blood pressure regulation, and control of the mood. Hence many patients learn to overeat carbohydrates (particularly snack foods, like potato chips or pastries, which are rich in carbohydrates and fats) to make themselves feel better. This tendency to use certain foods as though they were drugs is a frequent cause of weight gain, and can also be seen in patients who become fat when exposed to stress, or in women with premenstrual syndrome, or in patients with \"winter depression,\" or in people who are attempting to give up smoking. (Nicotine, like dietary carbohydrates, increases brain serotonin secretion; nicotine withdrawal has the opposite effect.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/addicted-to-fat-eating/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/addicted-to-fat-eating/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like many pleasurable behaviors\u2014including sex and drug use\u2014eating can trigger the release of dopamine, a feel-good neurotransmitter in the brain.
