This last point might have been very important at an earlier time when men were hunting outside while the females would work inside the cave.

(2012) Life History Evolution. Nature Education Knowledge 3(10):24\">Fabian &amp; Flatt, 2012<\/a> for background), and at its core this question is dealing with tradeoffs between e.g. fecundity and mortality.<\/p>\n\n<p>All organisms act under a limited energy budget, and when they spend energy on some activities that will limit what they can spend on other activities. \nThis lies at the core of life history tradeoffs.\nIf organisms use resources to produce or raise offspring, this can therefore have consequences on growth, maintenance (e.g. disease resistance), predator avoidance and many other traits and behaviours, which all affect fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to your question, there is a well-known tradeoff between survival and fecundity (an <em>intraindividual effect<\/em>), which has been shown both between individuals within species and across species.\nAs with almost all species traits, there is also variability between individuals within populations, so that some have higher fecundity than others, but may then also suffer lower adult survival rates (maybe under certain environmental conditions). \nTherefore, there are certainly already \"<em>mutation(s) that increases fertility among the predators<\/em>\" within populations.\nThe reason that fertility is not continuously increasing over time, is that this would have negative fitness consequences overall.\nSo the reason that the (average) life history traits within a particular species are what they are, is that they are the result of the evolutionary pressures that the species have been experiencing over evolutionary timeframes, acting on the entire life history. <\/p>\n\n<p>To be sure, hypothetical mutations/changes in life history traits that would increase fecundity with no negative tradeoffs whatsoever for either parents or offspring (i.e. no negative fitness consequences) would definitely increase in frequency. \nFrom the perspective of life history theory, everything else equal, selection will maximize the survival function, $l(x)$ (survival to age x) and the reproductive function, $m(x)$ (number of offspring at age x), while minimizing maturation age. \nHowever, tradeoffs between these functions (directly or indirectly) and between generations will prevent these from being optimized one by one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Population growth in long-lived predator species is usually also very sensitive to changes in adult survival rate <a href=\"http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Matrix_Population_Models.html?id=CPsTAQAAIAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Caswell. 2001. Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation. Sinauer\">(Caswell, 2001<\/a>).\nThis result comes from analysing stage or age structured population models, and is the result of a life history strategy with high adult survival rates, fairly high age of maturation and relatively low fecundity. \nTo increase fecundity in this situation with negative effects on adult survival will risk adult death and therefore loss of many future years of reproduction.\nThese kinds of results and models are often used to identify which life history traits and stages to target in conservation actions, but can also be used to understand evolutionary processes, since population growth rate can be used as an overall measure of fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>It should also be added that many other ecological processes must be considered.\nFor instance, large predators often care for their young for quite a long time, since their hunting/foraging behaviours are complex, and it takes a long time for young to learn how to hunt successfully by themselves. \nThis means that adults need to bear not only the direct cost of producing offspring, but also to support them until they are self-sufficient.\nFor an extreme case, look at the Orangutan (not a predator, but still) where the young stay with their mother and nurse for up to 5-6 years (sometimes more). \nTo increase fecundity in such a situation will put a large strain on adult mothers.\nYou also need to consider trade-offs between offspring number and offspring \"quality\", which have been demonstrated in many species (an <em>intergenerational effect<\/em>).\nThis means that an increase in fertility can result in lower offspring survival over longer timeframes, with overall negative effects on fitness. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, life history evolution is a large and complex field, and these are just a couple of examples and suggestions for why the situation isn't as simple as your question makes it out to be.\nEnvironmental variability and the predictability of the environment are other factors that I haven't considered at all, but are both important processes when you try to understand life history evolution.\nThis question can also be approached from a more theoretical perspective, but without a background in life-history evolution I think it is more useful to start reading about different processes and tradeoffs, and then later if you are interested to go into the theory for a deeper understanding. <\/p>\n","answer_id":28333,"question_id":28300,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1456482332}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28300/why-are-the-fertility-rates-of-large-predators-kept-low","last_activity_date":1456482332,"creation_date":1422999594,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why are the fertility rates of large predators kept low?","body":"<p>Predators at the top of a food chain, like lions, seem to have a relatively low fertility rate, which fits well to the ecosystem and avoids overpredation.

DMT is capable of building this alternate reality with which in normal circumstances we don't feel or perceive it. DMT can cause such dramatic shifts in consciousness, such that completely novel worlds appear.Our brain use various approaches,to create a mental field which gives a unified world and these two can be classified as functional segregation and integration. As humans we are very much visual creatures and the cortex region of our brain helps us in doing that. Our brain continues to develop, changes throughout life and across the span of evolutionary time. It becomes absolutely critical in determining how the brain interprets and categorizes sensory information and thus builds the consensus world and we reach a point where our brain can create or is capable of building worlds without extrinsic influence or data.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are the findings that were reported from the DMT studies<\/p>\n\n<p>1.Hallucination\u2014visual, physical, auditory;\n2.Entering other realities, sometimes including having contact with other sentient beings, which were described as true or real experiences rather than hallucinations;\n3.

Evolution is an optimization process driven by random mechanisms...i.e. there is often not a \"reason\" for why certain things are the way they are.  Evolution is not a conscious \"designer\" that produces things with a specific goal in mind...it simply \"picks\" the best random alteration and enhances it.  If there is no \"best mutation\", then there is no selection pressure to drive change overtime.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, one can ask, \"Why do humans have 5 fingers on each hand, instead of 6 or 4?\"  There is no answer, because the question itself is nonsensical.  Humans have 5 fingers simply because there is no pressure to drive a change to 6 or fingers, and so it boils down to randomness.  There is no \"reason\" humans have 2 arms, as opposed to 4.  That particular trait just randomly happened to be the one which became dominant.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to return to your question of \"Why does the brain release DMT when dying?\", the answer is that there IS no answer.  There is no selection pressure for or against that trait, it just happens.  As to the mechanism itself, I suspect that there is just a global breakdown of function in the brain, leading to a dump of ALL neurotransmitters.  When the reuptake pumps fail, the neurons just dump their contents into the extracellular space.  The result is pleasant hallucinations, giving the impression that humans are not \"meant\" to feel pain when dying.  Imposing that kind of rationale, however, is simply creating meaning out of chaos.  If you watch TV static long enough, your mind will start to see patterns which aren't there, simply because the human mind is \"wired\" to find patterns in chaos in order to better understand the environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>To wrap this up, I suppose the answer to your question is that the brain is finding meaning in meaninglessness, simply because that is what the brain does.  We look for patterns to make sense out of our environment, which sometimes leads to spurious conclusions.  There is no reason that the brain hallucinates when dying, but there IS a reason that this trait appears to be a built-in mechanism.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope I was able to shed some light on the issue.

It looks like we're not meant to feel 'bad' while dying, which is nice, but my question is - is it known why? What could be the evolutionary reason to create this mechanism?

Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises\n  during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations\n  of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response. In the\n  brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes\n  vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses\n  attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety.\"<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The shaking occurs <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC289510/?page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">because the body is increasing burning of energy<\/a>.  There's not many good links online for this (unsurprisingly google searches of \"noradrenalin shaking hands\" pretty much only returns 'medical' websites trying to tell people they have a brain tumor), but I think what happens is the muscles twitch as a result of the excess energy release.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/signs/affected-hands\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"When you suffer from anxiety, your body rushes with adrenaline - a hormone that gives your body a tremendous amount of energy, which - when unused - leads to physical agitation. That causes your hands and legs to shake, often visibly.\"<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Beta-blockers are known to reduce symptoms of noradrenalin and are frequently (if questionably and irresponsibly) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine#Beta_blockers\" rel=\"nofollow\">used to treat anxiety<\/a>. We may shake less when we practice a process multiple times possibly because with practice anxiety associated with such tasks (I imagine a surgeon is quite nervous the first time they open up a patient) and the level of focus required (intricate tasks become easier with practice thus requiring less focus) both reduce, therefore reducing the amount of focus-related and anxiety-related physiological changes.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43644,"question_id":43628,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1456425864}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43628/why-we-shiver-tremble-shake-while-performing-some-work-which-requires-high-accur","last_activity_date":1456425864,"creation_date":1456325369,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why we shiver/tremble/shake while performing some work which requires high accuracy?","body":"<p>Shivering when nervous or anxious is a common thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, shivering or trembling sometimes also occurs when we are performing a work which requires high accuracy.

A single movement typically doesn't evoke measurable activity, because its amplitude is so small with respect to background noise. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think the potentials you are looking for are <strong><a href=\"http://brainlang.georgetown.edu/research/erplab\" rel=\"nofollow\">event-related potentials<\/a><\/strong> or ERPs (Fig. 1). During ERP recording, basically a regular EEG is registered, but certain events (presentation of stimuli or actions by the subject) are time locked with the EEG recordings. By repeatedly measuring (e.g., 25 times) the time-locked response to the event, an average EEG can be obtained. Assuming remaining EEG activity, noise and artifacts are random, the averaging process will decrease noise, but will not affect the ERP.

There are different conformations to expose different sequences to the outside of the protein to react/catalyze. So there is no one perfect conformation for a protein in a biological system. <\/p>\n\n<p>The best models we have are taken through x-ray crystallography of the crystalized protein structure. This static portrayal of the protein may be inaccurate, because the biological system will expose the protein to different hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions than the affect of the protein to itself. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anfinsen's experiments were able to definitively prove the a proteins structure is coded by its amino acid sequence. To answer your question, this sequence is primarily responsible for a protein's core structure formation. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is still incredibly difficult to predict the structure of a protein using its amino acid sequence. The tertiary structure is a product of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic forces  and polar attractive forces within the molecule  (disregarding a proteins possible quaternary structure ). Scientists  (from what I believe is Yale, but I may be incorrect), have been trying to find a pattern using computing software for years. As of right now, we cannot purely use amino acid sequence to determine a protein's dynamic structure. <\/p>\n\n<p>Loops and coils on the outside of proteins because they tend to compose of polar or charged amino acids.

During hydrolysis by water, ATP splits into Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic Phosphate (Pi), releasing some energy. I'll explain more below how exactly this works.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How or why does ATP Hydrolysis release energy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If you take a look at a diagram of an ATP molecule, you'll notice that it has 3 phosphate groups, each with a Hydroxyl group (-OH) that has a net negative charge due to Oxygen being highly electronegative and hogging electrons from the Hydrogen bonded to it. Consequently, you have 3 molecules with slightly negative charges attached to each other. If you've ever played with magnets, you'll know that like charges repel. So overall, the ATP is highly unstable because of these repulsive forces that are situated so close to each other. When the bond between the 2 inorganic phosphates is broken, a large amount of energy is released. Here's a diagram from Campbell's Biology 9th ed (note that the Hydrogens in the phosphates are not shown for simplicity):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oKgSz.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oKgSz.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>When the last phosphate is broken off, you are left with one molecule of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate group (Pi). Energy has been released. However, this is not the entire story. Generally speaking, ATP Hydrolysis does not occur without another component: an endergonic process. An endergonic metabolic process is any which requires energy input in order to proceed. Think of it with the following analogy: imagine a ball trying to roll uphill by itself. At the bottom of the ramp, the ball is very stable and has low potential for performing work. But uphill, the ball would have a higher potential energy. It is impossible for the ball to roll uphill from a state of low energy to a state of high energy. Thus, we first need an input of energy--say the mechanical energy of our hand pushing the ball--in order for it to move up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our endergonic process (such as in protein synthesis by a ribosome or the phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis, the first step of cellular respiration) requires some energy input from ATP in order to proceed in an exergonic manner--that is, in order to release energy without any help. With our analogy, this is like pushing the ball to the top of the ramp and then letting go, allowing the ball to roll back down from a state of very high potential energy (and therefore instability) to a state of low energy. The energy that we had to input from ATP is known as \"activation energy\", because it's literally energy that we need in order to unlock or \"activate\" an endergonic pathway.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Example of ATP Hydrolysis releasing heat:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>When you have an infection in your body, your hypothalamus will raise the body's set temperature point to induce shivering. Shivering consists of many muscle contractions, all of which require hydrolysis of ATP. The result is a release of a large amount of heat that increases body temperature to a point at which pathogens cannot survive.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What about blood flow?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Blood flow does not actually produce heat by itself, but it can direct heat to the surface of the skin, such as when the body needs to cool down. The main source of heat in the body remains the ATP.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: much of the information here can be reviewed in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhuqXwvFv2E\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> wonderful YouTube video by Andrew Douch<\/p>\n","answer_id":43598,"question_id":43591,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1456316778},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456348084,"creation_date":1456348084,"body":"<p><em>Is heat released during work due to ATP breakdown or a increased blood flow<\/em>?<\/p>\n\n<p>Short answer: neither. Most of the heat generated is due to poor efficiency of metabolism.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a common misconception that ATP is the same thing as energy when it comes to metabolism. ATP is certainly a very important energy carrier, but human metabolism is far from efficient at capturing the energy in nutrients in the form of ATP. A large fraction of the energy stored in sugar, fat, or other substrates is lost as heat already in the process of <em>making<\/em> ATP, much in the same way a car engine runs warm because most of the energy in gasoline cannot be captured in a useful form.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is thought that most of the heat produced during oxidative metabolism (as in muscle contraction) occurs during respiration and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. This is probably because the mitochondrial respiratory chain involves physical pumping of protons across membranes (chemiosmosis) which causes a lot of \"friction\" (rougly speaking). <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9234964\" rel=\"nofollow\">This review<\/a> estimates that only about 1/3 of the heat generated comes from ATP utilization and downstream processes, like actin-myosin contractions.

I was so over joyed but it was short lived-no explanations were offered.  I now offer a possible explanation. Yes, lectins are proteins(or glycoproteins) and like most proteins their tertiary and quaternary structures are 3D. So the 3D forms have a couple of smaller subunits, woven together into the giant super structure(lectin). In the 3D form, most of the binding sites are \"buried\" or not fully exposed. It is possible that these smaller units have binding sites for carbs and are best positioned to present their ligands for  exposure and maximal binding when the 3D structure begins to \"melt down\". This melt down occurs at low temperature when denaturation has actually started.  Thus, the greater the exposure  number of subunits bearing the binding sites, the greater the potentiation. My work used low temperature extrusion cooking and the observation occurred in the extrusion cooking.<\/p>\n\n<p>I just hope this suggestion is adequate. That is indeed the explanation I am going to offer for my observation anyway.

You isolate the mutants based on phenotype, and perform a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q42E5MzgCaE\" rel=\"nofollow\">complementation test<\/a> to determine if the mutation was on the same gene or different genes.

Eventually the hope is that such screens would reach a large enough scale that most or all newly generated mutations would represent a second hit of a locus, essentially saturating the genome with mutations. This type of saturation mutagenesis within classical experiments was used to define sets of genes that were a bare minimum for the appearance of specific phenotypes.

In many cases a ND can be approximated because the variance would be so less that you can practically find no negative values. However, it is a wrong assumption to consider all biological statistics as ND by default. Please see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/37199/3340\">this<\/a> post. Basically, ND approximations can be made on multiple measurements that follow the central limit theorem. Now, in your case of a ND centered at 1, I'll tell you how that is impossible. You can have 2 and more than 2 mutations but you cannot have less than 0 mutations. The distribution is not symmetric and is skewed towards right. You also cannot have fractional mutations and therefore the distribution has to be discrete and not continuous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutagenesis itself can be modelled as a Poisson process. For more information on this please see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/36499/3340\">this post<\/a>.

Each specific software has it's own problems and advantages and may not fit into the below categories.

We'll round up with how <em>ab initio<\/em> is probably going to become realistically involved in reliable protein predictions.<\/p>\n\n<h1><em>Ab intio.<\/em><\/h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gqeyh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gqeyh.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the flow charts of comparative modelling versus *Ab initio* modelling.\"><\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p>Figure showing the broad pipeline difference between <em>ab initio<\/em> and homology modelling.<a href=\"http://isw3.naist.jp/IS/Bio-Info-Unit/gogroup/study/study-en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nara Institute of Science and Technology.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Ab initio<\/em> often works on the premise that physical laws can be applied universally in biology. As you are most probably aware, biochemistry is far messier than chemistry and often those physical laws appear bent if not completely broken. The goal of <em>ab initio<\/em> is therefore to combine physical properties with some fudge factors to account for a complex system. Due to the complexity of the system never being fully modelled, <em>ab initio<\/em> predictions are limited to what your input is. There are also limitations pointed out in the 2009 article:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>potential energy functions.<\/li>\n<li>conformational search engines <\/li>\n<li>model selection scheme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>What you can see now is that <em>ab initio<\/em> is missing something that the others have: biological experimental empiricism. Without that inductive reasoning <em>ab initio<\/em> modelling is very vulnerable to assuming far too much and oversimplifying the system (<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/793/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This xkcd springs to mind<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Although perfect <em>ab initio<\/em> prediction is the \"Holy Grail\" of protein structure prediction, currently if there is homology which provides an experimentally known structure then that is often more reliable.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Ab initio<\/em> is not completely without merit. For relatively short proteins (100 residues) the accuracy has improved over the last decade (Lee <em>et al.,<\/em> 2009). From the above mentioned article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the physics-based atomic potentials have proven to be useful in\n  refining the detailed packing of the side chain atoms and the peptide\n  backbones.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h1>Homology modelling.<\/h1>\n\n<p>This type of modelling is a safe bet provided that the MSA is available and reliable. The premise here is that if two proteins look similar enough at a sequence level, and you know the structure of one, then probably there is structural conservation as well. The problem is that obviously, those small changes in sequence, or other contextual differences like post translational modifications, localised pH differences etc. might mean that the protein folds differently.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Machine Learning.<\/h1>\n\n<p>Neural networks are a form of machine learning. Conceptually, these use the same assumptions as homology modelling, but on a larger more sophisticated scale (not necessarily an advantage). A good example of \u201cmachine learning\u201d winning out in terms of homology clustering and secondary structure prediction is that of <a href=\"http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred\" rel=\"nofollow\">HHpred<\/a>. An algorithm will make subsets of \"if\" statements. If a protein has a certain combination of \"ifs\" and \"nots\" then it's safe to assume other proteins with the same \"ifs\" and \"nots\" have similar structures. <\/p>\n\n<p>You need to know a lot of information about the dataset that you put in, and also one needs to know which of that information is relevant. If these conditions aren't thoroughly complied with the categorisation results will just be amplified errors, arbitrary categorisations, missing categories, or a combination of those three.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's worth pointing out at this point that most modern secondary structure predictors use a combination of homology and machine learning.<\/p>\n\n<h1>A reasonable <em>ab initio<\/em> approach.<\/h1>\n\n<p>More recently iterative optimisation based on vague experimental data has become the standard practice shifting <em>ab initio<\/em> from a top down approach to something more inductive. <a href=\"http://hjklol.mit.edu/sites/default/files/pub_reprints/15_jp307741u_sm.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kulic <em>et al.,<\/em> 2012<\/a> is an interesting example of such a modern holistic approach.

The nervous system tissue has the best conductor properties from the body. More than that, it works with action potentials, which are small chemical generated currents.

Hence there is no natural immunity available in the population and a lot of infections occur. Once this \"first wave\" of infections is over, the level within the population will fall drastically. Some more information on this topic can be found <a href=\"http://blog.oup.com/2016/01/zika-virus-pandemic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is of course possible that the Zika virus has acquired a new mutation which adapts it better to humans and allows spreading much easier, but this is not yet known, since the situation in South America is still changing very fast with a lot of cases occurring and analysis going on. It still can be enough that the virus never emerged in Southern America and that there is no natural immunity available. <\/p>\n\n<p>According to the paper in reference 1 (which is only a brief communication) the sequences of the envelope proteins of the virus are similar to the strains circulating in Asia and do not carry novel mutations:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ipxDB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ipxDB.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The Surinam strains are the ones published in the paper mentioned above and are from South America. I haven't (yet) found any other analysis, but this will only be a matter of time. At the moment we cannot make a final statement on this although there is some speculation around.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit 23/02/2016: There is still no final conclusion available, but there is an interesting paper available on the Biorxiv-Preprintserver, which analyses the mutation rate in the genomes of the publically available strains. It can be found in reference 2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on the available genomes, the author calculates the mutation rate of the Zika virus to about 10 Mutations/year. The virus is a RNA virus which have generally higher mutation rates than DNA viruses.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the analysis he finds a number of non-synonymous mutations (mutations which lead to a basepair exchange), as seen in table 2:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9uOFe.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9uOFe.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Especially named is the M2634V mutation, but since this is in one of the envelope proteins, the author finds it relatively unlikely (although not completely), that this causes a much higher mutation rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the Diskussion of the paper he writes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sudden spread of Zika to South and Central America does not appear\n  to have been due any particular change in the mosquito vector or\n  anything to make the Zika virus itself more virulent. But rather from\n  the fact that infected people are now able to fly rapidly from country\n  to country, thereby spreading the disease extremely easily. This means\n  there is little to stop the epidemic continuing to spread to further\n  areas of population which have little, if any, herd immunity against\n  the virus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2816%2900003-9/fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zika virus genome from the Americas<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/02/19/040303\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZIKA - How Fast Does This Virus Mutate ?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":42894,"question_id":42891,"up_vote_count":22,"last_edit_date":1456257706},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30ae076937122c48a1c854d4901c790b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8149,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8149/user568458","reputation":390,"display_name":"user568458"},"score":14,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acb3c0063d438705f86396a8abc1b04a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12877,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12877/cmosychuk","reputation":4410,"display_name":"CMosychuk"},"score":1,"post_id":42897,"edited":false,"creation_date":1454425199,"comment_id":73999,"body":"It&#39;s been a profound backdrop to the American anti-vaccine movement I&#39;ve witnessed, when you see what happens in a population with no intrinsic immunity.

If I understand, though, you want to know why <em>cellular<\/em> metabolic activity that takes places after someone dies? <\/p>\n\n<p>If that's the case, the answer is essentially that whatever kills a complex organism in the sense of causing the heart to cease beating, doesn't immediately cause every cell in the body to stop functioning at the same moment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now for a slightly longer answer...Consider someone who suffers a heart attack and dies. Blood stops flowing through their veins and cessation of breathing means gas exchange stops. For cells with extremely sensitive oxygen and nutrient demands like cardiac cells, cell death begins to occur rapidly. Other cells farther down the blood and oxygen supply chain have a greater tolerance to disruptions in nutrient supply and would have at least some store of nutrients to work with after blood flow stops. Those cells will keep doing whatever they were doing for a little while; metabolizing nutrients, transporting metabolites, transcribing genes, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a while, though, even they will feel the lack of oxygen. At that point, most cells will switch over to anaerobic respiration. The eukaryotic fraction of cells in our body isn't particularly good at this, but can struggle on for a little bit until they simply run out of fuel and begin to die, largely through apoptosis. <\/p>\n\n<p>Apoptosis of some cells will actually help prolong the lives of some of the cells neighboring the apoptotic ones, an effect that probably encouraged the evolution of apoptosis. After a while, though, too much apoptosis will have occurred and an uncontrolled sort death called necrosis will begin, leading to cascades of cell death and cessation of cellular metabolic activity. This process can take days to occur, depending on many variables surrounding the death of the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far, this has all been about eukaryotic cells; cardiocytes, adipocytes, myocytes, etc. These are the smallest fraction of cells in our body, by cell count. The rest of our bodies are composed of prokaryotic, or bacterial cells. This is our microbiome and this is where (for me) things get really interesting. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although our microbiome exists in a symbiotic relationship with our eukaryotic cell fraction, many members of the microbiome are less dependent on the nutrients found in our blood system than those eukaryotic cells. The cells of our microbiome are also frequently much more capable of surviving in low-oxygen or even anaerobic environments. These parts of us will continue to thrive for some time after we \"die\". <\/p>\n\n<p>Some of our microbial cells, if left to their own devices, could even find new environmental niches outside our bodies and continue to live long after \"we\" have died. The quotes around 'die' and 'we' become necessary at this point because from here, questions of identity and life branch into the philosophical. <\/p>\n\n<p>This became a lengthy answer, but I find it a really interesting topic. Here's a nice article from the Guardian, that discusses post-mortem cellular metabolism and our microbiomes in particular: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/05/life-after-death\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/05/life-after-death<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":43556,"question_id":43554,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7205dbeae104ab892240171b08e1c6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":22053,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22053/user22053","reputation":11,"display_name":"user22053"},"score":0,"post_id":43560,"edited":false,"creation_date":1456152738,"comment_id":75426,"body":"I would like to know what happen in the brain exactly"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":43560,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7205dbeae104ab892240171b08e1c6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":22053,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22053/user22053","reputation":11,"display_name":"user22053"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1456152808,"comment_id":75427,"body":"@user22053 - you really have to be more specific than that -"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456154394,"creation_date":1456148849,"body":"<p>To elaborate on the comments - I think the question hinges on the definition of 'death'. <\/p>\n\n<p>A <strong>brain-dead<\/strong> person is considered <strong>clinically dead<\/strong>.

They may contract cancer with an incidence less than that estimated by absolute cell numbers, but there seems to be a lack of data on cancer rates in large animals to support this hypothesis conclusively.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nWhales contract cancer <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Martineau <em>et al<\/em>, 2002)<\/a>. There does, however, seem to be a lack of correlation between body mass and cancer risk, which is counterintuitive since larger animals have more cells. This is known as <strong>Peto\u2019s paradox<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060950/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Caulin &amp; Maley, 2011)<\/a>, after epidemiologist Richard Peto of Oxford University in the UK, who noted it in the 1970s. He reasoned that larger organisms have more potentially carcinogenic cells, tend to live longer and require more ontogenic cell divisions. Therefore, statistically, cancer incidence should scale with body size <a href=\"http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/2/317.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Nagi <em>et al<\/em>., 2007)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is thought that larger animals use protective mechanisms that many smaller animals do not. For example, blue whales have 1000 times more cells than us, if they would contract cancer at rates 1,000 times higher than humans, they would die before they were able to reproduce and the species would quickly go extinct. However, the paradox itself has been scrutinized, because there may simply be a lack of data on cancer rates in large animals (Source: <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/massive-animals-may-hold-secrets-of-cancer-suppression-1.12258\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature News, 2013<\/a>). In addition, it is thought that malignant tumors are disadvantaged in larger hosts. In larger organisms, tumors may need <strong>more time to reach lethal size<\/strong>, so tumors have more time to evolve without becoming lethal. Hence, in large organisms, <strong>cancer may in fact be more common, but less lethal<\/strong> <a href=\"http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/2/317.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Nagi <em>et al<\/em>., 2007)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The persistent myth that sharks don't get cancer seems to stem from clinical evidence that cartilage has antiangiogenic properties, i.e., it inhibits the development of blood vessels, which are crucial to the growth of many cancerous tumors. Since shark skeletons are made of cartilage, it was thought that they can't get cancer. Recent studies have found that while the incidence of cancer in sharks and related fishes such as rays does seem to be low, cancerous tumors, including chondromas (cancers of the cartilage), have in fact been found in sharks. The reasons for the apparently low incidence are not necessarily related to their high cartilage content, but may simply be a matter of <strong>lack of directed research on cancer<\/strong> in sharks and related fishes (Source: <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/learn/pd/sharks_rays/rfl_myth/myth_page6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Museum of Natural History<\/a>). Indeed, tumors have been found in 23 species of sharks, measuring up to 30 cm in a Great White (Source: <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sharks-do-get-cancer-tumor-found-great-white/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scientific American, 2013<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060950/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caulin &amp; Maley, <em>Trends Ecol Evol<\/em> (2011); <strong>26<\/strong>(4): 175\u201382<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martineau <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Environ Health Perspect<\/em> (2002); <strong>110<\/strong>(3): 285\u201392<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/2/317.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nagi <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Integr Comp Biol<\/em> (2007); <strong>47<\/strong>(2): 317-28<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><sub>P.S.

Where there is a reason to know, there is a reason to study something.<\/p>\n\n<p>The esophagus, on the other hand, is normally an area of rapid transport (a pill, or a fluid, for instance, is in the esophagus less than 10 seconds). While it's assumed that some pregastric absorption through the esophagus occurs and might be beneficial to avoid a \"first pass\" metabolism of the drug by the liver, there is no good method to keep a drug in the esophagus. With that in mind, absorption from the sublingual mucosa (where a pill might be held) is more valuable than what might get absorbed in as little as 6 seconds in transit to the stomach. From that point, it will spend significant amounts of time in the stomach, the various sections of the small intestine, and the large intestine.<\/p>\n\n<p>Absorption of drugs from the rectum has been studied, because it can be used, once again, as a method of drug delivery when another route for whatever reason cannot,<\/p>\n\n<p>Esophageal motility disorders occur, so studies of esophageal function are common. But as the esophagus is <em>never<\/em> normally the place for absorption of nutrients, there is no reason to study it except for the sake of satisfying pure curiosity. Studies take time, involve volunteers (or paid recipients), risk, and money. Pure curiosity <em>is<\/em> a reason to study something.

Life in the water would die.<\/p>\n\n<p>If there were no life in water, then life on land would be most difficult. (Consider most of our oxygen comes from phytoplankton in the oceans.
