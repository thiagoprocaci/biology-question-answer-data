Opening two sentences are worth quoting here:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The human glans penis is covered by stratified squamous epithelium and\n  a dense layer of connective tissue equivalent to the dermis of typical\n  skin. Rete ridges of the epidermis are irregular and vary in height\n  depending on location, age, and presence or absence of a foreskin. The\n  papillary layer of the dermis blends into and is continuous with the\n  deep connective tissue forming the tunica albuginea of the corpus\n  spongiosum of the glans penis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And as @TheLastWord pointed out, foreskin covers the penis if you look at humans in an evolutionary scale of time.  The exception being an erection, which should lead to foreskin retraction (at least at some level).<\/p>\n\n<p>So the question then becomes is the squamous epithelium and connective tissue more prone to infection than the dermis.  First it's worth pointing out that the epidermis is not equally protective across the body. Think about the skin on your face vs the bottom of your foot.  Or vs a baby's.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think comparing the glans penis directly to the surrounding tissue, in our case the prepuce (foreskin), fussa navicularis, and urethra, makes the most since.  To make a plumbing analogy is it the pipe (urethra), the fitting (glans penis), hole (fussa navicularis), or insulation (prepuce) that is most prone to infection?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well first we need to look at our pathogen, \"what's doing the infecting?\" For HIV probably <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187317\" rel=\"nofollow\">the urethra<\/a>, but if your interested in bacterial infection, the best things to look into are balanitis and balanoposthitis.  That would be the inflammation of the glans or glans+prepuce. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1195642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a good review<\/a> on infectious causes.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there is going to a strong sampling bias due to circumcision rates.  Also most studies are not going to be asking the the specific question we are trying to awnser here. And it would be hard to prove that infection occurred during the erection, not immediately before or after.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have found little evidence of bacterial infection of the prepuce but not the glans penis.  I do know of cases of the reverse however, which may indicate that the glans has a greater infection rate. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I think it's worth pointing out the difference is not likely to be drastic, and that the surface of glans has many similarities to skin.  For example it has an epidermis and dermis. It stretches quite well, and I think dryness will be an issue far before porosity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26064,"question_id":25858,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1419059156}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25858/skin-porosity-in-glans-penis-when-erect","last_activity_date":1419059156,"creation_date":1418526449,"answer_count":2,"title":"Skin porosity in glans penis when erect","body":"<p>(Apologies if this is a too weird/inappropriate question in this forum.

For instance, the rate of evolution will be affected by the rate of mutation, the distribution of positive and deleterious mutations, strength of selection, whether the fitness effects are small or large, if fitness effects depend on interactions between multiple mutations or single mutations with large effect, asexual vs. sexual populations, and processes such as genetic drift.<\/p>\n\n<p>A recent review that is useful for your question is <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713002322#\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Lanfear et al. 2014. Population size and the rate of evolution. TREE 29(1): 33\u201341\">Lanfear et al (2014)<\/a>. They focus on how substitution rate is affected by effective population size, and go through both theoretical and empirical evidence. They conclude that in most cases, most mutations are deleterious, and that drift and selection are the most important effects in determining rates of evolution. They also state the effect of effective population size (N<sub>e<\/sub>) is likely to depend if mutations are dominated by deleterious or advantagious mutations, and they expect the rate of evolution to be negatively correlated with N<sub>e<\/sub> when deletious mutations dominate evolution and a positive correlation to N<sub>e<\/sub> when advantagious mutations dominate.<\/p>\n\n<p>A paper by <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001715\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Rozen et al. 2008. Heterogeneous Adaptive Trajectories of Small Populations on Complex Fitness Landscapes . Plos One. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001715\">Rozen et al (2008)<\/a> indicates that while large populations are more effective in fixing mutations with large positive effects, small populations can be more effective in complex \"rugged\" adaptive landscapes.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While such determinism speeds adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive landscapes characterized by complex environments.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, this does not deal directly with the rate of evolution, but mostly about attaining the highest possible fitness in a particular fitness landscape.

However, they find (for asexual bacteria) that the speed of adaptation scales less than linearly with population size, and similar results have also been found in studies from Lenski's group.

The effect is caused by <strong>adaptation<\/strong> of the (in this case green) cones in the retina. This adaptation occurs through <strong>photobleaching<\/strong>, which means that the chromophore (cis-retinal) in the visual pigment in the cones is converted to the inactive state (trans-retinal). The conversion of retinal forms the basis of the detection of photons by the cones. When you look at a green stimulus for a long time, the photopigment in the green cones is progressively converted to the inactive trans-retinal state and the green cones will stop responding to the green light stimulus. Why then does this lead to a pink'ish (magenta) perception of white? This is because color vision is based on color opponency. <\/p>\n\n<p>The visual system in the retina is based on <strong>three cones<\/strong>: red, green and blue cones.<\/p>\n\n<p>These cones feed into three channels: a <strong>red-green<\/strong>, a <strong>yellow-blue<\/strong> and an achromatic (<strong>luminance<\/strong>) channel. Note that yellow is formed by adding the red-green color signal, while the achromatic channel is formed by adding the red and green cones as well, where only light intensity information is extracted.<\/p>\n\n<p>The red-green and yellow-blue channels are opponent channels. For your specific example, the latter is important. Red-green opponency means that at the neural level, red responses cancel green responses and vice versa. Therefore, we are not able to perceive a \"reddish green\". White is perceived when light activates all cones, such that red cancels green, green cancels red and yellow cancels blue. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, if the green cone system is adapted due to the green pigment being bleached, the opponency of green is diminished and the red response will dominate. In addition, as the yellow channel will be reduced as well, there will be a bit of blue added as well due to reduced blue suppression, explaining the pink'ish (i.e., magenta) appearance you describe. A nice example of the negative after-effect is the following: <\/p>\n\n<p>Stare at the colored dots on the girl's nose in the negative photo image below for 30 seconds.

The polyA based technique had reads that were single end and only 75bp long. This is compared to the other protocol which was 100bp paired.

However, there will not be as much certainty in the alignments, as there is a greater chance it will align to multiple locations in the genome, or align to the wrong location. So yes they have more reads aligned but I would be hesitant to make any conclusions from this. And if you look at total numbers of reads, the non-polyA method aligned more.

Random hexamers will give you non-coding RNA which is important in some experiments, and that is its main advantage. It will also give more uniform coverage across the gene (no 3' bias). Poly(A) selection will give you only mRNA, however you will miss any transcripts that are degraded or partially degraded. If you have a high quality sample or a large amount of starting material this is less of a concern. As mentioned before you end up missing parts of the 5' end on some transcripts with this method. If you have a low abundance transcript that you are trying to find, polyA selection is probably best, as it is more likely to be captured and you will capture the whole thing, rather than just getting bits and pieces of it with random hexamers.

A reinforcer is something that, when presented after a behavior, causes the probability of that behavior's occurrence to increase.

A reward can be defined as reinforcer only if its delivery increases the probability of a behavior.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason why we are happy when we get these decorative items is because they are things which we can possess.

When we have more badges usually our charisma increases like in the case of reputation.

The structures creating its distinctive pattern are complete by the eighth month of gestation, but pigmentation continues into the first years after birth. The layers of the iris have both ectodermal and mesodermal embryological origin, consisting of (from back to front): a darkly pigmented epithelium; pupillary dilator and sphincter muscles; heavily vascularized stroma (connective tissue of interlacing ligaments containing melanocytes); and an anterior layer of chromataphores and melanocytes with a genetically determined density of melanin pigment granules. The combined effect is a visible pattern displaying various distinctive features such as arching ligaments, crypts, furrows, ridges, and a zigzag collarette. Iris colour is determined mainly by the density of the stroma and its melanin content, with blue irises resulting from an absence of pigment: longer wavelengths differentially penetrate while shorter wavelengths are reflected and scattered, a phenomenon resembling that which makes the sky blue. The heritability and ethnographic diversity of iris colour have long been studied, but until the present research, little attention had been paid to the achromatic pattern complexity and textural variability of the iris among individuals. <\/p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jgd1000/anatomy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Iris Recognition vs. Retina Scanning<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Iris and retinal scanning are ocular based biometric identifiers.

Usually cells stop dividing, when their telomeres get too short to avoid chromosomal damage, due to the progressive shortening of the chromosomes. In cancer cells the pathways controlling this (for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53\" rel=\"nofollow\">p53<\/a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma_protein\" rel=\"nofollow\">retinoblastoma<\/a> pathway) are often mutated, so that the cells divide forever.

By this activation they get around reaching the Hayflick limit for the maximum number of cell divisions and are truly capable of living forever.

As far as I'm aware, there are many surface receptor molecules such as ephrins that are responsible for axonal guidance and dendritic repulsion in developing organisms such as flies (Drosophila). As you can tell this is extremely crucial since its important for neurons to spread their dendrites and axons as far as possible, evenly spaced out with axons bifurcating (separating) correctly and not sticking together. This is for example important in the Drosophila brain for axonal projections into different lobes.<\/p>\n\n<p>One such surface receptor, which helps achieving the above is Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) (schmucker et al 2000 Cell). Dscam gene is expressed in over 38000 isoforms (through complex alternative splicing of Dscam mRNA) in flies. It is the homophilic binding and subsequent repulsion of Dscam protein isoforms that enables an intrinsic self-recognition for repulsion of same-cell axon. As far as I understand it, if a number of similar Dscam isoforms are present on axons or dendrites of a neuron, this is self recognised and the dendrites and axons get repelled from one another.

Osmotic pressure is a measure of the tendency of water to move into one solution from another by osmosis. The higher the osmotic pressure of a solution, the more water tends to move into it. Pressure must be exerted on the hypertonic side of a selectively permeable membrane to prevent diffusion of water by osmosis from the side containing pure water.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the dehydrating effects of salt water, salmons drink several liters of water per day, but in fresh water salmons doesn't drinks at all. The only water it consumes is that which goes down when it feeds. When an ocean-dwelling salmon drinks, it takes in a lot of salt(NaCl), which exacerbates the salt-loading problem.\nIn fresh water, the salmon's kidneys produce large volumes of dilute urine, while in the ocean , the kidneys' urine production rates drop dramatically and produce a very concentrated urine.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Salmon use to deal with the NaCl fluxes driven by the gradients between the salmon and its surroundings. In their gill epithelial cells, salmon have a special enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to actively transport both Na+ and Cl- against their concentration gradients. In the ocean, these Na+-Cl- ATPase molecules 'pump' Na+ and Cl- out of the salmon's blood into the salt water flowing over the gills, thereby causing NaCl to be lost to the water and offsetting the continuous influx of NaCl. In fresh water, these same Na+-Cl- ATPase molecules 'pump' Na+ and Cl- out of the water flowing over the gills and into the salmon's blood, thereby offsetting the continuous diffusion-driven loss of NaCl that the salmon is subject to in fresh water habitats with their vanishingly low NaCl concentrations. <\/p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~toolson/salmon_osmoregulation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXzam.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rohlB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n  <a href=\"http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/assets/qualifications-and-standards/qualifications/ncea/NCEA-subject-resources/Biology/91604-B/91604-EXP-B-student3-001.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":25962,"question_id":23632,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23632/how-does-anadromous-fish-physiology-know-to-switch-from-salt-to-freshwater-and","last_activity_date":1418805918,"creation_date":1414810186,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does anadromous fish physiology \"know\" to switch from salt to freshwater and back?","body":"<p>What mechanism allows anadromous fish (like salmon) to switch from salt to fresh water and back?

However, whatever role bAPs play in the nervous system at large is subtle/small enough that we don't really understand them at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, as @luigi points out, pinched nerves don't have anything to do with bAPs. The reason why a pinch in one place (the neck) feels like it has an effect in another place (the arm) is because some neurons trace long (on the order of several feet) pathways through the body. Ultimately, the sensory input of everything below your head passes through neurons in your neck at some point. If there is a pinch in the neuron in your neck that relays sense information from your arm, that neuron in your neck can activate spuriously, even in the absence of any stimulus acting on your arm. In that case your brain will interpret the spurious activation of that neck neuron as being the result of some kind of strange arm stimulus, and so you feel pins and needles.<\/p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for more information on the sensory cortex in your brain and the \"sense image\" it maintains of your body.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Edit<\/h1>\n\n<p>To clarify what I mean by a \"pathway\", \n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iZHSE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The part marked \"proprioceptors or mechanoreceptors\" is what's buried in your skin. If you poke a mechanoreceptor, it evokes a signal in the neuron marked \"first-order\". In some cases, that first-order neuron will reach all the way to brainstem (as in the picture above), and in some cases that first-order neuron will interface with an intermediate neuron in the spine, but the effect is the same in any case. A first-order neuron stimulates a second-order neuron, which in turn stimulates a third-order neuron, etc., all the way until the original signal arising from the mechanoreceptor reaches the somatosensory cortex. A pinch in any of those first, second, etc. order neurons will potentially send spurious signals to the somatosensory cortex.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Second edit:<\/h1>\n\n<p>Rereading your question, I think a lot of the trouble that you're having has to do with your understanding of how the brain assembles sense information. In order to feel pain in your arm, it is not necessary for anything to be happening to the arm itself. Your arm could be perfectly healthy and normal, but as long as your brain is receiving a signal equivalent to the one produced by a damaged arm you will still feel the same sensation of pain.<\/p>\n","answer_id":25951,"question_id":25948,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1418789706}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25948/can-signals-travel-backwards-in-the-sensory-pathway","last_activity_date":1418789706,"creation_date":1418779225,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can signals travel \"backwards\" in the sensory pathway?","body":"<p>My <em>understanding<\/em> of the \"sensory pathway\" is that its a linear, directional pipeline as follows:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Nerves (fire various signals depending on the type of sensors they are)<\/li>\n<li>Fibers (transmit signals from nerves to spinal cord)<\/li>\n<li>Spinal cord (transmits signals from fibers to brainstem)<\/li>\n<li>Brainstem (transmits signals from spinal cord to brain)<\/li>\n<li>Brain (the somatosensory cortex register signals as pain/pressure/temperature/etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So again, my <em>understanding<\/em> is that sensory nerves are 1-way sensors, and that once they fire a signal, its 1 and only ultimate destination is the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, as a precursor to my question, if anything I have stated is incorrect, please begin by correcting me!<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I read that pinched nerves in the back and neck can cause <em>neuropathy<\/em> (\"pins and needles\") all over the body: hands, feet, face, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>But how can this be?<\/strong> If my understanding of the sensory pathway is correct, then a pinched nerve in one's neck should only send \"pins and needles\" signals directly to the brain; it should not at any point forward/relay signals on to any other areas of the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>To state that a pinched nerve in one's neck could possibly cause neuropathy in their arm, then that insinuates there is some connection between the pinched \"neck nerve\" and the nerve(s) in the arm that are experiencing the pins and needles sensation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, unless I completely misunderstand the entire sensory pathway and how pain signals transmit, this implies that a pinched nerve sends signals out to the spinal cord, <strong>down the spinal cord and into, say, an arm<\/strong>, and that the sensory receptors in the arm subsequently react to these signals.<\/p>\n\n<p>How is this possible?!?

Such competing structures can drastically reduce the efficiency of such experiments and are something that people try to avoid, e.g. by predicting secondary structures before choosing primers.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also methods that use short nucleic acids with attached labels such as fluorophores. Those labeled probes bind to specific target sequences, and you can then e.g. determine with a microscope where those probes are bound. In all such techniques you don't really want secondary structures in your probes as they interfere with the binding to the actual target.<\/p>\n\n<p>When RNA is introduced first, it is often said to be single-stranded and secondary structure is not even mentioned. But even when acting as messenger RNA, secondary structure of RNA does play a role. One mechanism for transcription termination works by forming a stem-loop within a certain range of stability, and predicting those is necessary to predict the site where transcription is terminated.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also many types of regulatory RNAs, this is a very active and hot topic at the moment. The most well known are probably RNA interference (siRNA and miRNA), but there are also many ribozymes and especially in bacteria also riboswitches. I won't try to list the different types of regulatory RNAs here, there is a large number of different classes that are known, and new ones are still discovered. To understand those it is often necessary to know the secondary or tertiary structure of the RNAs. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can often at least create some hypotheses on how an RNA could work by looking at the secondary structure. In riboswitches for example you typically have an on- and an off-conformation, and those can often be explained by secondary structures.<\/p>\n\n<p>While the secondary structure is often not enough to understand how a specific RNA works, you still start by predicting it in most cases. In many cases you would additionally use experimental data to verify the prediction (e.g. SHAPE or inline probing). <\/p>\n\n<p>Determining the actual three-dimensional structure of RNA is pretty hard. How hard depends heavily on the exact RNA, but it can easily take years to do this. If you're lucky you can crystallize it easily, but RNAs with flexible parts tend to not crystallize well. In that case you can do NMR to determine the structure, but that has a rather severe size-limitation and can easily take years for larger RNAs. <\/p>\n\n<p>In case of NMR, knowing the secondary structure is very useful in pretty much every case. You need to assign your signals to specific bases, and this is much easier if you know the secondary structure. You can also use NMR to support or disprove specific secondary structure predictions.<\/p>\n\n<p>More reliable secondary structure prediction would be pretty nice, the current methods still fail often enough. Though there is probably a limit on how good you can get such methods for RNAs with extensive tertiary structure. <\/p>\n","answer_id":25909,"question_id":25903,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25903/use-cases-of-rna-secondary-structure-prediction","last_activity_date":1418778276,"creation_date":1418701349,"answer_count":2,"title":"Use cases of RNA secondary structure prediction","body":"<p>I'm an undergraduate currently writing a thesis on RNA secondary structure prediction, specifically building upon analysis done by the <em>RNAStructure<\/em> and <em>Unafold<\/em> software packages by modifying certain algorithms here and there.

IBS is also associated with other gut-related symptoms including: bloating,nausea,and excessive gas.

These physical changes cause the \n  gut-brain to send signals to the brain which in turn promote further stress and distress, most commonly in the form of anxiety.For individuals with IBS (or actually most gut conditions), the ongoing worry about their gut and unproductive patterns can be very\n  debilitating.

There is in any case not definitive answer yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>An estimate of ssTFs genes in humans is given in the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19274049\">Nature Reviews Genetics<\/a> paper by Vaquerizas, JM et al, <em>A census of human transcription factors: function, expression and evolution<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>An excerpt from the abstract:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The numbers are somewhat higher now. Wingender et al. have counted 1,558 human genes in their <a href=\"http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/tfclass\">TFClass<\/a> database <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23180794\">2013 NAR paper<\/a>. In their <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361979\">2014 NAR paper<\/a> they included 1,557 human, 1,147 mouse and 1,105 rat orthologs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another way to look for this information is to see the number of entries listed in TF databases, like for example <a href=\"http://jaspar.genereg.net\">JASPAR<\/a>. This has the advantage of including other species. However, the coverage here depends on the availability of position weight matrices (PWMs) for the binding specificities. Many uncharacterized TFs may not be found.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To try to answer your third question, that is, what is the proportion of TFs in the different species, a naive approach would be to divide the number of predicted TFs by the number of predicted genes in the target genome. For example, taking the latest estimates above with the predicted number of coding genes from <a href=\"http://www.ensembl.org\">Ensembl<\/a> database (version 78) will return these percentages:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code># Human\n100 * 1557 / 20364 = 7.64%\n# Mouse\n100 * 1147 / 22606 = 5.07%\n# Rat\n100 * 1105 / 22777 = 4.85%\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This suggests humans have a slightly higher proportion of TFs than rodents. However, these differences are not too big and may be dependent on the accuracy of the different estimates on TFs and gene numbers. An in itself, these numbers are not so interesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>A much more interesting question is whether TF families have expanded more or less in different species (that is, whether the number of  proteins within each family has increased, regardless of the proportion to the total number of genes in the genome). I could find at least <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16166257\">one paper<\/a> where this has been done systematically for several eukaryotic species, covering animals, plants and fungi, and focusing on TFs common to the ones found in plants. The main conclusion of the paper is that some TFs families have expanded more in plants than in other organisms. Quoted from the abstract:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To investigate if differences exist in the expansion patterns of TF gene families between plants and other eukaryotes, we first used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TFs to identify TF DNA-binding domains. These DNA-binding domains were then used to identify related sequences in 25 other eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, among 19 families that are shared between animals and plants, more than 14 are larger in plants than in animals. After examining the lineage-specific expansion of TF families in two plants, eight animals, and two fungi, we found that TF families shared among these organisms have undergone much more dramatic expansion in plants than in other eukaryotes. Moreover, this elevated expansion rate of plant TF is not simply due to higher duplication rates of plant genomes but also to a higher degree of expansion compared to other plant genes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":25808,"question_id":25799,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1418630826}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/25799/number-of-transcription-factor-genes-in-the-human-genome","last_activity_date":1418630826,"creation_date":1418348091,"answer_count":1,"title":"Number of transcription factor genes in the human genome","body":"<p>What is the number of the transcription factor genes present in the human genome?

Paresthesia is a diverse medical condition and the definitions seems too vague. Most of the books define Paresthesia as a symptom of some other disease. Mostly Paresthesia is categorized as transient or permanent. Paresthesia can arise from several causes like artery related, nerve related, migraine, vitamin B deficiency, brain related and may cause from side effects of other drugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Classification of transient and chronic Paresthesia is described in detail <a href=\"http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/29764.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nerve impulses require a healthy energy supply, known as the axonal transport system.

If pressure is put on the correct spot, though, all the tiny arteries, veins and capillaries that supply the nerves\u2019 nutrients become pinched off and the nerve cells begin to function abnormally.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Compression isn\u2019t the only thing that can cause limbs to fall asleep. Excessive vibration will also lead to paresthesia.

Mechanical irritation of a peripheral nerve can project\n  such sensations to their periphery.If the pressure on a peripheral\n  nerve provokes paresthesia, then a neuroma or chronic compression\n  occurs. If the pain is initiated by the movement of a joint, there may\n  be a ganglion affected by the process.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Reference : Neurological Differential Diagnosis -- Marco Mumenthaler<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The paresthesia mentioned in the question is transient, mostly paresthesia can happen in cold weather conditions or can happen when sitting in a particular position for long time. Several types of paresthesia exist and there are several reasons for the occurrence. But most of them are attributed to the strain in  peripheral nerve. When we stand up, the itching effects get increase and it slowly fades out, this is because when the nerve resulted in the formation of paresthesia is stressed more when we take a stand up poster. As some paresthesia is caused by the lack of blood supply, blood supply itself is not always causes paresthesia but there are cases when blood circulation to the nerve is interrupted and this may result in stress of nerve and which may cause paresthesia. These kinds of paresthesia is common and it only last for minutes. So when we stand up the tension to the nerve increases, also the blood pressure increases and blood is slowly available to the nerve. <strong>When we try to stand, the nerves are burdened with more tension and paresthesia increases but after sometime the blood flow become natural and paresthesia  diminishes slowly. Paresthesia   can be reduced by massage or applying pressure on the affected areas<\/strong>, all these are helpful for people having transient paresthesia.

It\n  disappears gradually as the pressure is relieved (1).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Whiplash: Paresthesias in the upper extremity may occur after\n  whiplash injury (2), a type of cervical soft tissue injury (3). Pujol\n  et al showed that 13% of patients with whiplash had associated\n  paresthesias (4). Recovery usually arises within 6 months after injury\n  (5).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Hyperventilation syndrome: Paresthesia constitutes 35% of presenting\n  complaints in patients with hyperventilation syndrome (6) and may\n  begin after as little as threeminute of hyperventilation (7). After\n  increasing the depth or frequency of respiration, www.intechopen.com72\n  Paresthesia the alkaline shift produced selectively increases Na+\n  conductance and ectopic discharges in normal cutaneous afferent nerves\n  can be induced (8). Other electrolytes, i.e. magnesium, potassium,\n  chloride, phosphate and bicarbonate, also demonstrated significant\n  changes in concentration (7).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Panic attack: Paresthesiae of the mouth, hands and feet are common,\n  transient symptoms of the related conditions of hyperventilation\n  syndrome and panic attacks. Ietsugu et al demonstrated that\n  paresthesia can be used as a reliable indicator of severe panic\n  attacks (9).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Transient ischemic attack (TIA): TIA may be manifested by\n  paresthesias. Several reasons may cause TIA such as thrombosis,\n  embolus, intravascular debris and blood vessels disruption. Perez et\n  al. reported the initial manifestation of cardiac myxoma can be\n  paresthesias caused by TIA (10). Post-ischemic paresthesia occurs when\n  hyper polarization by the Na+/K+ pump is transiently halted by\n  elevated extracellular K+. The electrochemical gradient for K+ is\n  reversed and inward transport of K+ triggers regenerative\n  depolarization (8).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Seizures: Paresthesia may happen during and after a partial seizure\n  (11). Treatment of seizures with vagus nerve stimulation can also\n  trigger paresthesias and is considered an adverse event associated\n  with this treatment modality (12).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Dehydration: At around 5% to 6% cumulative water loss, paresthesia\n  may occur.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\u2022 Insufficient blood supply: Circulatory disorders could lead to\n  transient or chronic paresthesia.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, there are many causes for paresthesia.

Because it is caused by restriction of blood flow, it may take time  for the blood the reach the area and oxygenate the nerves. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why does it get worse? Well, because the action of standing up causes the blood pressure and heart rate to increase, decreasing blood flow to the nerves (read the abstract of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2625838\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>). Another reason is that when standing up, there is increased pressure on the nerves, causing paresthesia. Together, these effects, may increase paresthesia for a few seconds. But when the blood flow becomes normal and the pressure on the nerve decreases, the paresthesia goes away.<\/p>\n\n<p>There you have it!

The reason for allometric relations can be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the square of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the cube of the scaling factor. As a result of this, cardiovascular and respiratory functions would be severely burdened.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In the case of flying animals, the wing loading would be increased if they were isometrically scaled up, and they would therefore have to fly faster to gain the same amount of lift. Air resistance per unit mass is also higher for smaller animals, which is why a small animal like an ant cannot be seriously injured from impact with the ground after being dropped from any height.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>As was elucidated by J. B. S. Haldane, large animals do not look like small animals: an elephant cannot be mistaken for a mouse scaled up in size. This is due to allometric scaling: the bones of an elephant are necessarily proportionately much larger than the bones of a mouse, because they must carry proportionately higher weight. To quote from Haldane's seminal essay On Being the Right Size, \"...consider a man 60 feet high...Giant Pope and Giant Pagan in the illustrated Pilgrim's Progress.... These monsters...weighed 1000 times as much as Christian. Every square inch of a giant bone had to support 10 times the weight borne by a square inch of human bone. As the human thigh-bone breaks under about 10 times the human weight, Pope and Pagan would have broken their thighs every time they took a step.\" Consequently, most animals show allometric scaling with increased size, both among species and within a species.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The giant monsters seen in horror movies (e.g., Godzilla or King Kong) are also unrealistic, as their sheer size would force them to collapse. However, the buoyancy of water negates to some extent the effects of gravity. Therefore, sea creatures can grow to very large sizes without the same musculoskeletal structures that would be required of similarly sized land creatures, and it is no coincidence that the largest animals to ever exist on earth are aquatic animals.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21961/why-do-small-organisms-make-faster-movements-than-big-organisms\">This post<\/a> talks about the reasons for the allometric relations between animal size and speed of movements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concerning the relation between heat loss and size, you might be willing to have a look to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kleiber's law<\/a>.

It is particularly relevant for insects as they have no hemoglobin, meaning that the oxygen has to be dissolved into their body liquid (mostly water) to be brought to the cells. From Henry's law, the concentration of a gas such as oxygen in a liquid is a function of the concentration of this gas in the atmosphere. Therefore, the highest is the oxygen concentration, the easiest it is to bring oxygen to all the cells of a big body and therefore the lowest is the cost of having a big body.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21557,"question_id":21541,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1418564055}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21541/what-governs-the-size-of-animal-bodies","last_activity_date":1418564055,"creation_date":1411387554,"answer_count":2,"title":"What governs the size of animal bodies?","body":"<p>Million of years ago there lived dinosaurs up to 36 m high.

You can do this using the <a href=\"http://infernal.janelia.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infernal package<\/a> to search the Rfam database of CMs. For those RNA sequences which match an Rfam CM, you can then use that CM to search the sequence databases for additional matches.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those that do not match an Rfam CM, you will want to build your own models. In order to do this you need to identify homologues for each sequence which you can use to produce an alignment from which a model can be built. In order to do this you will want to use a method which is RNA aware and uses a rigorous search method. For example from the <a href=\"http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FASTA suite<\/a>, which has an RNA mode which adjusts the scoring accordingly:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smith and Waterman<\/a> for local/local alignment (e.g. SSEARCH)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Needleman\u2013Wunsch<\/a> for global/global alignment (e.g. GGSEARCH)<\/li>\n<li>Hybrid alignment for global/local alignment (e.g. GLSEARCH)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Your coverage requirements and the nature of the database being searched will determine the most suitable method to use for the sequence similarity search. Combining the best search method with appropriate selection of the database to search, for example the <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)<\/a> provide a set of non-protein coding sequences (<a href=\"ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/non-coding/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/non-coding/<\/a>) derived from the annotations in EMBL-Bank that could be a good starting point your search. Will improve the sensitivity of your search.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given the set of homologous sequences you need to produce a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to generate a model from. To do this you will want to use an RNA aware MSA tool, for example <a href=\"http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects/rcoffee/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-COFFEE<\/a> or <a href=\"http://www.clustal.org/omega/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clustal Omega<\/a> in order to produce an alignment which attempts to take into account the folding of the RNA molecules.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given the alignment you can create a CM using Infernal or an HMM using <a href=\"http://hmmer.janelia.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HMMER<\/a>, and use this to search the sequence database (cmsearch or hmmsearch) to find additional homologues in the database.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13984,"question_id":13941,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1387114909},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbc094f163713d6e098765a12994b246?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9033,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9033/ganesh-ujwal","reputation":365,"display_name":"Ganesh Ujwal"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1418467572,"creation_date":1418467572,"body":"<p>PSI-BLAST creates a protein profile of similar proteins (essentially a scoring matrix based on multiple sequence alignments) that are then used for further DB searches.

Why?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If we take inbreeding as a higher than expected frequency of homozygotes, such that if the frequencies of alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ are $p = q = 0.5$ the expected frequencies of the genotypes in an outbred population, $P_{outbred}$, would be $p^2 = 0.25$, $2pq = 0.50$, and $q^2 = 0.25$. <\/p>\n\n<p>Each genotype has the following phenotypic result on a trait $A_1A_1 = 5$, $A_1A_2 = 7.5$, $A_2A_2 = 10$... this is an additive trait with allele $A_1$ having an additive effect of 2.5, and $A_2$ an additive effect of 5.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can then compare an inbred population of 100 individuals, $P_{inbred}$ where the frequency of $A_1A_1 = 0.5$, $A_1A_2 = 0$, $A2_A2 = 0.5$, to $P_{outbred}$ , where I use $\\bar{X}$ to symbolise trait means.<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\bar{X}_{inbred} = \\frac{(50 \\cdot 5) + (0 \\cdot 7.5) + (50 \\cdot 10)}{100} = 7.5$<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\bar{X}_{outbred} = \\frac{(25 \\cdot 5) + (50 \\cdot 7.5) + (25 \\cdot 10)}{100} = 7.5$<\/p>\n\n<p>So when the trait is additive the population means are equal. It is onlt when we add dominance to the situation that the population means will differ as a result of inbreeding. Continuing from the above example, the populations are the same size and structure, but $A_2$ is now completely dominant to $A_1$ such that $A_1A_2$ individuals now have a trait value of 10.

There is also a psychological component to override satiety signals (company during meals, appearance of food, cost, etc.). The best measure of satiety may well be <em>when a person stops eating a given meal<\/em>. In lab conditions, the meals are carefully calibrated, but people (and animals) can feed as long as they desire to (<em>ad lib<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Historically, satiety was thought to be the end product of serum glucose, available energy based on body heat, fat utilization by the liver, and the generation of ATP and other energy-rich molecules by the liver and/or brain. For the most part, these hypotheses have not withstood the test of time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Three major signals influence food intake: satiety signals, adiposity signals, and central effectors. For the sake of simplicity, I'll deal only with satiety signals. Satiety signals (SS) arise from the GI tract and related organs during a meal, and influence eating behavior by activating peripheral nerves passing from the GI tract to the brain, or by recognition by brain receptors.<sup>[1]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>As food interacts with the lining of the stomach and intestine, gut peptides and other signals that coordinate/optimize the digestive process are secreted. The signals that inform the CNS function as satiety signals. Different signals are secreted in response to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and it's the specific mix of signals that informs the brain as to what precisely has been eaten.<sup>[2]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the most extensively studied gastrointestinal satiety hormone. It is secreted by cells in the duodenum and jejunum in response to ingested fat and protein in chyme (food plus gastric fluid). Giving CCK IV decreases ad lib meal size, while blocking CCK receptor sites will increase ad lib eating per meal.<sup>[3]<\/sup><sup>[4]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>Carbohydrates and fats as the most effective stimulators of Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP-1) and Peptide YY (PYY). IV GLP-1 decreases meal size by promoting early satiety.<sup>[5]<\/sup> Within the CNS, PYY is detectable in the hypothalamus, medulla, pons, and spinal cord.<sup>[6]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Enterostatin is a protein which is broken down into a digestive lipase and a five-peptide fragment (Ala-Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg (APGPR) in humans). The appetite regulating effects of APGPR in the brain are specific to high-fat or fat diets but not towards diets rich in protein or carbohydrate.<sup>[6]<\/sup><sup>[7]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>Amylin decreases meal size in rats, probably through the same pathway as CCK. Oxyntomodulin (OXM) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are also meal terminators. Pre-prandial subcutaneous administration of OXM to overweight and obese humans over a 4-week period resulted in a significant reduction in body weight of 2.3\u2009kg, compared with 0.5\u2009kg for the placebo arm.<sup>[9]<\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a growing field, and there is more suspected, and more to prove. But one can see that there is no one measure of satiety.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>[1] That satiety signals come from the stomach and beyond was shown by \"fake eating\", that is, diverting swallowed food from the stomach by creating a fistula.

Even with <a href=\"http://misterguch.brinkster.net/MLX031.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">dirty methods<\/a>, you can re-extract the product several times, to sacrifice yield for purity. Just be very clean. Whatever method you use should remove salts and proteins, which are the major contaminants. I won't go too much into how to extract DNA, as that's a whole separate question - but the most important thing is that purer is better.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should resuspend in Tris-EDTA. Tris buffer maintains pH at slightly acidic (best for DNA) and EDTA chelates metal ions which can catalyze oxidative damage of DNA. Very pure distilled water works too, but if you get contaminants they will do more damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Afterwards you can store the DNA for quite some time provided it's frozen. At -20C you can store DNA for years. It may not be perfect quality when you pull it out a decade later, but most of it will be good, and I'm sure it will be okay if you use a good sequencing method (and I'm sure sequencing technology will advance more in 10 years than the degradation of your DNA). The good news is that you can simply store it in your freezer, and it will be okay. -20C particularly is not hugely important, you can probably get away with -10C or so - the crucial thing is for it to be frozen, not liquid (this vastly reduces diffusion).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to do it like a pro, you would put it under -80C. This is considered very safe for multiple years. You can do even better by precipitating it with ethanol, and then storing at -80C. In my opinion, this -80C is overkill - DNA is fine, for the most part, stored at -20C and even 4C, especially if you work reasonably clean and contamination-free. If you had some extremely valuable, very sensitive DNA, sure, do the -80. But just personal sequencing/genotyping? Just extract a bit extra DNA  (a couple micrograms).<\/p>\n\n<p>The really safe method is liquid nitrogen, which stops practically all chemical activity. Higher temperatures are too cold for most DNA-damaging reactions to proceed at a significant rate, but the molecules still move around. At -200C, they stop dead. But, once again, overkill unless you are saving very critical DNA for centuries later.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ogt.com/resources/literature/403_dna_storage_and_quality\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Three simple things I can recommend that are less obvious: First, do not handle your sample with hands, even gloved. Use some kind of plastic tweezers. Hands are warm and will locally warm up the sample. I would go as far as to put the sample tube in another box so that there is no direct contact. Second, avoid freeze/thawing. Whatever your storage system is, make sure it is very reliable. Third, wrap it in something opaque, to minimize light exposure.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Note as per Chris's comments:<\/em><\/strong> Always consult the MSDS of the substances you work with and take appropriate safety precautions!

Paul Leyhausen, a German animal behaviorist studied domestic cats (and related felines) from the 1950's through the 1970's, and much of what is known about their predatory behavior is thanks to him. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although their vision is not especially keen, domestic cats see well in dim light and readily perceive motion. According to Leyhausen, prey movement and the direction of movement are the only factors which innately release crouching, stalking, and catching behaviors in cats. When presented with quail, cats were far more likely to go after active quail than those stilled by tonic immobility. Cats are also more likely to go after smaller prey (mice > rats) and mice were much more likely to elicit play pawing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leyhausen also demonstrated that rodents were probably the natural prey of cats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though there has been much study of cats and predation, little is available on detail of the kind you are interested in.  My best guess for a good toy for a cat would be a smaller object that moved along the floor.<\/p>\n\n<p>More information can be obtained from Leyhausen's book, Cat Behavior: The Predatory and Social Behavior of Domestic and Wild Cats. <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163104780924565\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effects of the mother, object play, and adult experience on predation in cats<\/a><\/sub><br>\n <sub><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163104780924425\" rel=\"nofollow\">The effects of experience on the predatory patterns of cats<\/a><\/sub><br>\n <sub><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03212037#page-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tonic immobility in Japanese quail can reduce the probability of sustained attack by cats<\/a><\/sub><br>\n <sub><a href=\"http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Group/AnimPersInst/Animal%20Personality%20PDFs/A/Ademac%201975.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The behavioral bases of prolonged suppression of predatory attack in cats<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":24779,"question_id":16041,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16041/are-there-specific-features-of-birds-that-cats-small-predators-are-attracted-to","last_activity_date":1418312441,"creation_date":1395678255,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there specific features of birds that cats/small predators are attracted to?","body":"<p>I've recently heard a podcast, in which a professor describes <a href=\"http://careersuicideblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/how-abstract-art-attracts-the-chicks/\">one of the theories as to why we like abstract art<\/a>.
