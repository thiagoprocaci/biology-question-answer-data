When an AP is triggered locally, it spreads because the ions which travel across the membrane during the AP spike diffuse to neighbouring regions and trigger the same response in the ion channels there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, it is irrelevant where an AP is, it is always the same voltage. The 40mV are not \"distributed\" at all - they diffuse and cause new depolarisations around them, triggering new 40mV potentials until they reach the neuron terminals.

All terminals will have the same 40mV potential (the exact voltage of course may be different between cell types).<\/p>\n\n<p>Potentials which do not reach the threshold value are stored to some extent. This is in the sense that potentials around neurons are always established by ion gradients - a potential in your sense means a change in concentrations from the resting state.

The short answer to your question is that <em>each synaptic terminal sees the same voltage<\/em> because that voltage is generated \"fresh\" at each site. This has <em>nothing to do with synaptic strength<\/em>, which determines the amount of voltage deflection in the postsynaptic terminal but not in the presynaptic terminal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The axon has two major properties that allow for this even activation across its branches. First, as @Armatus said, the <strong>axon is an active structure<\/strong>, meaning that the action potential (AP) regenerates as it travels along the axon. This means that there is essentially no decay of the voltage as the AP propagates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, the <strong>axonal geometry<\/strong> appears to be carefully regulated. As you seem to have guessed, there has to be sufficient current flow to activate an action potential in the neighbouring patches of membrane or else there is a propagation failure and the AP stops. This is a problem at axonal branch points (see Box 1 in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn1397\">Debanne, 2004<\/a>), where the diameters of daughter branches have to be correctly sized so that there is little or no extra electrical load. (For instance, if one branch stays the same size as the mother, the other branch is an extra load that will \"steal\" current and leave less current travelling down the mother branch). Recent work using voltage-sensitive dyes have shown that in mammalian neurons, in practice, propagation failures are rare (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0552-10.2010\">Foust et al, 2010<\/a>). This suggests that there is fine regulation to ensure that the geometry is \"just right.\" (Those \"just right\" rules are basically governed by cable theory, which I've <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/852/72\">previously described here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n<p>To your last question, yes, <em>there is time-dependent decay of subthreshold potentials because the membrane is a capacitor<\/em> (~1 uF / cm^2). I wouldn't call this \"storage\" exactly, but it does work just like a capacitor in a circuit.

It seems your teacher was working off a caricature of what the theory of evolution actually says.  <a href=\"http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2057/demonstrable-and-repeatable-examples-of-evolution\">First of all, you should read Sklivvz's excellent answer at this question<\/a>.  Now to address the elephant in the room, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster\" rel=\"nofollow\">accident at Chernobyl only happened in 1986<\/a>.  <em>That was only 26 years ago<\/em>.  In that timeframe, noticeable effects in an animal population really would not be at all noticeable.  Furthermore, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677413/\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper cited by Marta Cz-C<\/a> actually shows that there <em>have<\/em> been some changes (in fungi though, not animals).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fungi seem to interact with the ionizing radiation differently from other Earth\u2019s inhabitants. Recent data show that melanized fungal species like those from Chernobyl\u2019s reactor respond to ionizing radiation with enhanced growth. Fungi colonize space stations and adapt morphologically to extreme conditions. Radiation exposure causes upregulation of many key genes, and an inducible microhomology-mediated recombination pathway could be a potential mechanism of adaptive evolution in eukaryotes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Read the rest of the paper for more information on how there have been some other slight changes to fungi at Chernobyl as well as other locations throughout the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now I am going to repeat a bunch of stuff <a href=\"http://factsnotfantasy.com/creationists.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">from one of my web pages that talks about evolution<\/a>.  This web page is set up mostly to deal with creationist arguments, however, the caricature is so severe as to warrant this.  As I said earlier, evolution is a <strong>population phenomenon<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution acts upon heritable variation of characteristics, and you can only have variation of this sort within a population. A single individual organism, at least if its a multicellular eukaryote, has a fixed genome. It can't change what it has inherited. But a large number of organisms can all have different genomes, and can disseminate variation via inheritance to the next generation. It is upon the population as a whole that evolution acts, with various mechanisms coming into play to remove some variations from the population, and propel other variations to numerical dominance within the population. The organisms in question remain part of that population, and within a generation, those organisms don't change. But the moment a new generation is produced, dissemination of variation can result in the appearance of a new feature in one or more members of that population. If that new feature leads to greater reproductive success for the organism possessing it, that feature spreads through the population, as more and more future offspring inherit it. Over time, the population changes, and more and more organisms with new features appear within that population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Understanding inheritance basics and mechanisms for changes (genes), we have all that is needed for the appearance of cladogenesis events. Split a decent sized population of living organisms into two, and let's call these new, separate populations A and B. Now let a barrier be erected between population A and population B, so that individuals from one cannot reproduce with individuals from the other. This barrier can be an insurmountable physical obstacle, for example, but this need not be the only form such a barrier can take. Now, first of all, there is no reason whatsoever to think that population A and population B will start off in identical states to begin with. After all, those two populations were derived from an original population comprising lots of organisms with different genomes, and the likelihood of population A and population B being identical at the start of this process is vanishingly small. Then, once our barrier is erected, and our populations are allowed to reproduce separately from that point on, there is no reason to think that those populations will move in the same direction in the long term. Indeed, it is far more likely that they will be subject to different environmental and ecosystem influences, and those different environmental and ecosystem influences will shape the long term heredity of those populations. Indeed, that's all that natural selection IS - it's a single, concise term used to encapsulate all of those environmental and ecosystem influences succinctly, and additionally to encapsulate the fact that those influences affect the inheritance of characteristics within a population over the long term.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, any two separated populations of living organisms, that originated from a single population, will diverge from each other. If the extant influences on those two populations are sufficiently different, that divergence will take place more rapidly. Eventually, we will arrive at a point where those two populations become sufficiently diverged from each other that individuals from population A can no longer produce viable offspring with individuals from population B, and vice versa. When this happens, we have a speciation event. Indeed, this has been observed taking place in the wild AND in the laboratory, and has been documented in the relevant scientific papers. So, if anyone wishes to assert that there are 'magic barriers' to speciation or other cladogenesis events, then reality doesn't agree.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will not have any animals giving birth to any radically different animals as a result of radiation.  Most changed sue to radiation will not provide any particular advantage to an animal anyway.  Also, a change may also be dependent on a previous change and require many generations to fully manifest.  <a href=\"http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/\" rel=\"nofollow\">All this was <em>demonstrated<\/em> by the long term evolution experiment led by Richard Lenski at Michigan State University<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So in essence, your teacher was just plain wrong.  As for the findings of the past 20 years, we are always learning more and more.  For instance, there has been an explosive capability in DNA analysis and sequencing, which has only provided more support for the theory of evolution.  A mechanism that Charles Darwin could not have had any idea about in his day and age, yet it perfectly supports his conclusions.

Not sure if there is any way to answer without specifying a definition for complexity.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is clear that everything is made of only the same few elements, so complexity must involve more than that. Do the number and position of identical molecules matter? If so, size matters and we would label a large jelly-fish as more complex than a cat and the air in a large hot-air ballon as more complex than any single living organism (assuming it is bigger).<\/p>\n\n<p>I think it is clear that this is <em>not<\/em> what is meant by biological complexity. Molecules acting identically should not count multiple times; the number of different molecules matters more than the mere number of molecules. But are immune cells really more complex simply because of a relatively minor difference that allows them to generate a wide variety of genetic variants?<\/p>\n\n<p>What about the variable coat color of a calico cat. Does the complex and non-repeatable (even with cloning) pattern mean it is complex, or does the fact that a simple genetic process underlies it mean it is simple.<\/p>\n\n<p>The difference in complexity of different representation of the same thing is a classic problem in information theory (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kolmogorov complexity<\/a>). The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter requires an infinite number of decimal digits to describe, but it is just a single geometric concept and it can be represented with one or two characters, as pi or <strong>π<\/strong>. This applies to the problem of using phenotypes to measure complexity -- the language and definitions we use to describe or to differentiate phenotypes determines what is complex and what is simple.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moving beyond a simple static snapshot case, biological complexity involves time-dependent evolution. The \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\" rel=\"nofollow\">game of life<\/a>\" demonstrates how simple rules + initial conditions yield apparent complex behaviors, and the beauty of fractals arises the same way. Many apparently complex organisms grow from small seeds plus time-evolved exposure to simple things like water and light and CO<sub>2<\/sub>. Are trees only as complex as the seed they grow from?<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, what about higher order complexity? One human brain is very similar in general makeup to another, but the concepts and memories stored seem complex and very different. Comparing the complexity of stored information between two people is the whole complexity problem over again.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that complexity can only be cleanly measured within a specific context, and then only relatively. One can measure the <em>relative genomic complexity<\/em> of two organism as the edit distance between the alphabetic sequences representing their genomes. The <em>relative regulatory complexity<\/em> can be measured as mentioned above by @user1682. Each of these says something about an organisms complexity. But what if organism A has higher genomic complexity and organism B has higher regulatory complexity? It might be possible to derive something like a principle component \"basis set\" from several of these kinds of measurements using a training set and a list of organisms with predefined complexity values. Applying this \"standard\" scoring metric to another organism would allow ranking it on a \"standard\" scale, but it would be difficult to generate and obtain consensus on the initial \"expert\" ranked organism scale. Such a standard might have some value, but is not really theoretically satisfying in that it describe an organisms complexity in the same way that the average of a small sample describes the distribution of a large population.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5351,"question_id":5300,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5300/what-measures-are-commonly-used-for-the-complexity-of-an-organism","last_activity_date":1353976493,"creation_date":1353586326,"answer_count":2,"title":"What measures are commonly used for the complexity of an organism?","body":"<p>I'm aware of measures like number of distinct cell types being used as a measurement of complexity in biology, for example in the G-value paradox.

A review in 2001 concludes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conversely, it is unlikely that leptin has evolved to prevent obesity\n  when plenty of palatable foods are available because the elevated\n  plasma leptin levels resulting from the increased adipose tissue mass\n  do not prevent the development of obesity. In conclusion, in humans,\n  the leptin signaling system appears to be mainly involved in\n  maintenance of adequate energy stores for survival during periods of\n  energy deficit. Its role in the etiology of human obesity is only\n  demonstrated in the very rare situations of absence of the leptin\n  signal (mutations of the leptin gene or of the leptin receptor gene),\n  which produces an internal perception of starvation and results in a\n  chronic stimulation of excessive food intake.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in a newer review it looks as if leptin is involved in more processes than mere survival:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cloned in 1994, the ob gene encodes the protein hormone leptin, which\n  is produced and secreted by white adipose tissue. Since its discovery,\n  leptin has been found to have profound effects on behavior, metabolic\n  rate, endocrine axes, and glucose fluxes. Leptin deficiency in mice\n  and humans causes morbid obesity, diabetes, and various neuroendocrine\n  anomalies, and replacement leads to decreased food intake, normalized\n  glucose homeostasis, and increased energy expenditure.

I don't think you would find a square kilometer with no organisms though. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are organisms (called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile\">extremophiles<\/a>) that thrive in the most hostile environments we know, they can survive extreme heat, cold, acidity, salinity etc. I found <a href=\"http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/poster/poster_images/astrobioactivity1-studenthandout.pdf\">this very nice list<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Cold \u2013 The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are some of the coldest, driest deserts on Earth, with average annual temperatures of\n  -20oC (-4oF) and less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) of precipitation a year. Scientists have found bacteria in liquid water pockets\n  embedded about twelve feet deep in \u201csolid\u201d lake ice. Some of these\n  bacteria use chemical nutrients from particles of dirt in the ice and\n  use energy from sunlight for photosynthesis.<\/li>\n  <li><p>Hot \u2013 Large concentrations of microbes thrive in Yellowstone National Park\u2019s Grand Prismatic Springs, a hot spring with water\n  temperatures up to 90oC (188oF). Other hot springs in Yellowstone are\n  extremely acidic, yet are home to many different kinds of bacteria and\n  microbes. Many of these microbes use chemical nutrients in the waters\n  and energy from sunlight for photosynthesis. Deep underground \u2013\n  Scientists have discovered bacteria living in ground- water 5\n  kilometers below the surface in deep gold mines of the Witwatersrand\n  Basin in South Africa. These microbes thrive in cavities and cracks in\n  rocks. Scientists are also are investigating life within and below\n  permafrost in north- ern Canada.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Bottom of the sea \u2013 Scientists have found abundant life clustered around hydro- thermal vents on the ocean floor, including bacteria,\n  mussels, clams, shrimp, and giant tubeworms that can reach ten feet in\n  length. Water pouring out of the vents in the complete darkness\n  thousands of feet under the surface of the sea can reach temperatures\n  of 113-120oC (235-248oF). The high pressures keep the water from\n  boiling. Bacteria use chemicals in the vent\u2019s water, primarily\n  hydrogen sulfide, as their energy source instead of sunlight. Other\n  creatures survive by eating the bacte- ria or each other.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li>High Acidity \u2013 The water in the Rio Tinto in southwestern Spain is very acidic, a result of chemical reactions between the water, and\n  iron and sulfur minerals in the ground. The river has a deep red\n  color, like wine, because of iron dissolved in the water. Microbes\n  living in the water use chemical reac- tions with iron and sulfur\n  minerals to generate the energy they need. Products from these\n  metabolic reactions contribute to the low pH in the environment. Many\n  algae and fungi also live in the acidic waters.<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as I know, there is no evidence of life in molten lava.

Lake Vostok\u2019s microbes elusive in first measurements of surface water<\/h1>\n  \n  <p>A first analysis of the ice that froze onto the drillbit used in last\n  February\u2019s landmark drilling to a pristine Antarctic lake shows no\n  native microbes came up with the lake water, according to Sergey Bulat\n  of Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (Russia). The very uppermost\n  layer of Lake Vostok appears to be \u201clifeless\u201d so far, says Bulat, but\n  that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of it is.   Bulat reported what he calls\n  his team\u2019s \u201cvery preliminary results\u201d on Tuesday, at the 12th European\n  Workshop on Astrobiology (ENEA 2012), in Stockholm, Sweden, at the\n  AlbaNova University Center. Bulat and his colleagues counted the\n  microbes present in the ice sample and checked their genetic makeup to\n  figure out the phylotypes. They counted fewer than 10 microbes/ml \u2014\n  about the same magnitude they would expect to find in the background\n  in their clean room. And three of the four phylotypes they identified\n  matched contaminants from the drilling oil, with the fourth unknown\n  but also most likely from the lubricant.   Bulat hopes to get clean\n  samples from the ice frozen in the borehole below where the drill bit\n  stopped. That won\u2019t be until next May (2013), if all goes well after\n  the next Russian drilling expedition in December-January. Even if the\n  top of the lake ends up being empty, Bulat suspects microbes will come\n  from lower water depths, or from sediment samples at the bottom of the\n  lake.   Lake Vostok is a stand-in for icy bodies that might harbor\n  life, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. Gerda Horneck of the German\n  Aerospace Center (DLR) said that any result from Lake Vostok is\n  important for astrobiology, and the search for extremophiles that\n  could give hints of what life could be like elsewhere. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\n  comes out next round,\u201d she told me at the end of the meeting on\n  Wednesday.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scoop.it/t/amazing-science/p/3031509753/sterile-lake-vostok-s-microbes-elusive-in-first-measurements-of-surface-water\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scoop.it/t/amazing-science/p/3031509753/sterile-lake-vostok-s-microbes-elusive-in-first-measurements-of-surface-water<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More info on Lake Vostok:<\/p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://earthsci.org/education/Lake_Vostok/vostok.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://earthsci.org/education/Lake_Vostok/vostok.html<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":5323,"question_id":5311,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1353863082}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5311/does-the-entire-surface-of-the-earth-contain-organisms","last_activity_date":1353863082,"creation_date":1353665959,"answer_count":3,"title":"Does the entire surface of the earth contain organisms?","body":"<p>Does the entire surface of the earth contain organisms?\nMy teacher mentioned that in some parts of the earth, there aren't any organism.

Depending on the type of conjugation you're using, the number of acceptor sites on the substrate, and the time and conditions of the conjugation reaction, you may be adding a highly variable number of conjugate molecules to your substrate.

If you haven't already, I'd suggest getting in touch with your conjugation kit vendor's tech support, as they likely encounter this problem all the time. You may need to change the type of conjugation chemistry, get a higher-quality conjugate, or purify the substrate before and/or after the reaction. One of the solutions to my antibody labeling problem I mentioned above was to purify the reaction products through a size-exclusion column.

Amongst these are the <em>Period<\/em> (<em>Per<\/em>) genes.<br>\n<em>Per<\/em> is then synthesised, and exported to the cytoplasm. Here, if in a sufficiently large amount, it can heterodimerize with the <em>Cryptocrome<\/em> (<em>Cry<\/em>) proteins: the dimer will then enter the nucleus and inhibit the transcription actions of the <em>Clock/Bmal<\/em> couple. This will in turn, block the transcription of <em>Per<\/em>, that will therefore not be able to dimerize with <em>Cry<\/em> and stop the inhibition of <em>Clock/Bmal<\/em> and so on. All of this takes approximately 24 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>This basic loop (and some more) is nicely schematised in this review by Reppert and Weaver<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12198538\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.<\/a> - Reppert and Weaver, <em>Nature.<\/em> <strong>2002<\/strong> Aug 29;418(6901):935-41.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xsvOj.jpg\" alt=\"Schematics of circadian clock - from Reppert and Weaver, Nature 2002\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I report here the legend of the figure:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The clock mechanism comprises interactive positive (green) and negative (red) feedback loops. CLOCK (C, oval) and BMAL1 (B, oval) form heterodimers and activate transcription of the Per, Cry and Rev-Erbalpha genes through E-box enhancers. As the levels of PER proteins increase (P, blue circle), they complex with CRY proteins (C, diamond) and CKI&epsilon;/CKI&delta; (&epsilon;/&delta;, circle), and are phosphorylated (p). In the nucleus, the CRY\u2013PER\u2013CKI&epsilon;/CKI&delta; complexes associate with CLOCK\u2013BMAL1 heterodimers to shut down transcription while the heterodimer remains bound to DNA, forming the negative feedback loop. For the positive feedback loop, increasing REV-ERB&alpha; levels (R, circle) act through Rev-Erb/ROR response elements in the Bmal1 promoter to repress (-) Bmal1 transcription. CRY-mediated inhibition of CLOCK\u2013BMAL1-mediated transcription de-represses (activates) Bmal1 transcription, because REV-ERB&alpha;-mediated repression is inhibited. An activator (A, circle) may positively regulate Bmal1 transcription (?) alone or by interacting with mPER2. There are probably kinases (?) other than CKI&epsilon; and CKI&delta; that participate in phosphorylation of clock proteins.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The clock machinery, however, is even more complex than this and different tissues need to integrate different signals (e.g. light, hormonal concentrations and so on).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, as nice as this may be, our bodies are not constituted by one single cell... if we \"zoom out\" a little bit and we go to the tissue or the whole body level, we see that circadian rhytms are present in all sorts of tissues and involve all sorts of different physiological processes. A very interesting question is then: how do cells from different organs coordinate each other so that the interrelation of different circadian processes is always the same? For instance, the release of cortisol peaks in the morning, our body temperature has a peak in the late afternoon and a trough in the early hours of the morning, and our heart rate is higher during the daytime.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1972, an article by Moore and Eichler was published, showing that lesioning the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (a region at the base of the brain) resulted in the \"breakage\" of the circadian rhythm of corticosterone (the stress hormone). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5047187\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loss of a circadian adrenal corticosterone rhythm following suprachiasmatic lesions in the rat.<\/a> - Moore and Eichler, <em>Brain Res.<\/em> <strong>1972<\/strong> Jul 13;42(1):201-6<\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that lesioning a bit of the brain resulted in loss of circadian rhythm in the adrenal gland was obviously a very big deal: the central circadian clock of the organism had been discovered.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will not going too much into that but, since 1972 many advances have been made and nowadays we know that, although the role of the SCN is very important, it is not the only clock in the body. Several peripheral clock exist, in organs such as the pituitary gland, the liver or the pancreas.

Pretty much water and selective ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca+2, etc.). Maybe a few other things, depending on how healthy you are.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, what does your body want to get <em>rid of<\/em> in your Urine? Well, anything it can't get rid of in your solid waste. That includes pretty much anything water soluble that could harm you, whether it's Urea, chelating agents for heavy metals, ions your body doesn't want (excess minerals), excess vitamins, sugars (to maintain insulin levels), hormones, liver byproducts, and whatever dark horrors mother nature is concocting for us in the forms of virii or whatever else.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's just the beginning of the list, but already you should start to see the impracticality of having active transport or coupled transport for everything. The list of transmembrane proteins needed to ferry <em>all<\/em> of the items your body wants to get rid of is <strong>a lot<\/strong> longer than the list of transmembrane proteins needed to keep what the body needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then you have the \"unknowns\" - whatever else your body hasn't encountered yet, but will still be water-soluble.

Given the relatively slow generation periods for humans, if a new compound turned out to be significantly fatal then the slow adaptation could spell disaster for any small populations and create serial bottlenecking events.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, while it may not be energetically favorable to let water and ions pass into the Nephron and subsequent tubules to be reclaimed, Evolutionarily speaking it's probably strongly selected for. We may expend a lot of energy reclaiming water against its concentration gradient, along with whatever else we want from Urine, but at the same time we get rid of everything else we don't <em>need<\/em> that's filtered through the glomerulus.

The mammalian kidney has a long evolutionary history and potentially a lot of phylogenetic inertia. Mammals do what they can with what they inherited from their ancestors.<\/p>\n\n<p>The metanephric kidney, which is what mammals have, is thought to have evolved with the first amniotes (terrestrial, cleidoic-egg-laying tetrapods). However, the metanephros, from when the definitive metanephric kidney evolved, was (is) present in most fishes as well as amphibians. These groups live all or part of their lives in fresh water, so their tissues are hyperosmotic relative to the water. Their problem is not retaining water, but getting rid of all the water that enters their tissues via osmosis. (Marine bony fish have small, aglomerular kidneys.)

Autopsy findings included cleft lip and palate; overlapping fingers; low-set ears; simian creases; hypoplastic external genitalia with undescended testes; Dandy-Walker malformation; slightly dilated lateral and third ventricles; hypoplasia of the cerebrum, pons, medulla, pituitary gland, thymus, lung, adrenal gland, and kidney; large ventricular septal defect; and enteric cyst behind the urinary bladder. The placenta was hypoplastic and showed no remarkable abnormalities, except for mild syncytial knots. Chromosome analyses of amniotic fluid cells at 31 weeks' gestation and the umbilical cord blood cells at delivery revealed a 92,XXYY karyotype. G-, C-, Q-, and N-banding heteromorphic studies demonstrated duplication of paternal chromosomes 1, 3, and 15, and maternal chromosome 22. In addition, the results of an analysis with 16 CA repeat polymorphic markers were consistent with duplicated inheritance of 1 paternal and 1 maternal haploid sets to the tetraploid patient.

One could argue that mice simply do not get diabetes the way people do. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are two causes of type 2 diabetes in the research world.  The first happens because the animal may have a genetic susceptibility and environmental conditions induce the disease (like most people).  The second happens because of mutations in one specific gene or another pretty much cause it to happen when the animal gets to a mature age (google term: mature onset diabetes in the young (MODY)).  MODY genes have not proven to be a great model for type 2 diabetes treatment in most people (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young\" rel=\"nofollow\">about 1% of diabetics have a MODY diabetes though<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Cats and dogs have been animals of interest as models of diabetes because their symptoms are human like and have shorter reproductive cycles.  <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/8/2072S.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some cats (like Burmese) clearly have a greater genetic predisposition to diabetes<\/a>, but cats who are obese, have high glycemic diets, or who get little or no physical activity are more likely to develop diabetes. <\/p>\n\n<p>As with humans, the condition leads to the insulin secreting cells of of the pancreas to slowly degrade and if these cells are gone, there is no recovery from type 2 diabetes.

The most important thing to do - common to all treatments - is to change the cat's diet - restrict calories if the cat is obese and change high glycemic food.  Additionally, insulin or drug treatments that reduce insulin resistance (such as are given to humans) can restart the islet cells that secrete insulin if the animal is lucky and don't always have to be lifetime prescriptions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reference I have does not give remission statistics, but it must work a reasonable amount of the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that cats are special.

They found that fertilisation was unaffected, but that preimplantation development of the embryo was affected by the mG environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>The introduction to the paper gives a good brief review of this area of research. Perhaps of particular relevance is this section:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the STS-80 space shuttle mission, mouse 2-cell embryos were collected on the ground, launched into space and cultured for four days in µG. The control embryos on Earth developed to normal blastocysts, but in the space flight group, none of the embryos showed any sign of development, and all degenerated (Schenker &amp; Forkheim, 1998) . A more reliable experiment was done on the Cosmos 1129 mission in 1979, when mature male and female rats were sent into orbit and then allowed to intermingle in a common breeding chamber (Serova &amp; Denisova, 1982). However, none of the females gave birth, although postflight examinations revealed that ovulation had occurred. Two of the females were reported to have achieved pregnancy, but the embryos appear to have been resorbed. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Schenker E, Forkheim K (1998) Mammalian mice embryo early development in weightlessness environment on STS 80 space flight.

Their reaction kinetics can be thought of as being a more random interaction, whereupon the enzyme comes into contact with a recognition site, then cleaves the DNA is and free to float around until the next reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA methylation comes in three common flavours: Dam (DNA adenine methylation), Dcm (DNA cytosine methylation) and CpG methylation. The addition of any of these methyl groups changes can interfere with enzyme recognition of the site. Many enzymes are partially or completely blocked by at least one kind of methylation, while other are completely uninhibited. This is due to the shape of the enzyme and of the DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now here is where I think you are conflating the two. <a href=\"http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">REbase<\/a> (Restriction Enzyme database) is indeed the authoritative list on restriction enzyme. You mention Dam cuts at GATC. The sequence GATC is the canonical adenine <em>methylation<\/em> (Dam) site. As you pointed out, no known restriction enzyme contains Dam. If we instead look up the recognition site, GATC will match with DpnI, a restriction enzyme that produced blunt ends. I think it is DpnI that you are speaking of, which preferentially cleaves Dam methylated DNA (hence why the recognition site GATC also matches Dam mythyltransferases). If the absense of methylated DNA (or if non-methylated DNA is more abundant), DpnI will also digest at GATC sites.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5236,"question_id":5234,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1352944257},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a11ba35d089eaa7eeb31a15a7b93240c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1661,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1661/dnaiel","reputation":160,"display_name":"Dnaiel","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":5239,"edited":false,"creation_date":1352998418,"comment_id":7472,"body":"couldn&#39;t ask for a better answer!  thanks so much."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1352973980,"creation_date":1352973980,"body":"<p><strong>Dam methyltransferase methylates large DNA molecules in a processive manner, with an effective range of up to 7 kb on either side of an initial methylation reaction.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>My answer is taken from this paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Urig, S. <em>et al<\/em>.

This means that after binding to the λ-DNA and starting the one-dimensional diffusion process, one MTase on average meets 3000 dam sites before it dissociates from the DNA. Since the enzyme performs a random walk, it will hit many sites more often than only once and the effective range of processivity corresponds to the square root of n<sub>av<\/sub>. Therefore, the dam MTase is able to methylate approximately 55 GATC sites on λ-DNA in a processive reaction in vitro. In this simulation, 4.6 associations of an MTase molecule to the same molecule of λ-DNA are required to obtain fully methylated DNA. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In a random DNA sequence GATC should occur on average every 4<sup>4<\/sup> = 256 residues.

(2012) Genomic analysis of a key innovation in an experimental Escherichia coli population. Nature 489:513-8. doi: 10.1038/nature11514<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Richard Lenski is conducting an experiment called the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) in which twelve populations of <em>E. coli<\/em> are grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium. This experiment has now been running for over 40,000 generations (>20 years). If we take a human generation as being 25 years, this is equivalent to one million years of <em>Homo<\/em> evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the diagnostic traits of the species <em>E. coli<\/em> is the inability to grow aerobically on citrate. The medium that is used in the LTEE does however contain citrate as a chelating agent (probably to solubilise ferric ions, although I haven't been able to confirm this). The Lenski group have recently reported on the appearance of a novel citrate-utilising mutant in one of the populations. The Cit<sup>+<\/sup> variant appeared at around 31000 generations, and became dominant after 33000 generations. Because the LTEE involves storing samples of each population every 500 generations it has been possible to analyse in detail the emergence of this new phenotypic trait, and indeed to replay it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The process that they describe has three phases:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Potentiation. This stage involved the appearance of mutations that were a necessary prerequisite for subsequent events. In this case it is thought that there were at least two potentiating mutations. These are as yet unidentified but their existence is inferred from replay experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Actualization. This is the emergence of the new trait, and in this case is the event that took place at 31,000 generations. This involved a tandem duplication event at the <em>citT<\/em> locus, bringing <em>citT<\/em> under control of a new promoter, belonging to the <em>rnk<\/em> gene. The citT protein is a citrate transporter that is only expressed under anaerobic conditions in wild-type <em>E. coli<\/em>. The gene duplication event led to the expression of the transporter under standard aerobic conditions, opening up the possibility of taking up citrate and metabolising it. Replay experiments indicate that this event originally conferred a very weak Cit<sup>+<\/sup> phenotype.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Refinement. This involves changes that strengthen the Cit<sup>+<\/sup> phenotype. In this case these seem to have been further gene duplications of the <em>rnk-citT<\/em> module (with up to eight copies in one replay experiment). This eventually stabilised with the presence of four copies.<\/p>\n\n<p>This may be the nearest that we can hope to get to defining a timeline of evolution of a new characteristic.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5228,"question_id":5219,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1352826879}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5219/is-there-a-timeline-for-the-frequency-of-evolution-of-any-species","last_activity_date":1352826879,"creation_date":1352748685,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is there a timeline for the frequency of evolution of any species?","body":"<p>Evolution is traditionally spoken of as an inherited change over generations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Does evolution happen one change at a time - or are there multiple changes occurring between two successive generations?

Still I wouldn't take this to mean we should stop doing systems biology research. <\/p>\n\n<p>At 18:30 brenner illustrates the inverse problem with some examples 1) can you create a drum from only the sounds that come from the drum? (no he says). 2) can you solve the molecular structure of a molecule from a diffraction problem (no he says).<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course we can do both of these, but the point is valid as we need to have an idea of what a drum looks like.  If we did have even a glance at a drum, this lets us build a model (cylinder of diameter d, height h and with a drum head of a tension t and material properties alpha beta, etc) from the sounds is a lot of work, but it could be done.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The problem of solving a molecular structure from diffraction intensities alone has also been solved for small molecules in the 60s I believe by so-called '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_methods_%28crystallography%29\">direct methods<\/a>' which don't work well or proteins and larger molecules.  Still the point is that you had to have a good mathematical model of molecules and diffraction to get to direct methods, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_isomorphous_replacement\">MIR<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-wavelength_anomalous_dispersion\">MAD<\/a> and other diffraction only methods. Sorry I can't go into details here...it might bore you to death if you don't care about crystallography. <\/p>\n\n<p>In both cases the statement is that you need to have that model - what does a molecule look like, what does an x-ray do when it encounters a crystal? In order to get there.  Which makes total sense and I agree with.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't read too much into this though, because in practice this <em>has<\/em> never been done, yet Bragg started with just the diffraction pattern and drew in models from other fields of study.  Given the nature of the proof described, no scientific discovery has ever happened in a mathematical vacuum and systems biology will not either. <\/p>\n\n<p>Rather I would read this talk as saying that the models we are using for action are not very good yet.  What is happening is that synthetic biology (engineering approaches), experimental observation, and intensive modeling (the 'inverse' and 'forward' approaches Brenner mentions) are all happening at once and are informing each other.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its hard to imagine that data from inverse approaches can't be an important part of any solution to biology.  Its also looking likelier that a mathematical model alone of biology will be difficult or impossible to find also.

It will be shown that systems biology attempts to solve inverse problems - that is, obtain models of biological systems from observations of their behaviour - whereas, what I call computational biology, continues in the classical mode of discovering the machinery of the system and computing behaviour, solving a forward problem.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Is Brenner simply wrong on this or is there something to his objections?<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the link to the actual talk that I refer to: <a href=\"http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/reading-the-human-genome-with-sydney-brenner/much-ado-about-nothing-systems-biology-and-inverse-problems\">http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/reading-the-human-genome-with-sydney-brenner/much-ado-about-nothing-systems-biology-and-inverse-problems<\/a><\/p>\n","question_id":5107,"tags":["systems-biology"],"score":11,"accepted_answer_id":5110,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":892,"up_vote_count":11},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9d8179ab349032dd789d29e085d2b65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1635,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1635/peter-i","reputation":38,"display_name":"Peter-i"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":7,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1352384624,"creation_date":1352384624,"body":"<p>There are metabolic processes in which ATP is synthesised without the involvement of ATP synthase.

They all seem to confirm the basic premise of the question: in tropical rain forests most of the minerals are held in the biomass and rapid decomposition contributes to the recycling of these nutrients for new growth. One example is <a href=\"http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/temprain.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tropical rainforests are noted for the rapid nutrient cycling that occurs on the ground.  In the tropics, leaves fall and decompose rapidly.  The roots of the trees are on the surface of the soil, and form a thick mat which absorbs the nutrients before they reach the soil (or before the rain can carry them away).  The presence of roots on the surface is a common phenomenon in all mature forests; trees that come along later in succession win out in competition for nutrients by placing their roots over top of the competitors, and this pattern is seen in the temperate rainforest as well.  What does not occur in the temperate rainforest, however, is a rapid cycling of nutrients.  Because of the cold conditions and the acidity released by decomposing coniferous needles on the forest floor, decomposition is much slower.  More of the nutrients are found in the soil here than would be the case in a tropical forest, although like the tropical forest most of the nutrients are held in the plants and animals themselves.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I looked for actual evidence of these differences in rates of decomposition and I found this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Salinas, N. <em>et al<\/em>.

Lactose is synthesized within lactating mammary glands from uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) and glucose by a transgalactosylation catalysed by a complex of β4-galactosyltransferase and α-lactalbumin (α-LA). α-LA is believed to have evolved from C-type lysozyme. Mammalian milk or colostrum usually contains a variety of oligosaccharides in addition to free lactose. Each oligosaccharide has a lactose unit at its reducing end; this unit acts as a precursor that is essential for its biosynthesis. It is generally believed that milk oligosaccharides act as prebiotics and also as receptor analogues that act as anti-infection factors. We propose the following hypothesis. The proto-lacteal secretions of the primitive mammary glands of the common ancestor of mammals contained fat and protein including lysozyme, but no lactose or oligosaccharides because of the absence of α-LA. When α-LA first appeared as a result of its evolution from lysozyme, its content within the lactating mammary glands was low and lactose was therefore synthesized at a slow rate. Because of the presence of glycosyltransferases, almost all of the nascent lactose was utilized for the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides. The predominant saccharides in the proto-lacteal secretions or primitive milk produced by this common ancestor were therefore oligosaccharides rather than free lactose. Subsequent to this initial period, the oligosaccharides began to serve as anti-infection factors. They were then recruited as a significant energy source for the neonate, which was achieved by an increase in the synthesis of α-LA. This produced a concomitant increase in the concentration of lactose in the milk, and lactose therefore became an important energy source for most eutherians, whereas oligosaccharides continued to serve mainly as anti-microbial agents. Lactose, in addition, began to act as an osmoregulatory molecule, controlling the milk volume. Studies on the chemical structures of the milk oligosaccharides of a variety of mammalian species suggest that human milk or colostrum is unique in that oligosaccharides containing lacto-N-biose I (LNB) (Gal(β1 → 3)GlcNAc, type I) predominate over those containing N-acetyllactosamine (Gal(β1 → 4)GlcNAc, type II), whereas in other species only type II oligosaccharides are found or else they predominate over type I oligosaccharides. It can be hypothesized that this feature may have a selective advantage in that it may promote the growth of beneficial colonic bacteria, Bifidobacteria, in the human infant colon.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":5113,"question_id":5104,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5104/what-selective-factors-drove-the-evolution-of-lactose-in-lactation","last_activity_date":1351963095,"creation_date":1351929611,"answer_count":1,"title":"What selective factors drove the evolution of lactose in lactation?","body":"<p>As far as I can determine, lactose, and the monosaccharide galactose have few biological uses outside of mammalian lactation.

See tables 2/3 in the cited review.<\/p>\n\n<p>It appears the molecular mechanism of <strong>veisalgia<\/strong> (HA, a new word) is not well known.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. acetaldehyde<\/strong> Part of it may be attributed to acetaldehyde but there is clearly more to it. The liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) produces acetaldehyde from ethanol, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) makes acetate from that, so the aldehyde does not exist for a long time, and is rather responsible for short-term illnesses.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. ADH and diuresis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hangover severity is proportional to antidiuretic hormone\n  concentration (46). Alcohol inhibits the effect of antidiuretic\n  hormone on the kidneys, thereby inducing  diuresis that is out of\n  proportion to the volume of fluid ingested. As blood alcohol\n  concentration decreases and dehydration persists, the serum level of\n  antidiuretic hormone increases, maintaining water retention in\n  dehydrated patients with hangover. In our clinical experience,\n  hydration attenuates but does not completely relieve hangover\n  symptoms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3. cytokines<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The constellation of hangover symptoms (nausea, headache, diarrhea)\n  resembles that seen in conditions related to dysregulated cytokine\n  pathways (for example, in viral infections and after administration of\n  interferon-alpha). Alcohol alters cytokine production through a\n  thromboxane pathway. Levels of thromboxane B2 are elevated during\n  experimentally induced alcohol hangover (42), and the administration\n  of tolfenamic acid, a prostaglandin inhibitor, at the time of alcohol\n  consumption has a small prophylactic effect in reducing hangover\n  severity (9).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>4. further substances<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Congeners, the byproducts of individual alcohol preparations (which\n  are found primarily in brandy, wine, tequila, whiskey, and other dark\n  liquors), increase the frequency and severity of hangover (24, 39,\n  40). Clear liquors, such as rum, vodka, and gin, tend to cause\n  hangover less frequently.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So there are factors that aren't even identified exactly, and these could fit the mixing of drinks observation.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are several reviews out there, just search for hangover at Google Scholar.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wiese, Jeffrey G., Michael G.

Systematic process (migration, mutation, selection) affect gene frequencies in an often quite predictable manner and strength. Dispersive process (Random drift, differentiation between sub-populations, uniformity within sub-populations, increased homozygosity) are random in their direction and only predictable in their amount. Your question focusses on the systematic process called selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a large population (if we ignore dispersive processes for the time being) the gene frequencies will reach an equilibrium called Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This means, with constant rates of the systematic processes, each locus will reach a point of stable equilibrium. Mutation and migration bringing more variation, and selection reduces it (over simplified - sometimes selection maintains variation, see my answer about why variation exists <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/932/why-does-so-much-variation-exist-within-species/5079#5079\">here<\/a>). The frequency of each allele at equilibrium will be where these effects balance out. If selection becomes weaker against one allele it will become more frequent in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>By using medicine etc. to cure diseases we reduce the selection acting on a deleterious mutation thereby putting the gene frequencies in to a state of flux during which they move to new equilibrium points. So in short the answer is yes, modern medicine is decreasing our genetic fitness by allowing deleterious mutations to become more common.<\/p>\n\n<p>I raise the question, will we ever be able to cure all genetically caused disease? In my reckoning, no, at least certainly not in our lifetimes.<\/p>\n\n<p>It only represents a real risk if we suddenly are unable to cure diseases.

You are talking about phenotypes (eye colour) or in the case of acne, not a trait at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll answer the question I think you're asking: <strong>why does biological variation exist?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Variation is constantly being generated by mutation, errors in the replication of the genome of an individual. If a mutation occurs in the gametic cells, it affects the genotype of the offspring. By affecting the genotype, it may or may not have a discernable effect on the phenotype. Where a gametic mutation isn't fatal, it has a chance of becoming established in the population when that mutant individual breeds. That chance is increased the further along the gradient from harmful to beneficial that effect of that mutation is.<\/p>\n\n<p>Variation also exists because development responds to environmental factors, not just genetics. Different individuals grow in different environments, and have unique combinations of factors influencing many traits.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason variation persists is because, except under conditions of extreme selective pressure or genetic bottlenecks, many traits have no impact on survival or fecundity (reproductive success) or are determined only partly by genetics. Height, for example, only has a very slight impact on fecundity within quite a broad range of heights. It is partly genetically determined, and partly determined by environmental factors such as diet (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16140897\">Eckhardt et al. 2005<\/a>), exposure to toxins during development, muscular development etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>If height were the key factor in human mate selection, we might see a gradual reduction in the range of heights, and a gradual increase in average height. However, what we see in reality is that height has changed through human history in concordance with economic factors like social status, inflation and war (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w8542\">Steckel, 2001<\/a>), suggesting that nutrition is a major determinant.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know it wasn't your choice of example, but for more detail on the effects of natural selection on human height, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/457/height-and-natural-selection-in-humans\">see this question<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":933,"question_id":932,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1328544889},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b54db305c112fa204ce59f9ca3d50c33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":634,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/634/julianaa","reputation":253,"display_name":"JulianaA"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1332055490,"creation_date":1332055490,"body":"<p>It sounds like you're also trying to ask the question, \"how can non-adaptive or maladaptive traits evolve?\" and that you're not necessarily interested in acne specifically.

To cut to the short answer skip to the <strong>bold<\/strong> summary at the bottom...<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, genetic variation <strong>exists<\/strong> because of mutation. Genes get mutated every generation, the . Larger populations will have more mutants within them because: more individuals = more nucleotide base pairs (C's G's A's and T's) = more potential sites of mutation. However mutation is not likely to explain the <strong>persistence<\/strong> of variation because mutation rates are very low (1 in 100,000 to 1,000,000 gametes have a newly mutated loci at any individual locus) and singleton alleles have only a 50% chance of reproduction (assuming no selection) so are likely to be lost by drift (Falconer &amp; Mackay, Intro to Quantitative Genetics 1996).<\/p>\n\n<p>You also talk about acne, which is likely to have a large component of environmental variance. Therefore you should remember that not all phenotypic variance is genetic its source and it is  highly likely that an individual trait has some degree of environmental variance component. Simplistically:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Phenotypic variance = genotypic variance + environmental variance<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So the bigger question is <strong>why does variation persist?<\/strong> There are many potential causes of this which continue to be widely debated. Essentially it seems paradoxical because selection should reduce variation as it drives the fixation of all loci to the fittest allele. However, selection is transient, both spatially and temporally, and is not efficient against rare alleles (especially recessive alleles because they are hidden by dominant traits - e.g. disease \"carriers\"). Another important point is that some mutations will be neutral, therefore remain unaffected by selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the spatial context, this means that selection is not always favouring the same allele in all places a species inhabits. Selection might be different based on the where it is occurring (within a species, traits like fur would be beneficial to populations in cold climates but not to those in warmer climates - here I am assuming that the sole effect of fur is to improve the ability of retaining heat).<\/p>\n\n<p>Temporally there are also key elements. Principally, over time selection changes. Again sticking with my fur example, climates change. Ice ages come and go bringing with them different selection coefficients for fur growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another variance in selection can be sexually antagonistic selection, where different alleles are favoured in either sex. In this case selection does not deplete variation but instead maintains it. It has recently been shown that sexual antagonism is prevalent throughout the genome.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the divergent reproductive strategies of the sexes could promote the\n  maintenance of sexually-antagonistic variation (Sharp &amp; Agrawal 2012... yesterday!)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Other hypotheses suggest mechanisms by with selection can maintain variation such as assortative mating.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Long story short, you stated that you expect variation to reduce as a consequence of selection. However genetic variation persists for many reasons, and can even be maintained by selection in several ways. Furthermore, phenotypic variation which is what you actually describe with your acne example (and I with my fur example) can be caused by non-genetic components of variation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested reading:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cox &amp; Calsbeek 2009, Sexually Antagonistic Selection, Sexual Dimorphism, and the\nResolution of Intralocus Sexual Conflict.<\/p>\n\n<p>Falconer &amp; Mackay 1996, Introduction to Quantitative Genetics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Singh &amp; Krimbas 2000, Evolutionary Genetics: from molecules to morphology.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sharp &amp; Agrawal 2012 (in press, accepted on-line version released yesterday, print may be 2013) Male-biased fitness effects of spontaneous mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, Evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Innocenti &amp; Morrow 2011, The Sexually Antagonistic Genes of Drosophila melanogaster, PLoS Biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arnqvist 2011 Assortative mating by fitness and sexually antagonistic genetic variation, Evolution.

Secondly, please excuse the lack of thorough sourcing for this post. I only like to share some pointers...<\/p>\n\n<p>Q: <strong>Can substances do more harm in a mammal at a lower dose than at higher dose?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A: <strong>Yes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Some may know the example of the blood thinner, and widespread NSAID Acetyl-salicylic acid (Aspirin). I will use this example because Aspirin is one of the most known and used drugs in the world, with a long and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aspirin\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting history<\/a>. As being part of the class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) it has recently gotten a bad wrap for blocking an enzyme which is crucial for prostaglandin synthesis and processes that maintain  a healthy stomach wall in the presence of an potentially harmful <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori#Pathophysiology\" rel=\"nofollow\">bacterial<\/a> and chemical milieu. On a sidenote, as an acid, Aspirin actually hardly dissolves directly in the acidic stomach.<\/p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin#Pharmacokinetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a> (DOR: 28/09/2012):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid\n  (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl\n  glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (&lt; 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic\n  acid.[148] When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are\n  ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an\n  elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.[149][150] When higher\n  doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life\n  becomes much longer (15\u201330 hours),[151] because the biotransformation\n  pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl\n  phenolic glucuronide become saturated<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Aspirin can <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/aspirin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">interfere with a lot of drugs<\/a>, including <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12533193\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ibuprofen<\/a>. The known list of drugs is so high, in part due to the widespread application of aspirin, and in part due to the chemical composition of this very small drug with two functional groups. A functional group is a sort of chemical feature that determines how and with what probability a chemical interacts in a given milieu.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a certain metabolic degradation pathway may get saturated, other pathways can take over and lead to different potentially harmful metabolites resulting in damage to the excretion/clearance organs such as the liver (<code>hepatotoxic<\/code>) and kidney (<code>nephrotoxic<\/code>).\nA <code>metabolite<\/code> is the product of metabolism ( a weak back-referencing definition). <code>metabolic pathways<\/code> are a sequence of chemical reactions within a cell, and metabolism is the entire set of metabolites and pathways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Liver/Kidney Toxicity is believed to result from an interplay of a) high concentrations of metabolites or direct toxins (=parent chemicals) within specialized high-concentration-forming cells, and b)  the non/covalent  binding of cellular macromolecules to interfere with their normal function and/or production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another example (from memory) is the interaction pharmacokinetics of theobromine (from cacao) and other xanthines (unverified).<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many more examples. I hope this example and mechanism serves you well as a starting point...<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From a biochemical standpoint:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In fact drugs may act differently at different concentration thresholds at different times at different places within an organism and its cells that make it up. Evolution exploited this very early on and used it for things like body segmentation along defined axis during development.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Drugs may interact with each other differently at different levels of concentrations, say as binary, ternary, and higher order complexes. The rate of formation of such complexes is denoted through the dissociation constant - which is a type of equilibrium constant such as pH is.<\/p>\n\n<p>The dissociation constant describes the propensity of a chemical species to separate reversibly and, - this is crucial! - is concentration dependent. This is accounted for by the use of so called <code>activities<\/code> or the apparent concentrations, as a result of incomplete hydration of the chemical and other effects of a \"crowded environment\". Now don't just think of chemicals, but macromolecules as well. In immunology for instance new molecular features can arise on the surface of a macromolecule, due to the association (complexation) with a small molecular drug. This in turn can lead to an immunological reaction, even anaphylaxis ( a so called Type I hypersensitivity reaction) and ultimately shock. Such drugs are classified as <code>haptens<\/code>.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Important in an organisms sensitivity and susceptibility to drugs however, is the current <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry\" rel=\"nofollow\">allometric growth rate<\/a> and types of organs and cells available. As such a fetus is more susceptible than an adult.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope a simple <strong>yes<\/strong> accompanied by this admittedly <em>to-long to really read<\/em> post gave you some insight into what scientist across many, many fields are dealing with. Naturally, the issue is more complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally I believe the issue of dosing and drug reactions will improve significantly over the coming decade...<\/p>\n","answer_id":3712,"question_id":3711,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1348898883},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef067cf09ffd3cc8f069bacec73c8202?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":222,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/222/david-lebauer","reputation":780,"display_name":"David LeBauer","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":3729,"edited":false,"creation_date":1349028595,"comment_id":5660,"body":"Example of something always reactive no matter the dose?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":166,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/166/konrad-rudolph","reputation":3847,"display_name":"Konrad Rudolph"},"score":0,"post_id":3729,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef067cf09ffd3cc8f069bacec73c8202?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":222,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/222/david-lebauer","reputation":780,"display_name":"David LeBauer","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1349032532,"comment_id":5663,"body":"@David No, sorry. \u201cno matter the dose\u201d is also stretching it a bit \u2013 you always need some minimal amount, it\u2019s just that the steepness of the curve varies."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef067cf09ffd3cc8f069bacec73c8202?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":222,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/222/david-lebauer","reputation":780,"display_name":"David LeBauer","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":3729,"edited":false,"creation_date":1349037947,"comment_id":5666,"body":"thanks for the clarification; as written it can be interpreted as &quot;homeopathy&quot; doesn&#39;t work, except when it does.
