To skip ahead to the conclusion: I'm going to recommend that you read up about linkage disequilibrium. Everything else is background information that will hopefully help you understand why linkage disequilibrium is what I think you're looking for.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background: Meiosis Basics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, in the bare principle, meiosis is quite simple. Let's consider meiosis in a human cell, i.e. the division of a primary spermatocyte (the only other example is division of primary oocytes). That's this one we're talking about: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_28_01_04.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_28_01_04.jpg<\/a> In simple terms, the ready-to-develop primary spermatocyte contains 46 chromosomes, two (2n) each of chromosomes 1-22, an X and a Y chromosome. Two chromosomes of the same type (e.g. \"chromosome 4\") are called homologues. Homologues contain different versions (= alleles) of the same genes. During Meiosis I, homologues align in pairs, recombine, and then separate into two new cells (which are now 1n). The following Meiosis II is basically a mitosis, meaning that the two (identical apart from previous recombinations) chromatids of the chromosomes are separated and packaged into separate cells.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Recombination and Interstices<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>During the alignment of homologues in Meiosis I, the attraction between the two chromosomes depends on their homology - i.e. similarities in DNA sequences that end up being close to each other in this setting. This attraction is on the molecular level, so the tightly-condensed neighbouring DNA double-helices actually physically stick to each other because the polarities/charges across relatively large stretches of the molecules complement each other. I don't think how this exactly works is well understood yet, but what is clear is that homologues attract each other at this point because they contain mostly the same DNA sequence, apart from small differences (which make the different alleles).<\/p>\n\n<p>How exactly recombination occurs at this point isn't entirely clear either on the molecular level (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination#In_eukaryotes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination#In_eukaryotes<\/a>). Just to get an idea of how it could work: while the two chromosomes are aligned, it's not difficult for them to actually tangle up and break, leaving the repair machinery with the potential to fuse the wrong chromosome ends together. The breaking and exchange might also be a programmed process with dedicated cell machinery (quite probably so I think personally).<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, <strong>not all locations are equally likely to recombine<\/strong>. It depends on levels of homology (i.e. \"stickiness\") between individual stretches of DNA and other unknown factors. Just in the same way, the number of break points in each chromosome isn't pre-determined.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mendelian Inheritance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, the concept of loci is arbitrary and has no molecular basis. A locus is simply \"a place on a chromosome\" and could refer to an individual base(-pair) or a whole stretch of DNA. The concept is however useful when talking about inheritance, as it illustrates the principle of <em>linkage<\/em>, or rather <strong>linkage disequlibrium<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I am aware, it comes from a time before we began thinking in chromosomes. One could study whether there was linkage between two traits (or more generally loci), i.e. a higher-than-random chance to inherit the two together. We now know that linkage simply means that the two loci are on the same chromosome (for example, chromosome 6). Thus, if no linkage exists, the chance to inherit both loci together is no larger than expected by random Mendelian inheritance (which makes sense as there is no molecular mechanism that makes offspring e.g. more likely than 50/50 to inherit chromosome 6 and 19 together from the same parent).

The level of glutamate released from a photoreceptor then changes the membrane potential of the other neurons in the retina connected to the photoreceptor (<em>bipolar cells<\/em>, for instance). Signals are processed within the retina, then passed through <em>retinal ganglion cells<\/em> (RGCs), along the optic nerve, through sub-cortical structures and in to visual cortex.<\/p>\n\n<p>This process occurs continuously, but all of the elements along the way have intrinsic time constants and other temporal constraints (number of photons required for opsin activation; recovery rate of the opsins in the photoreceptors; membrane time constants and refractory periods of neurons; synaptic delays; etc.). Persistence of vision (the effect underlying the perception of a movie as a continuous stream rather than a series of distinct frames) probably relies on the conjunction of many of these time constants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concretely, a flashed visual stimulus produces a response in (primate) visual cortex after around 30\u201350 ms (<a href=\"http://maunsell.med.harvard.edu/Downloads/publications/92bMaunsell.pdf\">Maunsell and Gibson 1992<\/a>).

When a + sign is shown, the locus contains the natural, fully working gene (wild type). When a - is shown, it means that by natural mutation or lab manipulation, cells lack that natural gene, or make a negligible amount of it, or make a broken variant etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>These cells are diplod, meaning they have two homologous chromosomes. If +/+ is shown, both chromosomes carry, in that locus, a working gene. If -/- is shown, both copies are not working. If a cell is CatL -/-, both its natural copies of CatL are missing or defective, and the cell is unable to make the corresponding protein. The manipulation through which a naturally occurring +/+ is turned into a defective -/- is called a knock out. <\/p>\n\n<p>The top part of your chart shows what is happening in the nucleus, on the chromosomes, at the actual places where normal cells store their CatL genes. You don't give much detail, but the bottom of the chart appears to show some manipulation away from the normal locus. There are ways to introduce more copies, to stick them into the nucleus, or even in chromosomes etc, but the main point about introducing DNA is that often it will not work as well as the natural thing. <\/p>\n\n<p>Optimal infection means something close to the first column, about 25%.

The relation is more sophisticated than that. For example heart rate is controlled by nerves and hormones, and neither comes straight from the lung. But fast breathing leads to changes in blood oxygen and pH, which are picked up by sensors such as the carotid body, which informs the medulla, which then talks to the sinoatrial node. There is also more direct influence, because ample breathing increases pressure in the thorax.<\/p>\n\n<p>But at each step, there are many other factors interfering, meaning the correlation between the two gets ever looser. There isn't really a \"normal\" ratio of heart rate to respiration rate. There is a healthy heart rate and a healthy respiratory rate, but they are both wide intervals (60-100 and 12-20, respectively). Dividing one by the other, you get a very wide interval, from 60 beats per minute / 20 breaths per minute = <strong>3<\/strong>, to 100 beats per minute / 12 breaths per minute = <strong>8<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps in practice the most common values for beats per breath are in a narrower interval.

The phage ejects about 850 bp of the 40 kb genome into the host; the entry of the bulk of the DNA is coupled to transcription, first by host  RNA polymerase, and subsequently by the phage-specific RNA polymerase, once the corresponding gene has entered the cell. If the drug rifampin is used to block transcription then the whole process stalls. This block is overcome if the initial leader of 850 bp is engineered to contain a recognition sequence for EcoK1 whereupon the restriction enzyme is able to translocate the entire genome into the cell at 100 - 200 bp per second.

This makes the overall potential also positive.   <\/p>\n\n<p>If you want further clarifications regarding the calculation of the equilibrium and the nernst potential across the membrane, feel free to ask.   <\/p>\n\n<p>ADDENDUM  <\/p>\n\n<p>The approximate concentrations of sodium and potassium inside and outside a cell are :-<br>\n$$\\ce {Na+_{in}}=10 \\text{mmoll}^{-1}$$\n$$\\ce {K+_{in}}=105 \\text{mmoll}^{-1}$$\n$$\\ce {Na+_{out}}=140 \\text{mmoll}^{-1}$$\n$$\\ce {K+_{out}}=5 \\text{mmoll}^{-1}$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>The Nernst potential is given by $E=-\\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln\\frac{\\text{in}}{\\text{out}}$  <\/p>\n\n<p>Which for the given concentrations comes out to be $+67.7mV$ for sodium and $-78.1mV$ for potassium.

Using the <a href=\"http://www.nernstgoldman.physiology.arizona.edu/launch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GHK equation<\/a>(ignoring the contribution of chlorine) gives us a net potential of $+47.5mV$.<\/p>\n\n<p>The graph of the action potential clearly indicates that at the peak of the AP, the membrane potential is positive.

Cell cytoplasms are negatively charged (to remember this, it helps to remember that protons are usually pumped out of the cytosol either into the periplasm, vesicles, mitochondrial intermemberane space, or outside of the cell). If you subtract the potential of the outside from the inside, you'll get +70. If you do it the other way around, you'll get -70. By convention, the (+) probe of the voltmeter is stuck inside the cell, and the (-) is stuck outside, so we end up with the \"official\" figure of -70 mV.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nature obviously does not like this potential difference, and wants to neutralize it by pushing current across the membrane. Luckily the membrane is not very conductive, and the cell can expend energy to undo the effects of any leaking and prevent the potential [difference] from drifting toward 0 (it would actually drift toward a number above 0 because potential difference isn't the only factor, there is also the concentration difference).<\/p>\n\n<p>So the cell is like a battery that keeps itself charged. It also has a threshold, and it will only empty itself if it has discharged at least to a certain point. That point depends on the cell, but a typical value is -55 mV (so closer to equilibrium point than the resting -70 mV).<\/p>\n\n<p>What will an inhibitory chemical like GABA do? It will pull the cell further away from the threshold, so it's harder to overcome it. Bringing -70 mV to -90 mV would be lowering it (because the number goes down).<\/p>\n\n<p>What will an excitatory chemical like glutamate do? It will bring the cell closer to the threshold, so it's easier to overcome it. Bringing -70 mV to -55 mV would be raising it (because the number goes up).<\/p>\n\n<p>The question, unfortunately, does not specify whether the action potential fires. Typically, the peak of the AP is +40 mV. In theory, you could have a threshold say, at +20 mV, and then perhaps the potential could go positive (eg. +10 mv) and stay there. But I really, really doubt you could find a cell with a threshold above 0. If the threshold is below zero, then the cell <em>will<\/em> reach a positive potential difference (if you use enough glutamate to elicit the AP), but it will only stay there momentarily before collapsing back to -80 mV (the refractory state).<\/p>\n","answer_id":17474,"question_id":17361,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f59f7acf0f314aa32ca7c03950e9e6f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":587,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/587/chelonian","reputation":253,"display_name":"Chelonian"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93ad97cd6d264067b56ee1e08fa0b73d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/540/superbest","reputation":2283,"display_name":"Superbest","accept_rate":69},"score":1,"post_id":20687,"edited":false,"creation_date":1408755654,"comment_id":32311,"body":"I suspect that you are over-thinking this likely undergraduate-level question: 3 of your answers are &quot;maybe&quot; and one is &quot;none&quot;; you are unable to execute the prompt of the question (&quot;choose the correct one&quot; whilst there is not a single statement that you think is correct).

Since the human genome is a little over 3 billion bases long, a 20 base sequence should appear only once. However, most of an individual's DNA isn't random, it's inherited from their parents, and they got their's from their parents, etc. Long story short, there isn't a lot of unique DNA in any given person. The uniqueness is only visible on the large scale, you have half of your DNA from your father, and half from your mother. So would any of your siblings, but the specific DNA they got from each parent would be different from yours.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think we can calculate the odds of getting a specific set of chromosomes from a parent. If there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, then the probability of getting any given set should be $\\frac{1}{2^{23}}$, since we have 2 parents, the odds of getting your specific set of DNA is $(\\frac{1}{2^{23}})^2$, which is about 1 in 70 trillion. So the odds of you having a non-identical twin that has the same DNA as you is very low. But any given 20 base sequence should have a 50% probability of appearing in you and the sibling.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if we look at 2 20 base sequences of DNA in you and your sibling, and each had a 50% chance of appearing, then the probability of both sequences appearing in the both of you is 25%. If we add a third, it goes to 12.5%, and so on. If there are 7 billion humans on earth, we need a probability of less than 1 in 7 billion, and $2^{33}$ is about 8.6 billion, so if you looked at 33 different sites on the genome it should be able to differentiate you from every human on the planet<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, did I do the math right?

Burning for example, a large burn can be very life threatening biologically but small burns are not as harmful comparatively. But the psychological harm they would cause is phenomenal. This is because large burns open up the body to infections, dehydration and a lot of other harm. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let's take stabbing as another cause of pain. One stab in a less dangerous place missing all important structures may be not that harmful but may be painful. However multiple small stabs into important structures like arteries or spinal cord could be horribly destructive. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then let's look at headaches or nerve pain. Here it is only the pain and usually there isn't any destructive or harmful process. Most individuals would take one really, really bad headache followed by never having a headache then chronic daily \"tension\" headaches. \nPsychologically though usually the chronic daily pain is the worst. Particularly as without adequate pain management from the start, it is less responsive to painkillers (analgesia). It frequently adds to depression if it does not cause it itself and can lead to suicide. Also painkillers themselves may cause chronic pain which does not help. <\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, acute severe pain suggests something is seriously wrong and needs to be dealt with immediately biologically as there is likely a damaging process underlying it. However if this event is survived, it may be linked with high disability from any biological process that underpinned the pain. Chronic daily pain suggests a long continuing process. The cause of this may be life threatening, such as cancers, but is usually less dangerous at least compared to acute severe pain biologically. However the psychological aspects of this pain are seriously important as they can be particularly detrimental. <\/p>\n","answer_id":20658,"question_id":20648,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20648/is-severe-but-short-term-pain-worse-than-moderate-but-prolonged-pain-for-the-bod","last_activity_date":1408631122,"creation_date":1408568401,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is severe but short-term pain worse than moderate but prolonged pain for the body?","body":"<p>I'm wondering about the effects of different durations and intensities of pain on the body. So the two can be compared, let's say that the cause of pain is the same in both cases, but in one the duration is shorter although the pain is more severe, and vice versa. Also, by effects, I mean biological but also psychological (which is probably more interesting), but the latter might be out of the scope of this site, so forgive me if it is.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For the sake of a (rather grim) example, if someone is exposed to a painful stimulus such as a mid-voltage shock for a long duration, and if someone else is exposed to a much higher voltage shock for a much shorter duration of time, which would produce worse effects on the body's normal functioning? (Somewhat morbidly, I should say to assume that they both live and do not die on the spot.) Since the answer very well might depend on the type of harmful stimulus, I'll give another example of a burn. If one is repeatedly subjected to a first-degree burn for a while and another is subjected to a third-degree burn only once, which is worse?  <\/p>\n\n<p>Upon pondering the question, it seems that the psychological effects would be more interesting since they should be roughly the same regardless of the type of stimulus, but biologically the effects obviously differ.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time, and any responses or thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong> Obviously most experiments to test this would be subjective and unethical, especially in the case of psychological effects, so just an opinion from someone more knowledgeable in biology is more than fine.<\/p>\n","question_id":20648,"tags":["neuroscience","brain","pain"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":20658,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13618f9c0719b7e0c821f4f6ec597cb6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8797,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8797/user931392","reputation":13,"display_name":"user931392"},"closed_date":1408370089,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":20561,"edited":false,"creation_date":1408259871,"comment_id":31973,"body":"Can you please work on your question?

For example, you might want to determine whether the difference in the mean gene expression level between treated and untreated cells is different, or if the gene expression level of cells in a certain environment differs from what you would expect in a null hypothesis. <strong>Assumptions:<\/strong> You are assuming that the populations you are looking at are normally distributed. The variance of the populations is not known (that would be a Z-test), but it is assumed that the variance of each population is the same. Finally, for the t-test to work, the samples of the data from the two populations are assumed to be independent.<\/li>\n<li>$\\chi^2$ test: Several possibilities for this. The most common in biology is the Pearson $\\chi^2$ test, which is used when you are looking at <em>categorical data<\/em>, like the number of pea plants with white or purple flowers and round or wrinkled seeds, and trying to see whether the number of individuals in each category is consistent with some null hypothesis (such as the number in each category you'd expect if the genes for flower color and seed shape are not linked). <strong>Assumptions:<\/strong> The data points were randomly and independently gathered from the population, and you have a reasonably large number of samples.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I'd hate to have made a huge mistake, so please edit my answer and/or contribute your own if you think I am completely misrepresenting these topics!<\/p>\n","answer_id":13491,"question_id":13486,"up_vote_count":11},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1384617161,"creation_date":1384497769,"body":"<p><strong>Additional Info<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong>T-test<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As A.Kennard said t-test is applied when the random variable is normally distributed. How to know what is normally distributed is a relevant question. Regular measures which suffer some random error of measurement are normally distributed. The mean values estimated from different samples (the experiment that generates that sample may have <strong>any<\/strong> distribution) follow normal distribution. For e.g mean time interval of a radioactive decay- the interval itself is exponentially distributed but the mean of the mean decay interval will be normally distributed. You can reason that it is again an error of measurement that leads to variation in the mean value calculated in different samples. This is called the <em>central limit theorem<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>A normal distribution has two parameters- mean and variance i.e. you need to know these values beforehand to construct a normal distribution. A uniform distribution has no parameters- that doesn't mean that uniformly distributed samples have no mean or variance (in this case mean and variance are sample properties not distribution parameters).\nA t-test or z-test is done to see if a sample is a representative of a given normal distribution. That again means that the calculated mean and variance are equivalent to the corresponding distribution parameters. In case of z-test you know the population variance (distribution parameter). You may ask how can anyone possibly know the population variance beforehand. An example is a case in which you already know the error rate of your measuring device (may be provided by the manufacturer or interpreted from its design).<\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong>$\\chi^2$ test<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are several variants of the $\\chi^2$ test. But what is common between them is that they refer to <strong>$\\chi^2$ distribution<\/strong>. Variances, which are always positive cannot be a normally distributed. These follow $\\chi^2$ distribution. The F-test for variances uses the ratio of the $\\chi^2$ statistic of the two random variables denoting variances. Even in the Pearson $\\chi^2$ test, the test statistic is a sum of squares which makes it always positive. \nIn fact this $\\chi^2$ distribution is also used in t-test. As . Kennard said, one of the assumptions of t-test is that the population variance is unknown but assumed to be equal. Since population variance is unknown it has to be estimated from the sample. Like the case with all estimates you dont have a fixed value but a range of acceptable values falling in some confidence intervals. T-distribution is basically an average of several normal distributions with variance values falling in the allowed confidence interval of a $\\chi^2$ distribution. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is not necessary that categorical data are to be tested by $\\chi^2$ test. Coin toss experiment gives rise to a categorical but it can be tested against a binomial distribution. So $\\chi^2$ test can be used for categorical data but it is not the only test. <\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong><code>Bottomline<\/code><\/em><\/strong>: a statistic tested by a $\\chi^2$ test has $\\chi^2$ <strong>distribution<\/strong> as its sampling distribution. That statistic should be a square/sum of squares- something that can never possibly have a negative value. Perhaps that is why it is called $\\chi$ <strong><em>squared<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13497,"question_id":13486,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1384617161},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac1ec4017b16e98861a27e6c0d5c8e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8826,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8826/sachin01663","reputation":7,"display_name":"sachin01663"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":0,"post_id":20615,"edited":false,"creation_date":1408532330,"comment_id":32112,"body":"No, you can&#39;t compare just two numbers (.23 vs. .01) with a t-test."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVigb.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13338,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13338/eli-korvigo","reputation":548,"display_name":"Eli Korvigo","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":20615,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1450356872,"comment_id":70625,"body":"@kmm He could&#39;ve collected a series of results to test.

Apart from the fact that <strong>sharp kinks would cause a massive and useless loss of kinetic energy<\/strong> on blood flow from shear stress over the aortic walls (and therefore more heart workload), the induced <strong>shear stress would also damage the aortic walls<\/strong> much more quickly than in the actual configuration.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The third reason is just theory on my part, but it seems the vascular system is designed by priorities: you could imagine a system with two aortas.

As a result, I don't think that there would be much antimicrobial effect from the coins. Now, if you did really have copper in the water (like copper piping), then the best antimicrobial effects are likely to come from regular stirring/agitation to make sure the bacteria contact the copper.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Having some tap water sitting in a warm area is not really a \"perfect\" breeding ground for bacteria. A perfect breeding ground would contain nutrients (at the very least, sugar). Whatever bacteria you would find is likely the bacteria that circulates in your home air, or other contaminants (like sneezing).<\/p>\n\n<p>As for your question, how to measure the bacterial load in each bowl, I think the simplest method to do at home would be as @Alan Boyd suggests. Take a small sample of water from each dish, and plate them out on some kind of growth plate (such as a LB agar). After 16-18 hours of growth on the plate, you would just count the number of colonies on each plate, and get a simple measurement of bacterial load from each bowl.<\/p>\n\n<p>The drawback to this method is that it does not tell you what kind of bacteria are growing, or whether they are likely to cause illness (pathogenic).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For reference, <a href=\"http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here is a detailed overview<\/a> of the most common types of agar plates used for microbiology purposes.

However, these pressures do not only depend on the heart's action, but also on blood vessel compliance - which is influenced by ageaing, disease processes, and changes in the concentration of vasoactive substances in the blood.

When about 50.000 neurons fire simultaneously, it possible to see a change in the measured signal. Typical EEG amplitudes are in the microvolt range.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, when the EEG is recorded, it is a function of time. You could for example collect data from 64 sensors, using a typical sampling frequency of 1000 Hz, and obtain 100000 samples from each sensor during a 100 second measurement.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what are alpha, beta, gamma, etc? When the recorded EEG signals are transformed into the frequency-domain (using the discrete Fourier transform), the signals become represented as a function of frequency. The obtained frequency range is half of the sampling frequency (according to the sampling theorem). So, with $f_s = 1 $ kHz you may observe frequencies from $0$ to $500$ Hz. Now, to make it easier to discuss about specific parts of the frequency range, they have been given names: delta refers to frequencies from 0-4 Hz, alpha to frequencies 7-15 Hz etc. So, these are just arbitrary names for different frequency ranges. (And yes, some processes do occur in quite exact ranges.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So what effects what the EEG spectra will look like? Just about everything. From a short segment of data, it is rather impossible to say anything. This is why many paradigms do averaging: for example, you are presented a sound 100 times, and the repetitions are averaged to cancel uncorrelated noise.

Then I went back and read the mouse study you cited a bit more carefully. The mouse study only made a reference to mice being affected at 4 lux, ~100x more sensitive than humans.  However, for that number it cited a paper in Science that has a direct answer.  <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/210/4475/1267\">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/210/4475/1267<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Melatonin concentrations decreased 10 to 20 minutes after the subjects were exposed to 2500-lux incandescent light and reached near-daytime levels within 1 hour (Fig. 1). After the subjects resumed sleeping in the dark, the melatonin concentrations increased immediately and within 40 minutes were at the levels measured before exposure. The fluorescent light (500 lux) did not reduce melatonin, and there was no change after the return to darkness. In the two subjects who were exposed to 1500-lux incandescent light, melatonin concentrations decreased to levels intermediate between those measured during exposure to 500 and 2500 lux (Fig. 2). The return to normal nighttime concentrations after subjects were exposed to 1500 lux was similar to that occurring after their exposure to 2500 lux. The concentration of melatonin in subjects awakened and exposed to 500-lux fluorescent light did not differ significantly from that measured while they were asleep in the dark.<\/p>\n  <\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Since that was the granddaddy study of the subject, I just checked the recent citation list on that page for modern articles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using pure blue LED lights at 446-477 nm wavelengths, West et al. measured light intensities necessary to induce melatonin suppression. Table 1 of that study converts LED irradiance/lux into retinal irradiance (uW/cm2) based on mean pupil size.  Figure 2 shows plasma melatonin falling (p&lt;0.05) at 20 uW/cm2 of corneal irradiance (then curve fit to 14.19 uW/cm2). It's at least twice as powerful as white light, which didn't show significant suppression at 40 uW/cm2, but was \"numerically similar\" to 10 uW/cm2 exposure.  If I've got the conversions right, 20 uW/cm2 is about 136 lux, which is about the brightness of an overcast day or half the brightness of typical office lighting.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/110/3/619.full\">http://jap.physiology.org/content/110/3/619.full<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As for the discrepancy between the two studies (1500 lux vs. 136 lux), I would blame it mostly on technological advances since 1980.  The original study used gas chromatography. You can see the huge error bars and noisy data in the Figure.  The modern study uses a radioimmuno assay using antiserum, and is presumably far more sensitive. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I was also going to mention a nice review paper that summarizes more findings, but apparently I can only post 2 links as a new user.  So I'll just paste the abstract and citation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Light is a potent stimulus for regulating the pineal gland's production of melatonin and the broader circadian system in humans. It initially was thought that only very bright photic stimuli (≥ 2500 lux) could suppress nocturnal melatonin secretion and induce other circadian responses. It is now known that markedly lower illuminances (≤ 200 lux) can acutely suppress melatonin or entrain and phase shift melatonin rhythms when exposure conditions are optimized. The elements for physical/biological stimulus processing that regulate photic influences on melatonin secretion include the physics of the light source, gaze behavior relative to the light source, and the transduction of light energy through the pupil and ocular media. Elements for sensory/neural signal processing become involved as photons are absorbed by retinal photopigments and neural signals are generated in the retinohypothalamic tract. Aspects of this physiology include the ability of the circadian system to integrate photic stimuli spatially and temporally as well as the wavelength sensitivity of the operative photoreceptors. Acute, light-induced suppression of melatonin is proving to be a powerful tool for clarifying how these elements of ocular and neural physiology influence the interaction between light and the secretion of melatonin from the human pineal gland.<\/p>\n  <\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Photic Regulation of Melatonin in Humans: Ocular and Neural Signal Transduction\nBrainard, Rollag, and Hanifin\nJ Biol Rhythms December 1997 vol. 12 no. 6 537-546<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you need more information, I'd start by checking the papers cited by the second paper.

In fact, in perceptrons, people usually use a sigmoid function. That's not a coincidence: it kind of simulates a spike. If you were to model an organism such as C. elegans, whose neurons aren't spiking (but use \"graded action potentials\"), you would use another type of activation function (by the way, if you like the Human Brain Project, you should also check the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWorm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Openworm<\/a> project, which is much more realistic and already gives <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8ogHHwqrkI\" rel=\"nofollow\">some interesting outcomes<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, back to the point. When you try to model learning and generation of memory, you often end up dealing with plasticity. Just a quick explanation: a neuron does fire an Action Potential (AP) when its transmembrane potential gets above a limit. The potential itself changes due to the inputs from other neurons. But all the inputs don't have the same weight. Let's say you look at neuron A, which gets synapses from neurons B, C, D... If B fires at the same time as C, it can be enough to create an AP from A. But, even in combination with B or C, D doesn't elicit enough transmembrane potential variation to create an AP; it has to fire exactly at the same time as E, F, G and H to get enough \"firepower\" to activate A.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if each time D fires, A gets an AP (because of the simultaneous activation of other incoming neurons), then you could say D is \"useful\" for A, and (depending on the type of neuron and other parameters) the weight of D can increase, so that, after a while, D is able to elicit an AP in A just by firing at the same time as any other incoming neuron. That's a plasticity phenomenon. Note that here, it is a really simple hypothetical example. And also that the idea that learning results from plasticity is more and more being challenged.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, if you want to understand how learning and memory happen, you might be interested in the weights of the connections only, and how they evolve depending on the network's activity. In that case, a perceptron model is a good way to go.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, the big new thing these days with artificial neural networks is simulating them with biological precision- that is, with spiking<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, as you already mention in your question, this is a matter of choosing a model that you're going to use (as a researcher trying to understand the brain). This is <em>not<\/em> trying to give an accurate depiction of how the brain really is. If you're interested in the weights of the connections, you can use a neural networks approach (and this is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3876265/\" rel=\"nofollow\">not outdated<\/a>), and you don't care about a single ion channel on the membrane of a neuron. But alternatively, you can also dedicate your life to understanding the structure of a single ion channel, and how simple details can determine the whole working of the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Projects such as the Human Brain Project are trying to create a \"biologically exact\" model of the brain. So, it involves modeling the spikes, as well as the network organization, as well as single ion channels. So, in that case they don't need to use paradigms such as artificial neural networks, since the network's behavior should be a result of the single neurons' modeling: that would be an <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095943881300189X\" rel=\"nofollow\">emergent response<\/a>. However, they don't have anymore the simplifications brought by other models, so, they need huge computational power, and they also face new problems: for example they have to give values to all the individual parameters of their models, some of which are currently unknown, and could even not exist at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, I think this gives answers your question, in the sense that it is not the brain which evolved to pick a model, but the scientists who try to modelize one particular aspect of the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I see in fact this question is quite old; sorry it was a suggestion on the right which brought me here. But I think my answer can still bring an aspect which wasn't already mentioned in the other answers.

The only term that could be higher up is \"medical condition.\"  It could be an infectious disease, genetic disease, induced disease (think chemicals, tobacco, etc), or [insert organ here, ie heart] disease (which are not necessarily genetic).  There are attempts to distinguish between \"diseases\" and \"disorders,\" but the difference is not always clear.  The term \"disorder\" is growing in usage and scope because it is seen as having fewer negative connotations than disease (think disease of the mind vs. disorder of the mind).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus each field has it's own ways of identifying new diseases.  As a general trend new diseases are found now by identifying greater specificity within a previously general disease.  For example, a person could be said to have an \"adrenal cancer,\" but now we would want to know if they have an adrenocortical carcinoma.

The predominant techniques used to identify pathogens relies upon conventional clinical microbiology-based approaches, which has been highlighted in the comments above. However these conventional techniques such as standard culture and susceptibility tests have many drawbacks such as time-consuption and lack of scalability in addition to lack of direct characterisation of virulence factors. Most pathogen (except prions) logically carry a unique DNA or RNA signatures that differentiate it from other organisms, which provides the basis for disease causing pathogen characterisation. According to this <a href=\"http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/pathogen-detection.html\">page<\/a> there are two approaches used to detect a pathogen, once sampling has taken place.<\/p>\n\n<p>1) qPCR based pathogen detection: allowing sensitive and real-time detection of genetic signatures, which is not currently matched by sensors such as immune-assay techniques (lagging in detection time, logistics and costing) and optical techniques (lacking specificity).<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Microarray based pathogen detection: allowing combination of nucleic acid amplification (offered by PCR based techniques) combined with massive screening capability of microarray technology, resulting in high level of sensitivity, specificity, and throughput.<\/p>\n\n<p>These techniques are obviously combined with powerful software technologies required to sieve through the data and allow for easing of experimental burden, minimising assay development as well as operational costs. Now clearly these techniques including sensors and conventional microbiology are used concurrently/synergistically to more efficiently identify a disease causing pathogen and strategies a treatment/preventative measure. This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359816/\">review<\/a> nicely illustrates the molecular basis for pathogen identification and discusses general considerations (in this case for fungus detection) such as DNA extraction methods, sampling preparations and strategies and goes on to highlight some other sequencing independent methods such as FISH and macroarray. <\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.nphl.org/documents/identificationofmicrobialpathogensusingnucleicacidsequencing.pdf\">paper<\/a> writes about sequencing based strategies and using the BLAST (NCBI) tool and talks about identification of variant strains of known species, identification of non-cultivatable pathogens and more importantly related to this question, identification of new species using (rDNA) phylogenetic trees of bacterial 16S gene and the fungal 18S gene, commonly used for this type of analysis. This is done in order to determine the phylogenetic position of a the suspected new species compared to a closely known related species, which is useful when there is a &lt;98% of the sequence similarity with known species. <\/p>\n","answer_id":20533,"question_id":20378,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20378/standard-process-identification-of-new-disease-outbreak-causing-pathogen","last_activity_date":1408143677,"creation_date":1407687392,"answer_count":2,"title":"Standard Process Identification of New Disease outbreak Causing Pathogen","body":"<p>Is the any standard procedure or protocol followed for the identification of cause of new disease outbreak(or new pathogen)?

Therefore, I am afraid that all discussions here will bring anything new to your ethic or religion related discussion.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want to argue that the @user137's answer is very misleading for two reasons. First, he based his discussion exclusively on the \"reproduction ability\" definition of life. Second because his definition of reproduction might be misleading as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reproduction is not only cell division obviously. Following this same definition one would not consider a human to be a living things but only to be a collection of living (and non-living) things. It is important to understand that a spermatozoid is just one phase of a life-cycle. This phase yield to the next phase. That's it. It seems weird to say that a kid is not alive just because he cannot reproduce. It seems weird to say that a grandmother is not alive because it cannot reproduce. You can say however that a kid is a living thing that cannot reproduce and at another moment of its life cycle it will be able to reproduce (assuming it will survive to this age). One should not think of spermatozoids as something totally detached from the human phase as we know it. These things just form a cycle and it seems to me miseleading to say that a part of this cycle is not alive. Saying such thing would yield someone to think that two living things create non-living things that by fusion will become alive. That seems weird. But again, it is nothing but a matter of definition. I cannot say that user137 is wrong, I cannot only say that his definition seem neither useful, intuitive nor common among biologists.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may want to have a look to life-cycle and to understand what are the haplontic and diplontic phases with a bunch of wikipedia readings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other concepts such as the ability to synthesize its own components, having a boundary between interior and exterior and ability to response to environmental stimulis are often used in order to define what is a living thing and what is not.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20442,"question_id":20437,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ecb2130d870caa97f33b9e9e658e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4109,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4109/resonating","reputation":3125,"display_name":"Resonating"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":2,"post_id":20447,"edited":false,"creation_date":1407909022,"comment_id":30717,"body":"I don&#39;t think that because something has life in it, it can be considered alive.

Well he can eat, carry out metabolism, form a habitat but he cannot reproduce. Man as an organism is alive as he can sustain cell division and metabolism within himself but in that restricted zone human population is dying. He is living because he has the <strong>potential<\/strong> to reproduce. It is same as a lone enzyme- it can carry out its metabolism but will one day degrade unless it is re-formed.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Sperm on the other hand is just a vehicle- it doesn't have the potential to sustain itself; its sole aim is to deliver the potential to the egg so that life can be created.<\/p>\n\n<p>To conclude- the question of what is \"life\" is purely philosophical. A more scientific question would be - \"What is a stable, self-sustaining and dynamic biological system\"<\/p>\n","answer_id":20460,"question_id":20437,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1408003870},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08613e0b782cdf2bb8f2501cae9bdc5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":806,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/806/armatus","reputation":5317,"display_name":"Armatus","accept_rate":81},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1408135693,"creation_date":1408135693,"body":"<p>Your best chance of actually reaching an answer <strong>for yourself<\/strong> (*) to this is by parallel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you consider independetly-living single-celled organisms alive?

It may be evolutionary advantageous to keep two nostrils so that an animal can tell what direction a smell is coming from.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, we see that evolution has provided a path to having just one nostril.  Blowholes in toothed whales are just one nostril.  The other nostril does not have an opening to the outside of the whale.  It would be interesting to explore the split between baleen (two nostrils) and toothed whales (one nostril).  This evolutionary divergence may have been caused by differences in communication styles or the different blowholes may have caused a difference in communications <a href=\"http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html\">http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html<\/a> .<\/p>\n","answer_id":20496,"question_id":20467,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1408064184,"creation_date":1408038076,"body":"<p>We have two nostrils for the same reason we have 2 ears and 2 eyes.

While humans no longer rely on smell very much, our distant ancestors and relatives did.

Since the father's lineage has no history of the recessive phenotype(blue), and the genes segregate independently (our assumption), we can conclude that the father is homozygous for the dominant allele in both the genes(<strong>HHOO<\/strong>). In this scenario, it is <em>very unlikely<\/em> to get blue eyed children, but is still possible in the following two ways:-  <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The father's lineage does have a recessive gene (which probably entered his family gene pool due to <em>non-consanguineous<\/em> mates carrying a heterozygous phenotype in either of the gene pair <strong>HERC2<\/strong> or <strong>OCA2<\/strong>), and has evaded expression by <em>pure chance<\/em> or because the recessive gene carrier entered into the family very close to the father,i.e. probably just one or two generations above the father(so that not enough generations have passed to allow the homozygous recessive trait to develop). In each of these cases, one or both the gene loci in the father might be heterozygous(<strong>HhOO<\/strong> or <strong>HHOo<\/strong> or <strong>HhOo<\/strong>) and coupled with the mother's heterozygous genotype(a good guess considering the history of many recessive phenotypes), might produce a blue-eyed child due to homozygosity in any one of the gene.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There is a <em>mutation<\/em> in the germinal cells of the father which creates a non-functional mutant allele and thus can give a blue-eyed child with a heterozygous mother.<br>\nBut in either case, considering independent assortment, the chances are very bleak.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>But if we also take into account the linkage of the two genes, then the probability rises significantly. Now there is a good chance that the father's lineage might contain a heterozygous (or homozygous recessive) allele pair on a single chromosome, which due to their tight linkage, might pass on without any recombinations and therefore might evade phenotypic expression more efficiently(although, since a dominant allele in both the genes is required for the dominant phenotype, the extra evasion efficiency due to linkage is less). As given at the end of your reference, suppose there is one chromosome in the parental ancestry that carries both the recessive genes. If they are linked, the chances of brown eyed parents to have blue eyed children <em>decreases<\/em> (and the chance of being heterozygous also decreases) thus making it more likely that the father's lineage could have a recessive allele in spite of there being no significant expression in his family history. Therefore, more tightly they are linked, greater is the probability that the father is heterozygous. Linkage does not significantly lessen the possibility for the father to have a blue-eyed child since the mother does contain a recessive linked- phenotypic pair in all probability.

Also does the GLP-1 belong the same species that Min-6 originates from or it belongs to a different species? Those are important points since if the receptor is endogenous then the main problem is sensitivity of the detection method, which can be difficult sometimes to detect an endogenous protein relative to an over-expressed one. Also if the GPL-1 belongs to a different species, which you are trying to over express in Min-6 it might not work since the cellular machinery might not support its production (tho unlikely) or its transport to the cell surface, which I have had this problem before. It could be that for the particular expression levels you have in those cells, if the GLP-1 is over expressed or if its non-endogenous, it causes toxicity and kills the cells that are expressing it hence why you do not see any GLP-1 expression (e.g due to excessive receptor activation). Also could you clarify what you mean by \"analogue for glp-1\"? does this mean it is not exactly GPL-1 or its a homologue or orthologue, which you are trying to detect using a GLP-1 specific antibody? that might again be a problem if the GLP-1 Ab you are using detects a region of the receptor, which is not conserved in its homologues.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of solutions as pointed in the comments, the best way to go about this is to use a polyclonal Ab, which is raised against a large section of the peptide in question, allowing you a better chance of its detection.

If you gain one trait, you lose another (or others). Everything in evolution is a tradeoff: that's why you're not nine feet tall, you'd be able to beat up all your enemies great, but it would take so much food to sustain you, it wouldn't be worth it.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Not every trait can be easily evolved. When you're starting as a freshwater plant, there are many, many, many, many mutations that have to occur for you to become salt-tolerant. Every one of those mutations would have to give a fitness advantage to be positively selected. The chances of this happening are low, which means if it happens at all, it would take a long time.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Who knows, perhaps these plants are, slowly, becoming more and more salt-tolerant and you're seeing them at an intermediate point in their evolution. Everything is evolving all the time, if these plants were not in a salty environment until recently, mutation and selection haven't had time to work their magic.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Update from comment:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can you flesh out a little on \"How can the plants keep from intaking salt, while absorbing other soluble nutrients through the roots?\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure! I'll give you the simple answer first: there are different mechanisms for absorbing salt and for absorbing nutrients, so they can function largely independently.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the longer explanation: Salt and nutrients don't just diffuse (much) through cell walls, they have to be transported across by what are called transmembrane proteins. Think of the cell membrane (a layer inside the cell wall) as basically something like a layer of oil (it's called a lipid bilayer) -- you know oil and water don't mut, and for the different ions in salt (sodium ion and chloride), neither do oil and salt or oil and many nutrients so they get sort of escorted across that barrier by big proteins that form sort of a tunnel through it.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's a different transport protein for different substances; the salt ones will only let salt through, and in fact there are different ones for letting salts in and letting salts out, and for the different ions (sodium and chloride) in salt.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update from comment:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This makes me wonder how salt harms most plants, if it can't get in except by 'invitation'<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Quite a bit of salt can diffuse in, the molecules are small enough (unlike most nutrients) to pass through the membrane via the channels that let water in. Every living creature has a quite sophisticated setup of \"ion channels\" to pump salt out. If suddenly its cells are in a very salty environment, these pumps can't keep up.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Update from comment:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So if salt can diffuse in, what do salt-tolerant plants have that other plants don't?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Mostly, if I recall correctly, three things: They will have enzymes that have evolved to work in higher salt concentrations, they will have cellular functions to \"sequestrate\" salt, i.e. store it in organelles called vacuoles instead of leaving it where it can harm other organelles, and of course they will expend more resources on ion pumps to get the salt concentration in the cell to an acceptable level.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19240,"question_id":19239,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1404009725}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19239/how-do-some-plants-grow-in-salt-water-while-others-die","last_activity_date":1407987039,"creation_date":1403395088,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do some plants grow in salt water, while others die?","body":"<p>My question is basically out of curiosity and comes from observing how certain plants (such as mangroves or salt cedar) can grow in seawater.
