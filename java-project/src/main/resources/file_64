I think that TLR simply enhances phagocytosis via signal transduction much like cytokines. As an interesting side note, the TLR is quite ancient in kingdom animalia, having it's origin in sponges  as close to the beginning as you get). Other aspects of the immune system evolved later on specifically in vertebrate. In fact the lymphocytes is unique to jawed vertebrate (aka absent in agnathans and invertebrate) and i don't know much about antibody production in non-mammals.

Amino acids are not symmetrical molecules, therefore reversed linear combination does not create a turned-around (be it chiral or not) form of a similar amino acid.

Drawing the whole molecule may be a solution, but that is too much chore.<\/p>\n\n<p>My solution is to add a small mark (perhaps an arrow, or a > mark) to represent a specific side of the amino acid molecule (amine group or carboxyl group), so that mirroring the sequence (so that the mark would be at the \"other\" side of each amino acid) would actually create a peptide molecule different from reversing the sequence (so that the mark is still at the \"normal\" side of each amino acid). If you think that doesn't look good, you can draw a frame around each amino acid, where one side of the amino acid has a dent and the other side has a bump (to represent the amine and carboxyl groups) so that only a bumped side can connect to a dented side. Mirroring the sequence would also reverse the positions of the bumps and dents, thereby creating a different peptide molecule than merely reversing the sequence while keeping the positions of the bumps and dents in place.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27803,"question_id":27792,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27792/how-many-different-kinds-of-polypeptides-each-composed-of-12-amino-acids-could","last_activity_date":1421554498,"creation_date":1421543033,"answer_count":3,"title":"How many different kinds of polypeptides, each composed of 12 amino acids, could be synthesized using the 20 common amino acids?","body":"<p>How many different kinds of polypeptides, each composed of 12 amino acids, could be synthesized using the 20 common amino acids?<\/p>\n\n<p>The book's answer is $20^{12}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I disagree.

So, from my studies I know that Barr-bodies are not totally inactive, they, in fact, do have some very limited transcriptional activity. It might be low in intensity, but still vital? I'm just guessing.<\/p>\n\n<p>My other guess is linked to the development of a Barr-body in a cell with two active XX chromosomes early during fetal development. So this happens via a process called X-inactivation in which a gene called Xist becomes active on both X chromosomes, then another gene, the Tsix also becomes active on one of the chromosomes and suppresses Xist on the other. The one with the suppressed Xist remains active, the other becomes the Barr-body (the process of selecting which chromosome becomes the Barr-body is random, hence <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat\" rel=\"nofollow\">female mosaicism<\/a>). So, the point is, that for correct X-inactivation, the interplay of two X chromosomes are needed, and people with Turner syndrome have only one. That might be the problem, e.g. the Xist becomes active on the one X they have and starts interfering with the normal functioning of the chromosome, and there's no Tsix to suppress it.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, again, I'm just making educated guesses here.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27690,"question_id":27681,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1421263271},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":27743,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421405584,"comment_id":44699,"body":"That is interesting.

This means that some genes on the Barr body are expressed in XX-females, although often at lower levels compared to the active X-chromosome, and this is part of the normal gene dosage. The \"purpose\" of X-inactivation is usually dosage compensation, so that genes are expressed equally in males and females (and then actually upregulated in both sexes to balance autosomal genes, see e.g. <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.080149/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Dementyeva et al. 2009.

In this way, an Ancestral gene can be mistaken for a more recent evolution of a gene.

In turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid\n  increased the rate of β-amyloid clearance during sleep.

This review surveys key developments leading to the traditional\n  concept. Challenging this concept are novel insights utilizing\n  molecular and cellular biology as well as neuroimaging, which indicate\n  that CSF physiology may be much more complex than previously believed.\n  The CSF circulation comprises not only a directed flow of CSF, but in\n  addition a pulsatile to and fro movement throughout the entire brain\n  with local fluid exchange between blood, interstitial fluid, and CSF.\n  Astrocytes, aquaporins, and other membrane transporters are key\n  elements in brain water and CSF homeostasis. A continuous\n  bidirectional fluid exchange at the blood brain barrier produces flow\n  rates, which exceed the choroidal CSF production rate by far. The CSF\n  circulation around blood vessels penetrating from the subarachnoid\n  space into the Virchow Robin spaces provides both a drainage pathway\n  for the clearance of waste molecules from the brain and a site for the\n  interaction of the systemic immune system with that of the brain.\n  Important physiological functions, for example the regeneration of the\n  brain during sleep, may depend on CSF circulation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2014 - <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/2045-8118-11-10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A new look at cerebrospinal fluid circulation<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sleep fragmentation is present in numerous sleep pathologies and\n  constitutes a major feature of patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\n  A prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity has been\n  shown to be associated to obstructive sleep apnea. While sleep\n  fragmentation has been shown to impact sleep homeostasis, its specific\n  effects on metabolic variables are only beginning to emerge. In this\n  context, it is important to develop realistic animal models that would\n  account for chronic metabolic effects of sleep fragmentation. We\n  developed a 14-day model of instrumental sleep fragmentation in mice,\n  and show an impact on both brain-specific and general metabolism. We\n  first report that sleep fragmentation increases food intake without\n  affecting body weight. This imbalance was accompanied by the inability\n  to adequately decrease brain temperature during fragmented sleep. In\n  addition, we report that sleep-fragmented mice develop glucose\n  intolerance. We also observe that sleep fragmentation slightly\n  increases the circadian peak level of glucocorticoids, a factor that\n  may be involved in the observed metabolic effects. Our results confirm\n  that poor-quality sleep with sustained sleep fragmentation has similar\n  effects on general metabolism as actual sleep loss.

It would be interesting to compare uniflagellate bacteria and bacteria that have a fixed number of flagella. However, I know about <em>E. coli<\/em> and I think there is something interesting to be learned just from them, so I'll continue.<\/p>\n\n<p>You're in luck that you asked this question when you did: <a href=\"http://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01916#F12\" rel=\"nofollow\">a very cool paper (1)<\/a> was published just last year addressing your question. They find that the number of flagella has only a small effect on bacterial motion, but to understand why requires some background (A lot of the following background comes from this paper, which summarizes it pretty well). <\/p>\n\n<p>I would argue that <em>E. coli<\/em> movement is one of the best-understood examples of cell movement we have, with excellent, high-resolution, quantitative data being generated for over 40 years now (the king in this field is Howard Berg at Harvard, if you want to learn more just read a recent review from him). <\/p>\n\n<p><em>E. coli<\/em> have a variable number of flagella, from one to ten or so. They operate in a bundle, but this bundle is highly dynamic due to the way <em>E. coli<\/em> moves. Rather than proceeding continually a straight line like a car, <em>E. coli<\/em> moves by a series of starts and stops called a <a href=\"http://www.cellsalive.com/animabug.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">run-and-tumble<\/a>: the bacteria moves in a straight line for a <em>short<\/em> amount of time (a <em>run<\/em>), and then it stops in its tracks and changes direction (a <em>tumble<\/em>) before starting off again <a href=\"http://jb.asm.org/content/182/10/2793.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2)<\/a>. At a first pass this run-and-tumble behavior is essentially diffusion, the bacteria covers a lot of ground without going anywhere <em>on average<\/em> unless there's some food nearby, in which case the run-and-tumble is slightly biased so that the bacteria drifts toward the food. <\/p>\n\n<p>As I said, during runs the flagella are bundled together and all turning counter-clockwise. A tumble happens when the bacteria sends a signal to the flagella to start turning clockwise. This breaks apart the flagellar bundle and sends all the flagella in different directions. Up until the paper I mention above, it was still not clear exactly how many flagella need to start turning clockwise before the bundle breaks up and a tumble commences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you can see why having more flagella might not necessarily be a good thing: you might be able to move faster during the run (though this is not obvious to me, given the sometimes <a href=\"http://jilawww.colorado.edu/perkinsgroup/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">unintuitive nature (3)<\/a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">low-Reynolds number fluid dynamics<\/a>) but at the same time the flagellar bundle will be more sensitive to break-up because with more flagella come more opportunities for one to start moving counter-clockwise and mess things up.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the authors of the above paper <a href=\"http://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01916#F12\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1)<\/a> find, it turns out that there are correlations between the actions of different flagella in a bundle, so that a bacteria with many flagella effectively acts like a bacteria with fewer flagella. The result is that the overall pattern of run-and-tumble is not much affected by the number of flagella; you might argue that number of flagella has a minor effect on bacterial movement.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you might be interested not in the net movement of a bacteria, but just on its speed when it's moving forward, in the run phase. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find any good measurements of the run velocity of a bacterial cell as a function of number of flagella.

Furthermore, Kavanau (2002) concluded that NREM has evolved in warm blooded animals <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976340200088X\">[2]<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Birds provide a unique opportunity to evaluate current theories for the function of sleep. Like mammalian sleep, avian sleep is composed of two states, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep that apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds. Despite this resemblance, however, it has been unclear whether avian SWS shows a compensatory response to sleep loss (i.e., homeostatic regulation), a fundamental aspect of mammalian sleep potentially linked to the function of SWS. Here, we prevented pigeons (Columba livia) from taking their normal naps during the last 8 h of the day. Although time spent in SWS did not change significantly following short-term sleep deprivation, electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA; i.e., 0.78-2.34 Hz power density) during SWS increased significantly during the first 3 h of the recovery night when compared with the undisturbed night, and progressively declined thereafter in a manner comparable to that observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. SWA was also elevated during REM sleep on the recovery night, a response that might reflect increased SWS pressure and the concomitant 'spill-over' of SWS-related EEG activity into short episodes of REM sleep. As in rodents, power density during SWS also increased in higher frequencies (9-25 Hz) in response to short-term sleep deprivation. Finally, time spent in REM sleep increased following sleep deprivation.

The first part is a theoretical approach based on the absolute possible minimum (my original answer). The second part focuses on experiments in the peripheral auditory system (added edited answer).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PART I: Absolute theoretical minimum (original answer)<\/strong>\nAs you inquire about electrical signals in the auditory human system I have to say that electrophysiological data at such a fundamental level is scarce in humans. That having said, we can start off by looking at <strong>auditory clicks<\/strong>, which are generally the shortest possible well-defined auditory stimuli. The shortest auditory click I was able to find, and which was used in a psychophysical context (i.e., audible to a human) was <strong>10 microseconds<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/49/2B/10.1121/1.1912374\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leshowitz, 1971<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, (1) assuming 10 microseconds is the lower duration limit of a click (it may well be lower), and (2) assuming this click duration is representative of the lower limit of a tonal burst duration limit (it may well not be), and (3) assuming you indeed wish to know about/use auditory tones and not clicks, and finally (4) assuming we need at least one wavelength of a tone to fit in this window, then we could present a frequency of 100 kHz, or higher. As 20 kHz is the upper frequency limit of the human ear, we would need at <strong>least 50 microseconds<\/strong> for one wavelength, i.e., basically what @Dustin concluded, but it does not end here:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Frequency splatter<\/em> (<a href=\"http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~hezy/papers/j28.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fishbach et al., 2001<\/a>) limits the lower limit of tonal stimuli. To prevent spectral splatter one needs to incorporate rise and fall times (ramps) onto the tonal stimulus. Hence, again assuming you do want tonal stimuli, an onset and offset ramp of one wavelength each would be advisable (at the very least) and hence 3 wavelengths are needed, increasing the duration of a 20 kHz tone to 3 wavelengths, i.e., <strong>150 microseconds<\/strong> (spectral splatter may not be prevented, but at least reduced).  <\/p>\n\n<p>On top of this theoretical approach, it has to be noted that I started off with taking a click as a starting point. A click, being an impulse signal, basically stimulates the entire cochlea (the inner ear), and hence represents the most powerful auditory stimulus. Pure-tone bursts are, as a consequence, weak stimuli as they stimulate a small proportion of the available hair cells. High sound levels may therefore be necessary for short tonal stimuli, in turn degrading the frequency resolution in the cochlea as excitation spreads away from the characteristic frequencies. Mostly, several milliseconds are used as tone bursts. <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, taking 20 khz is kind of an upper limit, and many folks are not even able to hear 16 khz. An upper limit of, say, 12 kHz would be advisable when grownups are used. This means a wavelength of 83 microseconds and for 3 wavelengths (for ramp times) that means <strong>250 microseconds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If lower frequencies are needed, this number would increase further.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: PART II. Phsyiological experiments.<\/strong>\nAs you are also interested in electrical signals, we might take another approach and start looking at experimental (animal) data. The temporal limits of the auditory system are generally assumed to reside in the ribbon synapse that is situated between the inner hair cells and the auditory nerve fiber (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/fig_tab/4441013a_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parsons, 2006<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/S4hZg.jpg\" alt=\"RibonSynapse\">   <\/p>\n\n<p>This synapse is considered to be the limiting factor in the temporal characteristics of the auditory system (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7035/abs/nature03418.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khimich, 2005<\/a>). By analyzing this synapse using very short tone bursts, it was shown that the vesicles of glutamate (the neurotransmitter activating the auditory nerve fibers that lead the signal to the brain) were released as shortly as <strong>2 ms after tone onset<\/strong>. Tone bursts were 8 - 16 kHz, 10 ms plateau, 1 ms\nrise/fall (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7035/abs/nature03418.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khimich, 2005<\/a>). Note the tone burstduration and rise fall times mentioned in answer PART I. <\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, when first spike times in auditory nerve fibers were determined, spikes with the shortest latency occurred just under 2 ms (<a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/78/5/2438.long#F12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heil and Irvine, 1997<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eoO3y.gif\" alt=\"First spike times\">  <\/p>\n\n<p>SR in the figure means spike rate, showing that higher spike rates are accompanied by shorter latencies. A1 means auditory cortex neurons, which obviously have longer latencies.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hence, from these experiments I dare say that 2 ms would be sufficient to elicit at least one spike.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Why then leave part I of the answer? The problem is that the experimental data do not show that a spike wouldn't have been generated at shorter stimuli. The data merely show that with an ongoing stimulus the first spike appears at 2 ms. It does not show whether <strong>2 ms of temporal summation<\/strong> is necessary, and that is why I have left part I of my answer in place, as a theoretical lower bound.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a side note: the spike rates are highly dependent on loudness levels. Lower sound levels result in longer latencies. Specificaly, acceleration of the stereocilia on the inner hair cells in the cochlea is the primary parameter. The faster the cilia move, the faster the spike response.    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/78/5/2438.long#F12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heil &amp; Irvine.

The problem is to know the exact bacterial composition as well as the mass of the bacteria. To start, it is necessary to know the number of bacteria in a defined amount of yoghurt. There are scientific publications on this topic, but the numbers in fresh produced yoghurt are in the area of 10<sup>8<\/sup> bacteria per gram yoghurt and declines over time. Based on the numbers in  reference 1 and 2 I use 2x10<sup>8<\/sup> bacteria per gram fresh yoghurt.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other number we need is the mass of one bacterium. This is complicated, as bacteria are very light due to their size and cannot be easily weighted. There are some numbers available (we imply here that all bacteria weight the same, which is of course not the case), and according to them, one bacterium weighs about 1x10<sup>-12<\/sup> grams.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutiplying both numbers gives the amount of bacteria in one gram of yoghurt, around 0.0002 gram or 2mg. One typical sized yoghurt of 150 gram therefore contains about 300mg of bacteria. The weight of the bacteria can thus be neglected against the total weight.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489325/\">Survival of Yogurt Bacteria in the Human Gut<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.de/books?id=uV2Oi0g_TB4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=cfu%20yogurt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=df6xr8ykgA&amp;sig=lUcjh8RQlN31KktcP4oxYUoJp-M&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xu-3VL7aA4SuUaGtgrAC&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cfu%20yogurt&amp;f=false\">Handbook of Food and Beverage Fermentation Technology<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/LouisSiu.shtml\">Mass of a Bacterium<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":27725,"question_id":27713,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27713/how-much-of-the-weight-of-yoghurt-is-due-to-bacteria","last_activity_date":1421341367,"creation_date":1421330379,"answer_count":1,"title":"How much of the weight of yoghurt is due to bacteria?","body":"<p>I recently started making all kinds of bacteria-processed foods by myself (such as yoghurt, but also Sauerteig and so on), and I found myself wondering how much of the weight of these products is actually due to the bacteria themselves in the end.

To estimate a power I need a lion's temperature and its surface area.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.felineconservation.org/feline_species/lion.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site<\/a> the body temperature of a lion is 311.33 Kelvin.<\/p>\n\n<p>I found a calculator that used the DuBois formula for surface area (for humans) and put in 440 pounds and 7 feet 10 for the weight and \"height\" of a (male, adult) lion - this returned a surface area of $3.6\\ m^2$ (about twice a, male human, so sounds roughly ok).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now using the Stefan-Boltzmann formula $P = \\sigma A T^4$, I get the power output of a \"black body\" lion to be about 2 kW.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus $10^{12}$ lions have a power output of $2\\times 10^{15}\\ W$, which is 11 orders of magnitude less than the Sun.<\/p>\n\n<p>But now take the question at its most basic. Compared to the Sun, the lion is a pretty effective power generation unit. The Sun only generates $2\\times 10^{-4}\\ W/kg$, whereas a lion-based power source weighs in with a massive $10\\ W/kg$! <\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Note that the calculation just assumes the Lion can produce this kind of power output whatever environment it is in. In practice a Lion absorbs a large fraction of this power from its surroundings and its internal metabolism does not need (and probably cannot) supply 2kW. Thus the 2kW should be reduced to some extent, though I'm not sure a simplistic $T^4 - T_{\\rm env}^{4}$ calculation can be correct, unless one of you biologists tells me that a Lion's metabolism shuts down once the ambient (African) temperature approaches 311K (I guess in a human a lot of it goes in evaporating sweat?)

In this way, small quantities of blood are delivered into the aorta and a renewed coronary blood supply develops.

Furthermore is that the brain can convert the image to the right way around. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although myopic vision can't cause the inversion, the answer you're looking for is probably that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_adaptation\" rel=\"nofollow\">perceptual adaptation<\/a>, a phenomenon that occurs to correct our vision, comes into play in cases of inversion. The brain \"gets used to\" inverted images and what you visualise becomes the correct orientation. So lets say myopia did cause inversion, the person with naturally inverted vision wouldn't experience anything unusual.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Experimental Evidence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The below text from the wikipedia entry describes an experiment with inverting glasses. These glasses contained prisms that flipped the real world image before it reached the eye.

By day four, the images seen through the instrument were still upside down. However, on day five, images appeared upright until he concentrated on them; then they became inverted again. By having to concentrate on his vision to turn it upside down again, especially when he knew images were hitting his retinas in the opposite orientation as normal, Stratton deduced his brain had reprocessed his vision and adapted to the changes in vision.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/linden%20(1999)%20the%20myth%20of%20upright%20vision.%20a%20psychophysical%20and%20functional%20imaging%20study%20of%20adaptation%20to%20inverting%20spectacles.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A more recent study by Linden <em>et al.<\/em>, 1999<\/a> confirmed the same thing happening with more up to date inverting glasses.

This, in turn, made it possible for metazoans, which at the time had no elaborate body structures and no developed respiratory apparatuses, to actually <em>grow<\/em> larger, since it was possible for cells further away from the surface of an organism to respirate as well.

Also, in recent (current) plants, respiration is a solved problem, so I'm not sure a plant would benefit in any way from elevated O2 levels.

It was tough to research but very worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n<p>LDL is actually not such a bad molecule. It is formed from VLDL/IDL after VLDL/IDL distribute triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesterol esters to peripheral cells. With less to give, LDL subsequently tries to be helpful by providing any needy peripheral cell with leftover cholesterol necessary for plasma membrane synthesis and other cellular functions. In fact, even endothelial cells, which line the vasculature, have LDL receptors to welcome any cholesterol packages from LDL. Another function of LDL is to make HDL even \u2018healthier\u2019 by removing cholesteryl ester from HDL molecules in the periphery and returning it to the liver. <\/p>\n\n<p>Remember that LDL does not contain exactly the same components as its precursors. LDL does not have the ApoE &amp; C proteins that VLDL and IDL have. LDL has only ApoB-100 and a concentrated level of cholesterol. LDL-family receptors generally recognize ApoE and ApoB, which are located on VLDL and IDL, thus easily pulling them into the liver out of the bloodstream, via endocytosis. Because LDL contains only the ApoB protein, it is less easily recognized. Thus, more LDL lingers in the blood. This is supported by the lengths of their half-lives--- with VLDL and IDL half-lives being about 6 hours and LDL half-life being about 3 days. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YiB2a.jpg\" alt=\"Lipoprotein Content\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Where disease comes in is with an imbalance of fat in our diet. This is explained in detail by this extensive article on <a href=\"http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/582014\">Managing Dyslipidemia: The Triglyceride/High-Density Lipoprotein Axis<\/a>. The article explains that disease cannot solely be blamed on LDL alone. A high fat diet leads to elevated triglycerides in the blood stream, which increases blood viscosity, interference with endothelial function, stimulation of arterial inflammation, and interference with normal blood coagulation. These conditions can predispose to atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, there is an up-regulation of protein ApoC-III, which subsequently increases the half-lives of VLDL and IDL particles. It even increases the activity of an enzyme called cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which can exchange cholesteryl ester in HDL and LDL for triglycerides in VLDL and IDL, and vice versa. This leads to change in composition of HDL and LDL, making them more triglyceride-rich, physically smaller, and less interactive with their respective membrane receptors. With HDL even smaller, it is also easily filtered through the kidneys, leading to lower levels. All this means there is more circulating LDL in the blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>LDL enters the endothelium via breaks in the endothelial wall created naturally (by dying or dividing cells) or through injury (by inflammatory processes including infections, chemical exposures) or it leaks in through junctions between endothelial cells when there is high intraluminal pressure (such as in hypertension). From there, LDL can become oxidized and ingested by macrophages, forming foam cells, which can rupture spewing its contents into the surrounding arterial wall, leading to the beginning of atherosclerotic lesion. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why can\u2019t HDL cross through endothelial wall, too? Actually, it can! According to the above-mentioned article, \u201cHDL particles [in its native form] appear to have the potential to delipidate cholesterol from foam cells\u201d at the site of a lesion. With HDL being smaller, it can enter the endothelium to interact with foam cells. Its interaction, however, is the opposite of LDL. Cholesterol is transferred back from the foam cell to HDL, reversing the oxidized LDL-induced process. In addition, \u201cHDL protects LDL from oxidation by [using] metal ions\u201d before oxidized LDL can lead to further damage. This mechanism is still unknown. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why can\u2019t HDL become oxidized, too? Indeed, this can also happen! However, it appears again than oxidized HDL behaves oppositely to oxidized LDL. \u201cOxidative tyrosylation of high density lipoprotein by peroxidase enhances cholesterol removal from cultured fibroblasts and macrophage foam cells [5].\u201d There is a caveat though. This function seems to depend on how HDL is oxidized. If oxidized by copper or hypochlorous acid, HDL \u201closes its ability to remove cholesterol from cultured cells [6].\u201d <\/p>\n\n<p>In short, given the very same conditions including oxidative environment and entry into the endothelial cell, HDL inherently behaves oppositely to LDL. This likely is related to their inherently different composition, but we have yet to understand how this occurs at a molecular level. However, HDL could technically be 'bad' under the right oxidative conditions. In the end, LDL is given a bad reputation because its relatives IDL/VLDL easily escape into other cells via receptors and HDL concentration is lowered partially by renal filtration. <\/p>\n\n<p>References: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=j2BNM6Bv_BEC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;lpg=PA621&amp;dq=how+does+ldl+enter+an+endothelial+cell?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7GF1P9kFB7&amp;sig=C0ytpD4Fi3ksIfehL6g7rXWut-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=76O0VMO8G-mxsAS3t4K4Cw&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20does%20ldl%20enter%20an%20endothelial%20cell%3F&amp;f=false\">Mera, Steven L.

Is the risk much higher when these metals (not their more toxic compounds/salts though) are present in mouth when compared to their being used for food storage or cooking?<\/p>\n","question_id":21687,"tags":["human-biology","toxicology"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":157,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6c9502cdf02f845f9cf74e396019060?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13013,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13013/jasser","reputation":121,"display_name":"Jasser"},"closed_date":1421270423,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":1,"post_id":27677,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421247652,"comment_id":44511,"body":"tree&#39;s do fall down, there may be a benefit, in terms of stability, to growing in a more &quot;balanced&quot; spread of branches but other factors also influence the direction the branches grow e.g. prevailing sun and wind conditions"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6c9502cdf02f845f9cf74e396019060?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13013,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13013/jasser","reputation":121,"display_name":"Jasser"},"score":0,"post_id":27677,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"edited":false,"creation_date":1421252496,"comment_id":44519,"body":"thanks for the info @GriffinEvo"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9bd7c0a93e1587d390866d374842b91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9829,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9829/luigi","reputation":2475,"display_name":"Luigi"},"score":1,"post_id":27677,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421256164,"comment_id":44529,"body":"I think the strength of the tree&#39;s roots are more of a factor in holding it up than the symmetry of its branches"}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27677/how-does-trees-know-to-balance-themselves-so-that-they-never-fall-down","last_activity_date":1421247542,"creation_date":1421245232,"answer_count":0,"title":"How does trees know to balance themselves so that they never fall down","body":"<p>Well i was flying kites today I saw a tree and its branches were spread around in random directions...

It is then called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heterochromia<\/a>. There are two possibilities for different colored eyes, either congenitial (genetic) or acquired. Since you ask only for eye color changes in adults, we can skip here the genetic reasons, as these show up in kids already. If you are interested in them, have a look into the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heterochromia<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basis for our eye color is genetically determined, changes can later occur due to diseases (so if one experiences a change in eye color, it is always a good idea to consult a doctor) and also due to medications. <\/p>\n\n<p>The eye undergoing a change in pigmentation can either lighten up or darken.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuchs_heterochromic_iridocyclitis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fuchs\u2019 Heterochromic iridocyclitis<\/a>:<\/strong> (also known as Fuchs\u2019 Heterochromic uveitis) The change is caused by an eye infection with different microorganisms like Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus or Rubella (an probably others) but it can also have an autoimmune pathology. See reference 1 and 2 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Horner's Syndrome:<\/strong> This is a syndrome which mostly occurs in kids after damages to some nerves. This can lead to insufficient signals towards the pigment production and heterochromia. Rarely this can occur also in adults, where this is called acquired Horner's syndrome, see reference 3 for details.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment_dispersion_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pigmentary Glaucoma<\/a>:<\/strong> In this disease (also known as Pigment dispersion syndrome) pigment cells from the back of the iris float are seperated from the original place and float through the aqueous humor of the eye where they can produce pigment which over time changes the appearance of the eye. See reference 4 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Medications:<\/strong> Some of the medications against glaucoma (the prostaglandins latanoprost and bimatoprost) can cause a deeper pigmentation which will not always diminish after the end of the treatment.

I have a question about eye strain relating to these.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often on a computer, eye strain comes from staring at the monitor for too long of which is the same continuous distance that your eyes have to focus on... thus causing computer vision syndrome (as well as lack of blinking). Meaning you should look at an object far away every X amount of minutes to rest the eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p>How ever in a virtual headset, although the monitor is much closer, it is in 3D (or a fake 3D). So i wondered, does the eye muscles adjust based on this trick of fake 3D. Or will your eyes still focus on the fixed distance to the screen display regardless of the fake 3D perception, meaning you still get eye strain either way?<\/p>\n\n<p>If you imagine looking through a 3D VR Headset, staring at a 3D object in the distance, is that going to create the same change in muscle adjustment in the eye as looking at a physical object in the real world of the same distance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially - 3D VR headsets could reduce the amount of eye strain. Because the eye is busy adjusting all the time for these \"fake\" distance illusions, rather than forced to focus in one way for a long length of time such as a 2D monitor. It might help people who struggle with computer vision syndrome perhaps?<\/p>\n\n<p>Has any studies been done on this?<\/p>\n","question_id":27655,"tags":["eyes","perception","human-eye"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":125,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1421212205},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fff799fabee7a56dd5c44abdbff815d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8161,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8161/slavatron","reputation":600,"display_name":"Slavatron","accept_rate":75},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85bb9e2c9145ecb17430d6fdb574410f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12909,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12909/dustin","reputation":2006,"display_name":"dustin"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1421208783,"creation_date":1421208783,"body":"<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The research team, led by the Durham Centre for Crop Improvement Technology, and including experts at the University of Nottingham, Rothamsted Research and the University of Warwick, have discovered that plants have the natural ability to regulate their growth independently of Gibberellin, particularly during times of environmental stress.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>They found that plants produce a modifier protein, called SUMO that interacts with the growth repressing proteins.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The researchers believe that by modifying the interaction between the modifier protein and the repressor proteins they can remove the brakes from plant growth, leading to higher yields, even when plants are experiencing stress.<a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=19764\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Bacterization is the process by which bacteria applied to the soil and plant parts.

Although similar, it is not RH disease in mammals other than humans."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9cc936f384cbe3ec68ec6da625656d44?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5092,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5092/alexander-ryan-baggett","reputation":121,"display_name":"Alexander Ryan Baggett"},"score":0,"post_id":13812,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"edited":false,"creation_date":1387826121,"comment_id":18546,"body":"@biogirl essentially the difference is that one occurs during pregnancy the other during nursing."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6aabb5db2e167c2927724b38de10bb7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8216,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8216/shamayeta","reputation":154,"display_name":"Shamayeta","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":19469,"edited":false,"creation_date":1404451225,"comment_id":27771,"body":"will need references.."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6aabb5db2e167c2927724b38de10bb7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8216,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8216/shamayeta","reputation":154,"display_name":"Shamayeta","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":19469,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"edited":false,"creation_date":1404453867,"comment_id":27773,"body":"For just the basics on Rh factor you may check out NCERT Biology for class XI.You may check this site out: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system<\/a>           You may also go through: <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rh/\" rel=\"nofollow\">nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rh<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":19469,"edited":false,"creation_date":1404454157,"comment_id":27774,"body":"This being an international forum, many would not be able to access the NCERT class XI textbook for biology.

It cannot simply be expressed by means of size measures, as objects with a fixed size are perceived as smaller when viewed from a distance (<em>perspective<\/em>). A familiar example is the train track:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KKV3V.jpg\" alt=\"perspective\"> <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, visual acuity has to be measured as a function of viewing distance, i.e,  in degrees of visual view. Measured in degrees, the visual acuity of the average normally sighted person is <sup>1<\/sup>/<sub>60<\/sub> degree, or 1 minute of arc (1 MAR) (<a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/visual-acuity/\">Webvision, chapter \"Visual Acuity\", by Kalloniatis &amp; Luu<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Using the basic structure of the eye and some trigonometry one can deduce the smallest visible size :<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H0yS8.jpg\" alt=\"basic structure of the eye\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The trigonometric formula becomes: 2 x d x tan(alpha/2) with d being the viewing distance and alpha the visual acuity expressed in radians (pi*degrees/180) (<a href=\"https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/Introduction/visualacuity.htm\">NDT resource center<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming the closest distance an adult can focus (~100 mm) and an average maximal acuity of 1 MAR, the smallest visible size boils down to <strong>29 microns<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>A young child can focus at distances down to ~50 mm, and can have a visual acuity of 0.4 MAR, which yields <strong>6 microns<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that 1 MAR encompasses 288 microns on the retina, and some 180 photoreceptors. The optical limitations of the eye (such as diffraction by the lens and light scatter by the neural cells in the retina) limits the resolution of the human eye below the theoretical 'pixel limit' of the eye.<\/p>\n\n<p>So to sum up, depending on one's age, one should be able to see targets in the order of 6 - 29 microns.

While it's meant for RT-PCR, we've been using it for melt curves and binding assays for different types of RNA using thiazole orange as the intercalating fluorophore. However, when we tried to get serious about this assay and do things in triplicate we noticed that the well to well variation was terrible, making statistical significance difficult to get.<\/p>\n\n<p>After reading through the manual I tried to get \"persistent well factors\" for the instrument to correct for this variation. However, the instrument's protocol for this requires heating to 95\u2070C, so intercalating fluorophores won't work, the RNA melts and fluorescence is lost, so I tried with fluorescein. This didn't solve the variation.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I tried to make my own well factors by making 10mL of Poly(rA) Poly(rU) RNA solution with thiazole orange and filling 96 PCR tubes with 100µL each and measuring fluorescence. Then I calculate the average fluorescence and divided the average by the value for each well to determine a factor, F, for each well. Then I tried to normalize subsequent experiments by multiplying each well's fluorescence by its F to get a corrected value. However, while this reduces the variation a little, it's still pretty bad.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you have any suggestions to reduce the well to well variation in these experiments or otherwise correct the data?<\/p>\n\n<p>I have no prior experience with RT-PCR instruments, everything I know about it comes from playing around with the instrument.

I agree that a narrowed down version that builds on e.g. the average time to reprodutive isolation in mammals could be interesting."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":27628,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1421152567,"comment_id":44375,"body":"@fileunderwater: that is indeed a valid and very acceptable reason for closure (although I still vote for re-opening :-).

As the mosquitoes breed, it spreads through the population. In an interview, the lead researcher stated:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the lab, we saw the mutation spread to more than half the population of mosquitoes we had living in cages. This happened in a time span of 12 to 16 generations of mosquitoes (each generation being between 18 to 30 days in the wild). So it's quite efficient.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>12 to 16 generations<\/strong> for one mutation to spread to half of a contained population.

No one knows. <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a cystic-fibrosis type mutation (one gene) that increased the viscosity of cervical mucus such that normal sperm could not fertilize the egg. There would need to be another mutation in males that would make sperm stronger, or secrete an enzyme that breaks down mucus, or something to that effect. However, look at Cystic Fibrosis. People used to die before adulthood. Most men with CF are sterile. Women with CF, living longer now because of better care and treatment, are getting pregnant, but many have a decreased lifespan post-pregnancy, and almost all the babies are premature. You can't predict \"when\" a series of beneficial mutations so dramatic as to change a being so dramatically. The answer might be never.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to give me a single or a few mutations that would prevent the ability of people from one population and another to mate. Say one mutation led to a smaller pelvis. Most women with that mutation would die in childbirth before a mutation arose to make smaller babies (which would most likely be a deleterious mutation as well).<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not a geneticist (which is really the person who should be answering this question) but I think the odds of this scenario ever occurring are very low.

A Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism (SNP) is a kind of genetic variation that you find in population. This genetic variation is defined as a variation caused by only one single nucleotide (as its name indicates it). For example if you have in the populations the two following variants at the same locus: <code>AGCCGT<\/code> and <code>AGCTGT<\/code>, then you have a SNP at the position of the C and T. This type of variation is very common. We estimate that there are about 10 millions SNPs in the human genome. We often use these SNPs as genetic markers.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ancestral vs derived alleles<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>An ancestral allele or an ancestral trait (depending on whether you look at the phenotype or a t the genotype) is the trait/allele that was carried by the common ancestor of the taxon you consider. For example: as you may know the taxon Reptilia includes lizards, snakes, turtles, birds, mammals and some other lineages. In the taxon Reptilia, the scales is the ancestral state (still exist in lizards for example) and the hairs and feathers are derived states. Usually, the ancestral state is the one that carried by the most basal lineages.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Identity by state (IBS) and Identity by descent (IBD)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If two sequences are exactly identical, then we say that they are identical by state (IBS). Such identity can occur either through convergent evolution or through common ancestry.<\/p>\n\n<p>To understand the concept of \"identical by descent\" (IBD) it is important to understand the concept of coalescence. A coalescent event is, when looking backward in time, an event where two sequences were actually the same sequence. Often IBD is defined relatively to a given threshold in time. If the coalescent event occurs after this event then the two sequences are not IBD. If the two sequences coalesce before this time threshold and that the two sequences are still IBS, then the two sequences are IBD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bridging everything together<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So, if you look at sequences in a given group of lineages and see that they are all exactly the same then they are identical by state. If you know that all these sequences come from a common ancestor and even they all coalesce to a single individual in the common ancestor, then all sequences are identical by descent. But some mutations may have occurred since the last common ancestor resulting in some SNPs, then all the sequences are not IBS anymore and therefore not IBD either. You can use such sequence variance in order to create a phylogeny for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19160,"question_id":19159,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1403031053}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19159/ancestral-allele-explanation","last_activity_date":1421136968,"creation_date":1402988021,"answer_count":1,"title":"Ancestral Allele explanation","body":"<p>I'm having some trouble understanding the concept of ancestral allele.

Neglect occurs due to unilateral parietal brain lesions. For example, a lesion in the right hemisphere may induce left-sided neglect, where the left part of the visual field is seen, but simply not processed and neglected (<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FGilles_Rode%2Fpublication%2F13542141_Prism_adaptation_to_a_rightward_optical_deviation_rehabilitates_left_hemispatial_neglect%2Flinks%2F09e4150dc9e1cbad95000000.pdf&amp;ei=d0SzVNvVGYiN8QWoq4G4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFgi6hAQXMNrya4lXzWajDikfKpA&amp;sig2=YHJbnlbc06fdQrrN2jsacA&amp;bvm=bv.83339334,d.dGc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosetti et al., 1998<\/a>). Wearing prism goggles for approximately 6.5 hours/day, over the course of 2 weeks has been shown to reduce the symptoms of neglect significantly by as long as 17 weeks(!) after treatment (<a href=\"http://www.cisi.unito.it/neuropsicologia/didattica/materiali/approfondimenti/neglect/2002/frassinetti.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frasinetti et al., 2002<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>For the treatment of a neurological disorder such as neglect adaptation to prism glasses is great. However, treating healthy controls with comparable methods may induce unwanted side effects. 15 min of prism exposure has been shown to lead to several degrees of error in pointing tasks, for up to two weeks after the adaptation in normally sighted controls (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03213965?LI=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klapp et al., 1974<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>To mention some studies closer to your question: in a virtual reality experiment subjects wore a head-mounted display that shifted the virtual position of their eyes. Their performance on a hand-eye coordination task first decreased by ~40% and then increased again with ~30% after adapting to the display. After taking the display off, there were transient after-effects, that impacted eye-hand performance (<a href=\"http://www.creol.ucf.edu/Research/Publications/1502.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rolland et al, 1995<\/a>; <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/105474698565703\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biocca &amp; Rolland, 1998<\/a>). In other studies wearing a head-mounted display longer lasting discomfort was reported in 5% of the subjects (<a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6788197&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6788197\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobb et al., 1999<\/a>) as well as binocular stress after removal of the display (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-1313.1993.tb00496.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Mon-Williams et al., 1993<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Although the latter studies did not report serious after-effects, the more rigorously performed studies with the prism glasses have shown long-standing effects after visual adaptation. Hence, although the performance with virtual-reality head-mounted displays and comparable devices will undoubtedly increase after adapting to them, visual functions in everyday life may correspondingly be compromised. <\/p>\n\n<p>So although this answer may not be addressing all your practical questions, I would say it is not advisable to let one actively adapt to head-mounted displays, or other wearable virtual-reality glasses that change visual function in the first place.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/105474698565703\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biocca &amp; Rolland, <em>Presence<\/em> 1998; <strong>7<\/strong>:262-77<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6788197&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6788197\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobb et al., <em>Presence<\/em> 1999; <strong>8<\/strong>:169-86<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-1313.1993.tb00496.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frasinetti et al., <em>Brain<\/em> 2002; <strong>125<\/strong>:608-23 <\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03213965?LI=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klapp et al., <em>Perception &amp; psychophysics<\/em> 1974; <strong>15<\/strong>: 399-400<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763405000059\" rel=\"nofollow\">Redding et al. <em>Neurosci Biobehav Rev<\/em> 2005; <strong>29<\/strong>:3, 431-44<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.creol.ucf.edu/Research/Publications/1502.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rolland et al., IEEE Proceedings of VRAIS 1995<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FGilles_Rode%2Fpublication%2F13542141_Prism_adaptation_to_a_rightward_optical_deviation_rehabilitates_left_hemispatial_neglect%2Flinks%2F09e4150dc9e1cbad95000000.pdf&amp;ei=d0SzVNvVGYiN8QWoq4G4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFgi6hAQXMNrya4lXzWajDikfKpA&amp;sig2=YHJbnlbc06fdQrrN2jsacA&amp;bvm=bv.83339334,d.dGc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosetti et al. <em>Nature<\/em> 1999; <strong>365<\/strong>:166*9<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":27605,"question_id":27507,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1421109331}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27507/using-perceptual-adaptation-for-enhancing-realism-of-vr-other-entertainment","last_activity_date":1421109331,"creation_date":1420811927,"answer_count":1,"title":"Using perceptual adaptation for enhancing realism of VR/other entertainment","body":"<p>I am quite a fan of the recent oculus rift VR glasses, but it does have several flaws over normal vision, most notably a much less wide field of view, the so-called screen door effect because of too low resolution (<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8WnDnmt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">example 1<\/a>, <a href=\"http://mkeblx.net/uploads/oculus-sim.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">example 2<\/a>) and often also a certain latency between head movements and corresponding view angle change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Could one, in theory, create glasses which have these limitations to wear during everyday life to adapt to them, and later have the benefit of a more \"realistic\" experience?<\/p>\n\n<p>I know making the glasses is not trivial, I'm just asking about whether the perceptual adaptation part would even work as intended, what timeframe I could expect to adapt in, and how stringent the wearing of them has to be (is waking up without them ok, or should sleep be blindfolded, etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have experience/advice/knowledge on the subject, maybe even links to prior applications?<\/p>\n","question_id":27507,"tags":["vision","perception","neuroplasticity"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":139,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bff9e0b855b3a71885b0a3976b6a4a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11855,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11855/blacktree","reputation":394,"display_name":"Blacktree","accept_rate":80},"closed_date":1421107127,"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78f38914e0d07733567672a47c53904b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8015,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8015/hav0k","reputation":1090,"display_name":"Hav0k"},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1421105049,"creation_date":1421105049,"body":"<p>The distinction between male and female is not that clear in plants, at least at the level of individuals.

For example, several repressors allow the\n  simultaneous binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, but interfere\n  with subsequent events of the initiation process, eventually\n  inhibiting transcription initiation. The recent increase in the number\n  of repressors for which the repression mechanism has been\n  characterized in detail has shown an amazing variety of strategies to\n  repress transcription initiation. It is not surprising to find that\n  the repression mechanism used is usually exquisitely adapted to the\n  characteristics of the promoter and of the repressor involved.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some justification on why the number activators would be more:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A network perspective:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Lets assume an that gene-<strong>A<\/strong> somehow causes the repression of the gene-<strong>B<\/strong>.

However, these animals usually have other modes of oxygenation such as through the skin. <\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, the short answer is- yes, probably, humans can survive without the R atria but it would not be without serious consequences in quality of life. <\/p>\n","answer_id":27559,"question_id":27532,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27532/can-humans-live-without-their-right-atrium","last_activity_date":1421065769,"creation_date":1420893769,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can humans live without their right atrium?","body":"<p>The right atrium  is one of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) in the hearts of mammals (including humans) and archosaurs (which include birds and crocodilians).

Hence, blood group O can be received by all other groups, and is therefore the universal donor. <\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, literature on transfusion deals with the haplotyping the antigens of the donor RBCs. The question whether the <strong>antibodies in the donor's blood<\/strong> with blood group O would <strong>start attacking cells<\/strong> in recipient with blood group A, B and AB is, therefore, a very good question.

In the case of albino-ism, the skin is pink - no melanin pigment is made at all.  This is a case of both copies of a vital gene being defective and an ability lost completely. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some cases of genetically inherited diabetes (&lt;1%) dwarfism and obesity are examples of this.  There are many others - most genetic diseases are like this.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be caused by a single mutation in each defective gene, and others an entire segment of the chromosome can be lost or disrupted by a new, often nonsensical sequence dropped into the gene region.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other changes can affect the way the genes turn on and off. - similar sequence changes in the regulatory sequences next to the gene sequence will make the gene behave differently. Even babies of african descent may be born with blonde hair and blue eyes and get the darker pigmentation later.  this is genetically caused by a change in they timing of the genes for hair and eye color turning on at other times (blonde hair and blue eyes have little or no pigment, so if the genes are off, then this is what you get).  So when genes are active can cause dominant (always on) versus recessive (sometimes off) patterns. which are because one copy of the gene behaves differently than the other copy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a single mutation in one copy of the gene can cause rather interesting effects. A single good gene and a mutated, less effective gene might result in lost of activity because the mixture of the two genes is different between a wholly functional or wholly variant set of genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>A classic example is the sickle cell trait of hemoglobin.  two copies of sickle cell hemoglobin causes the red blood cells to be stiff and misshapen which in turn causes a painful condition in the carrier.  a person with a single copy of the sickle cell gene does not have this problem - is nearly asymptomatic. So we say sickle cell anemia is recessive for the HbS mutation.  but in reality there is plenty of the HbS version of hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood cells, just that the mixture of the two does not cause the anemia.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of other specific cases on how dominant and recessive effects happen, but this might give you a picture. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":1318,"question_id":1294,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dbe760221f32f95b2929618a8e23ec84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":204,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/204/amy","reputation":1824,"display_name":"Amy"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":1325,"edited":false,"creation_date":1331108903,"comment_id":1633,"body":"+1 for the quote on phenotypes."}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1331062568,"creation_date":1331062568,"body":"<p>Sorry to blockquote, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">this note from wikipedia<\/a> gets to the heart of the question: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Which trait is dominant?<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The terms dominant and recessive refer to the interaction of alleles in producing the phenotype of the heterozygote.

The key concept of dominance is that the heterozygote is phenotypically identical to one of the two homozygotes.

It is unrelated to the nature of the phenotype itself, e.g., whether it is regarded as normal or abnormal, standard or nonstandard, healthy or diseased, stronger or weaker, or more or less extreme. It is also important to distinguish between the \"round\" gene locus, the \"round\" allele at that locus, and the \"round\" phenotype it produces.

It does not directly answers your question but understanding how it is thought to evolve also help understand the mechanism governing dominance relationship between alleles.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are several hypotheses about the evolution of dominance. It is important first of all, to note that empirical observations show that <em>beneficial alleles tend to be more dominant than detrimental alleles<\/em>. Among the two main hypotheses to explain the evolution of dominance, one has been formulated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ronald Fisher<\/a> and one by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sewall Wright<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Fisher's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Fisher's hypothesis, between two equally beneficial alleles, if one is more dominant than the other than it's heterozygote carrier will have higher fitness. In consequence, beneficial alleles evolve to become more dominant while detrimental alleles evolve to be recessive (so that they can hide from selection in heterozygotes).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Wright's hypothesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>According to Wright's hypothesis, beneficial alleles are more dominant because of the kinetic of biochemical reactions. The rate of a biochemical reaction is a function of the concentration in the substrates of interest. The function is called \"Michaelis-Menten function\" after the name of the authors. The Michaelis-Menten function looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFgql.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Think about a knock-out mutation. Such mutation will decrease by half the concentration of protein the gene in question produce in heterozygotes. Imagine, the concentration of proteins in the wildtype homozygote was 3 (see above graph). The rate of reaction of this homozygote is therefore about 3. The heterozygote would have a concentration of 1.5 and the rate of the reaction is therefore about 2.5-2.75. Assuming that the rate of this biochemical reaction is directly related to fitness, then a the locus of interest, benefical alleles are necessarily dominant and detrimental alleles are necessarily recessive. Selection for dominance is not involved in Wirght's model.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is Fisher's or Wright's hypothesis correct?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Current state of the art is to consider Wright's model to be correct and Fisher's model to be wrong. In reality, the truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes. Note also that some other alternative explanations may exist in the literature but Wright and Fisher original hypotheses are by far the most considered hypotheses for the evolution of dominance. During my undergrad, I remember a speaker (but I forgot his name, sorry!) who showed that some alleles actually have some domain that are directly responsible for decreasing the expression of the other allele on the sister chromosome suggesting that Fisher's hypothesis might sometime be a good explanation as well.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27594,"question_id":1294,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":1,"post_id":27600,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421050758,"comment_id":44282,"body":"Small addition: there is another related phenomenon called leucism (which also is characterized by loss of body pigmentation).

AS @Larry_Parnell indicates, in blue eyes the eyes do not contain the pigment melanin and are therefore blue (the blue color is caused by non-pigmented optic effects). Brown eyes are therefore dominant as the melanine colors the eyes such that the blue color is masked (it is still there though).

Inbreeding and Variance Effective Numbers in Populations with Overlapping Generations. Genetics 68(4): 581\u2013597. \">Felsenstein (1971)<\/a>, which is based on life table information. This paper includes several derivations, both on inbreeding $N_e$ and variance $N_e$. As an example, the formula of inbreeding $N_e$ for a diploid population is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$N_e = \\frac{N_1T}{1 + \\sum_i^\\inf l_i s_id_i v_{i+1}^2}$<\/p>\n\n<p>Here, $T$ is the generation time, $l_i$ is the survival up to age i, $s_i$ is the survival from age i, $d_i$ is the probability of death at the end of age i (i.e. 1-$s_i$), and $v_{i+1}$ is the reproductive value of individuals in stage i+1. However, this is assuming a constant population size and a stable age distribution, so some rather restrictive assumptions. The paper also includes models for haploid populations, and I haven't gone through it carefully.<\/p>\n\n<p>A couple of more recent papers that calculate $N_e$ for overlapping generations are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450432/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Engen et al. 2005. Effective Size of a Fluctuating Age-Structured Population. Genetics 170(2): 941\u2013954.\">Engen et al. (2005)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17683430\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Engen et al. 2007. Effective size of fluctuating populations with two sexes and overlapping generations. Evolution 61(8):1873-1885\">Engen et al. (2007)<\/a>. These papers use diffusion approximations to derive several formulas for $N_e$ under different assumptions, for age-structured density independent populations. One model for a haploid population in a fluctuating environment is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\begin{align} \nN_e &amp; = \\frac{N}{\\sigma_d^2T} \\text{, with} \\\\\n\\sigma_d^2 &amp; \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^k \\frac{\\lambda^{-2}}{u_i} \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{\\delta b_i}\\right)^2\\sigma_i^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{\\delta s_i}\\right)^2 s_i(1-s_i) + 2\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{\\delta b_i}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{\\delta s_i}\\right) c_i \\right] \n\\end{align}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $T$ is the generation time and $\\sigma_d^2$ is the demographic variance. In the lower equation, $\\lambda$ is the deterministic growth rate (dominant eigenvalue), $u_i$ is the proportion of the population in stage i (a component of the stable age distribution), $b_i$ is the expected number of offspring with variance $\\sigma_i^2$, $s_i$ is the survival rate of stage i (with binomial variance), and $c_i$ is the covariance between reproduction and survival. You really need to dive into these papers to fully understand how these equations are derived and how the variables are defined (will take up far to much space here). However, at its core, it is using a diffusion approximation on an allele at a selectively neutral locus.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many other papers out there deriving effective population sizes, under different assumptions and restrictions, but the ones cited above should be a good starting point, and by looking at citations to and from these you should get a decent overview of the topic. Many textbooks also cover ways to calculate effective population sizes with overlapping generations, e.g. <a href=\"http://books.google.se/books/about/Genetics_of_Populations.html?id=pBq69Luwf7UC&amp;redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Hedrick. 2011.

At the moment, I can't find it but will update if or when I do.<\/p>\n\n<p>The article goes on to state that during times of scarcity the number of male births outweighs the number of females whereas in times of plenty, the number of female birth outweighs the number of males. I will let you read linked article but give you the information I recall from the more recent article I can't locate at the moment. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason for the differences in births has to do with the lifestyles men and women lead. Men tend to do more dangerous activities at younger ages which causes unnatural deaths early on. Due to these unnatural deaths, in times of scarcity, the reproducing population converges to 1:1 (not exactly) male to females due to the lifestyle choices of men. It was also hypothesized that women are almost guaranteed to find a mate so having less females during rough times wont hurt the population since they should all find a mate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the phenomenon of environmental factors influencing male and female births is well documented in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5860/abs/296850a0.html\">alligators<\/a>. The first linked article also goes on to examine this occurring with other species as well.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks to @Anne, who sent me a discover article, we have the name of two sets of researchers on this topic. Here is an exert from the article. The article can be found <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2013/nov/08-sex-ratios\">here<\/a>. Additionally, we can look up the articles by the respected researchers now. I believe the research by Robert Trivers and mathematician Dan Willard will be the most applicable. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While demographers were struggling to understand sex ratio anomalies in the context of culture, evolutionary biologists had largely embraced an idea put forth in 1973 by biologist Robert Trivers and mathematician Dan Willard. The Harvard-based pair theorized that as the physical condition of a female declines \u2014 if she\u2019s nutritionally deprived, for example \u2014 she\u2019ll tend to produce a lower ratio of male to female offspring. Evidence of the theory came from red deer and humans; in both species, adverse conditions in the mother\u2019s environment during pregnancy are correlated with a shift toward female births. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Although natural selection ideally favors a 50/50, or .500, sex ratio in a population, mammals typically produce slightly more males than females. Because sex ratio is biased toward males, the figure is expressed by dividing male births by total births. It\u2019s estimated that women give birth to 3 percent more boys, for a standard .515 sex ratio (with 48.5 percent female births). When fewer boys and more girls are born than that, it\u2019s described as a sex ratio decline. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Evolutionary biologists say male mortality, which is overall higher than that of females, explains the male bias in sex ratio: A slightly skewed sex ratio at birth that favors males ensures that there are roughly an equal number of males and females of reproductive age. (Theoretically, a .500 sex ratio at birth may be possible if the gender difference in mortality is eliminated.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Again thanks to @Anne, who provide this link as well, we see that men do outpace female births.

I'm in no way an expert on human reproduction.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>First, I'm not sure if you are asking about <em>evolutionary reasons<\/em> or the  <em>developmental causes<\/em> for for a difference in sex ratio. Here, I will focus on the <em>developmental causes<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is much evidence for a male bias in human sex ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio), and the ratio have been shown to change over time, e.g. as in 20th centrury Europe after WWI and WWII (see data in <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11692-008-9046-3\">Gellatly, 2009<\/a>),in relation to environmental or parental factors (see e.g. <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/12/3120\">Jacobsen et al, 1999<\/a>), or between ethnic groups.<\/p>\n\n<p>A bias in sex ratio can be due to (at least) three different mechanisms (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455630/\">Irving et al (1999)<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>deviations in X/Y-ratio of sperm<\/li>\n<li>selection of sperm within the female reproductive tract<\/li>\n<li>biases in implantation success and/or survival for embryos of different sex<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I guess that success of fertilization/zygote formation could maybe be considered a separate step (between 2-3). From what I've seen, there is little evidence for explanation one, see tests in e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455630/\">Irving et al (1999)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/11/2917.full\">Graffelman et al (1999)<\/a>. <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/11/2917.full\">Graffelman et al (1999)<\/a> also tests for an effect of male age, but do not find support for this idea. <\/p>\n\n<p>A problem is that it is extremely difficult to study these factors under natural conditions (practically and ethically). Interestingely, there is also evidence for an excess loss of male fetuses in recognized pregnancies (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2003.00022.x/abstract;jsessionid=C12E828425BF6DB14C1699ECE1F567D1.f01t01\">Ingmarsson, 2003<\/a>, <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/583.long\">Boklage, 2005<\/a>), and this would indicate that the sex ratio close to conception is even more skewed towards males than the sex ratio at birth. This is even more curious with the background of an unbiased sex ratio in sperm (explanation 1 above). However, it is very problematic to study what happens in the first part of pregnancies, since a number of weeks have usually passed before the pregnancy is even recognized. I haven't found any papers reporting the human primary sex ratio (sex ratio at conception), which could be affected by factor 1 &amp; 2 above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even so, the most likely explanation seems to be a strong bias during embryogenesis, as mentioned in <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/583.long\">Boklage (2005)<\/a>: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The usual excess of males is present through pregnancy beyond clinical recognition, but not present at fertilization. The difference, therefore, must arise between fertilization and clinical recognition, through a preferential loss of females during embryogenesis. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The same paper also points out that fewer than 25% of natural human fertilizations go full term (probably even less), and 2/3 of these fail before the pregnancies have been clinically recognized. By back-calculating from the secondary sex ratio and the excess of failed male pregnancies, the sex ratio close to conception has been estimated to 125-135 male:100 female (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648310615969#\">Pergament et al, 2002)<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>The exact causes for such a bias during is not entirely known from what I've seen. However, <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/583.long\">Boklage (2005)<\/a> mentions a couple of different explanations. For instance, among mammals in general, the earliest stages of embryogenesis proceeds more rapidly in male embryos:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since some of the products of these earliest stages are signals from one part of the embryo to another, or from the embryo to the maternal physiology, signals which are required for continuation and maintenance of the pregnancy, the establishment of viable, clinically recognizable pregnancy is correspondingly more efficient in general for male embryos (Krackow, 1995; Kochhar et al., 2003). <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The same issue is also mentioned in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2003.00022.x/abstract;jsessionid=C12E828425BF6DB14C1699ECE1F567D1.f01t01\">Ingvarsson (2003)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Studies in recent years indicate that sex differentiation begins at conception. The SRY gene on the Y-chromosome is already transcribed at the 2-cell stage and triggers growth acceleration in the XY embryos. This accelerated growth is believed to be important for the male embryo as it allows complete testicular differentiation before the levels of oestrogenic hormones become too high as pregnancy progresses.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/583.long\">Boklage (2005)<\/a> also mentions genomic imprinting and chromosome X\u2013Y segregation as possible explanations for a bias (see references in paper for more).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>in summary<\/strong>; there is evidence for an male bias in secondary sex ratio (sex ratio at birth), even though there is usually a excess of failed male fetuses in recognized pregnancies, which means that the male bias must be even higher very early in pregnancies. There is some evidence that this might be due to a higher success of embryogenesis of male fetuses, but the evidence isn't strong and the issue is difficult to study.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The evidence provided by these results is indirect. That is unlikely to change. Ethical, technical and financial considerations argue against the destruction for karyotyping of statistically sufficient numbers of products of natural human fertilizations. Granted, any bias of the sort we seek to discover and understand might, after all, operate differently, or not at all, in sham fertilizations of hamster oocytes, versus oocytes from artificially induced human ovulations, versus naturally fertilized human oocytes. The best evidence we have, or are likely to have in the foreseeable future, indicates that the consistent excess of males observed in human births does not originate in a consistent bias in spermatogenesis or in fertilization. \n  (<a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/583.long\">Boklage, 2005<\/a>)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, it should also be mentioned that the bias in sex ratio at birth can be partially due to sex-selective abortion and infanticide, but to what extent is not entirely known (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion\">Wikipedia: Sex-selective abortion<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>You might also find this related question on the heritability of sex ratio interesting: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23548/the-gender-of-offspring-of-twins/23553#23553\">The gender of offspring of Twins?<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":27610,"question_id":27582,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1421055954}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27582/why-do-we-have-more-male-infant-born","last_activity_date":1421056385,"creation_date":1420991389,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why do we have more male infant born?","body":"<p>For every 104 male babies,we have 100 female babies and there is a Statistics which is more reliable (we have 997 female infant born per 1000 male infant born). what's the reason? why do we have male babies more than female?<\/p>\n","question_id":27582,"tags":["human-biology","human-genetics","sexual-selection","reproductive-biology"],"score":8,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":455,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1421056385},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8857b5da1924d857058a5cc2705899e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8142,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8142/piscean-1993","reputation":119,"display_name":"piscean_1993","accept_rate":80},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":0,"post_id":27608,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421044026,"comment_id":44272,"body":"I suppose you could get an estimate if you made a calibration curve with known concentrations of protein, then try to match the intensity of your unknown with the calibration curve.

If it's not in the lymphatic system, it is not lymph fluid. Thus, your question is really asking about interstitial fluid or the plasma that was filtered out of blood capillaries.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is based on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_equation\">Starling equation<\/a>. Normally fluid leaves a capillary due to a net pressure that favors the interstitium. This net pressure is based on the hydrostatic pressure within the capillary being greater than the interstitial pressure of the surrounding tissues, and the oncotic pressure of the capillary (that draws fluid in) being weaker than the hydrostatic pressure of the capillary (that pushes fluid out). At the venule end of this system, the capillary oncotic pressure is stronger than the capillary hydrostatic pressure, drawing fluid back into the circulatory system.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4irFO.png\" alt=\"Filtration in Systemic Capillaries\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Remember that albumin is the most important component which establishes the oncotic pressure within a vessel, and that this protein is normally NOT released out of a vessel during filtration. Thus, it passes from the capillary into its corresponding venule directly.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3MBy.jpg\" alt=\"Microcirculation\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, plasma that enters the interstitium contains many of the same components as when it is in the blood, but the main difference is the protein content, losing the majority of proteins as it enters the interstitium. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if you are asking how the majority of LYMPH fluid re-enters the blood stream, the answer is through the R lymphatic and L lymphatic (aka thoracic) ducts, at the location of the R subclavian or R internal jugular, and L subclavian veins, respectively. Once fluid enters lymphatic capillaries, it goes through a system of lymphatic vessels, trunks, and finally, the above mentioned ducts to rejoin blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.biog1445.org/demo/06/lymphaticsys.html\">http://www.biog1445.org/demo/06/lymphaticsys.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/in_mow/classes_stud/uk/med/medprof/ptn\">http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/in_mow/classes_stud/uk/med/medprof/ptn<\/a>/англійська%20мова%20за%20професійним%20спрямуванням/2/№%2003.%20Heart...htm<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":27597,"question_id":27584,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27584/how-does-most-of-lymph-get-back-into-the-blood-stream-i-dont-mean-the-lymphat","last_activity_date":1421011237,"creation_date":1420993903,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does most of lymph get back into the blood stream?

The brain regulates the core-body temperature in response to temperature measured through skin. If a person is exposed suddenly to cold environment, skin looses much of its heat in the form of radiation (radiation is direclty proportional to the temperature difference) this will cause perception of cold and the body starts shivering even though no actual heat loss has occured from the core body thermal load (only skin looses heat, not the body core). The brain anticipates that the core will loose its heat when exposed to such low temperature for prolonged periods and starts the warming mechanism <strong>before<\/strong> the actual cooling occurs such that the cooling is <strong>either prevented or minimized<\/strong>. This is called <strong>Anticipatory control<\/strong> and the temperature of skin being close to the ambient temperature within physiological limits is needed for this.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Skin is the medium (almost the only medium) through which the excessive heat produced by the body core during activity is expelled.
