The circulatory system carries fluids, the nervous system electrical signals so they are functionally not alike. However, both systems run throughout the body and have a more or less central control unit (the brain and heart respectively). So there is a structural similarity. I reckon they are as much alike as a city's sewer system and electricity grid.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>I understand we have neurons (please correct me if I am wrong) all over the surface of body.<\/em><br>\n<strong>That is correct<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>Whenever we feel a touch (stimulus arises) a neuron fires a response, and that response travels through axons (myelin sheath).<\/em><br>\n<strong>Tactile stimulation may result in firing of one or more neurons<\/strong>, dependent on the intensity of the stimulus. Larger stimuli will, obviously, recruit more fibers. Stronger stimuli will evoke stronger responses (increased firing). <strong>Axons indeed conduct the neuronal responses<\/strong>, like an electrical wire conducts electrical current. Longer axons are often myelinated (insulated). Not all neurons related to touch are myelinated, however. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>So my main question is that what exactly is a nerve?<\/em><br>\n<strong>A nerve is a bundle of axons<\/strong> that carry related functional information. Typically, nerves conduct information originating from locations closely located together in the body, and generally they convey this information to a localized spot in the body as well. For example, the optic nerve carries information from the photoreceptors (related information) from the retina (localized source) to the brainstem (localized target).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><em>Is [a nerve] a long axon?<\/em><br>\n<strong>A nerve contains many axons<\/strong>.

It is the afferent activity in the peripheral and central nervous systems produced by stimulation of specialized free nerve endings called nociceptors or \"pain receptors\" that only respond to tissue damage caused by intense chemical (e.g., chilli powder in the eyes), mechanical (e.g., pinching, crushing) or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation.[2][3] Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a signal along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of autonomic responses and may also result in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings.[3] Nociceptive neurons generate trains of action potentials in response to intense stimuli, and the frequency of firing determines the intensity of the pain.[4]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From the wiki: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Now when you consider a knife, the surface area of the knife is small enough that it can cause damage. It's akin to holding a plastic sheet stretched tight and then piercing the sheet with the point of a knife. That is because the force is being transferred on a small point and hence easily extends the pain threshold.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, when you consider a hammer, when the hammer touches you (lightly) you don't feel the pain because the force is spread over the larger surface area of the hammer and hence doesn't meet the threshold. However, if you hammer your finger in with force, the force being transferred is enough to shatter your bones, and in that case not only the cutaneous pain receptors activate, but the somatic receptors also activate, causing the feeling of pain.<\/p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Knife has short surface area, and hence force transfer is over a small area, subsequently causing hurt. A hammer has a larger surface area, and hence unless more force is applied, the pain receptor threshold is not met and hence no pain.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37386,"question_id":37361,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37361/how-is-pain-induced-by-blunt-and-sharp-objects","last_activity_date":1457643485,"creation_date":1440966213,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is pain induced by blunt and sharp objects?","body":"<p>Normally, when something touch you, you won't feel pain.

To answer your question, you would need to know what tracts are being severed and what sensations each tract is responsible for. A clean R hemi-section of the spinal cord at the level of T6 would affect the 1) R lateral corticospinal tract, 2) R spinothalamic tract, and 3) R dorsal columns. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The R lateral corticopsinal tract is an upper motor neuron (UMN) pathway, which relays messages from your brain to the periphery. If severed, it would lead to paralysis of muscles below the lesion on the ipsilateral side. This would result in UMN signs such as increased reflexes, increased spasticity, and muscle weakness. <\/li>\n<li>The spinothalamic tract is a sensory pathway connecting peripheral sensations and bringing them up to the brain. Specifically, it communicates sensations of pain, temperature, and gross touch. If severed on the R side, these sensations would be lost on the contralateral side a few levels below the site of the lesion. The reason for this is due to the decussation, or crossing over, of the tract at or slightly above the level of entry of the nerve fibers into the spinal cord from the periphery. <\/li>\n<li>The dorsal columns are similar to the spinothalamic tract, except the sensations communicated are vibration, fine touch, and proprioception. If severed, this would cause loss of these sensations below the level of the lesion but on the same side. A patient would not be able to balance himself/herself without support. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Regarding what areas of the body would be affected based on a lesion in T6, C1, or L5, just as mentioned by jonsca, one would need a dermatome to understand what areas of skin sensation would be affected, and know the nerve root origins of different nerves of muscles.

Just remember that it's electricity. When you have any sort of cut or damage, your body recruits white blood cells which protect you from any bacteria that might enter. They also cause inflammation to prevent those bacteria from spreading (and to warn other cells that they may become infected). It is also important that we feel pain, so we know something is wrong (because we have the ability to do something about it). That's why inflammation causes pain. It does this by lowering our threshold so our nerves are more sensitive. In other words, it takes less damage, pressure etc. to cause our nerves to send the pain signal. Normally, it is set higher, so we don't suffer too much pain.

First of all, as with most neurologic complaints, you must determine what the patient means by \u201cnumbness.\u201d Some patients are describing loss of sensitivity (anesthesia or hypesthesia) or distorted sensations (paresthesia), which is often described as tingling. Actual loss of sensitivity is more likely to represent true damage to sensory pathways in the nervous system, while paresthesia has a much broader differential. Dysesthesia, that is the perception of an unpleasant (often burning) sensation or allodynia (the perception of innocuous stimuli as being painful) may result from damage to the nervous system or, more commonly, be the manifestation of an underlying painful condition.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Some properties of numbness <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The pattern of numbness may help define its origin. Numbness confined to a specific nerve or nerve root distribution (see the maps of dermatomes and peripheral nerve sensory innervation) lead to consideration of peripheral nerve or nerve root damage. Loss of sensation on one side of the body is more likely to result from central nervous system damage and if the sensory loss also involves the same side of the face, you can be sure that the cause is located above the level of the pons.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>When there is a clear sensory level (a line on the body, below which sensations are lost), a spinal cord lesion must be suspected. Loss of sensation over the upper limbs or upper part of the trunk bilaterally, with preservation over the lower limbs and buttocks, suggests an expanding intraspinal mass. This so-called \u201csacral sparing\u201d is seen with intraspinal tumors or syrinxes. Numbness over one side of the face, while being a relatively common presentation of psychiatric disease, can also be caused by damage to the lateral part of the brain stem, or upper spinal cord (spinal tract of the trigeminal). Lateral brain stem damage can also produce a picture of sensory decrease on one side of the head and on the opposite side of the body.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But the article concludes <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In summary, the evaluation of numbness can be quite frustrating due to its subjective nature. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So it is in essence a term that <em>can<\/em> have specific meanings uncertain contexts, but one must be careful to clarify exactly how the term is being used since there isn't one single meaning. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is all from this link here \n<a href=\"https://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_13.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_13.html<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":36233,"question_id":36213,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12086f42e1380495f6b35592ce60b0e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11652,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11652/stan-shunpike","reputation":819,"display_name":"Stan Shunpike","accept_rate":70},"score":0,"post_id":36518,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438372001,"comment_id":60771,"body":"This is much more what I had in mind.

One of them is the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9703.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>hair follicle receptor<\/strong><\/a>. These receptors form sensory nerve fibers that wrap around each hair bulb.

A rough classification of the various skin receptors is grouping them in <strong>rapidly<\/strong> and <strong>slowly adapting<\/strong> fibers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rapidly adapting fibers respond mainly to <strong>pressure changes<\/strong>. Typical examples are the Pacinian and Meissner's corpuscles, but also the hair follicle receptor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fig. 1. shows a <strong>static stimulation<\/strong> of the various receptors. Upon initial stimulation, the hair follicle receptor (Fig. 1a) vigorously fires action potentials. Because the hair follicle receptor rapidly adapts, however, it soon stops responding when the hair is continuously, statically bent in that same direction. Once the stimulus is removed it fires another volley of action potentials because the hair moves again.<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, the hair follicle receptor responds to strokes, stretch and skin vibrations, as it is a novelty detector; it detects <strong>change<\/strong>, just like Pacinian and Meissner's corpuscles do (Fig. 1b,c). This opposed to Merkel cells and Ruffini endings (Fig.1d,e) - these receptors are designed to continuously fire action potentials upon a static pressure stimulus (Fig. 1), although even these receptors eventually give up and become unresponsive.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/beyQC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/beyQC.jpg\" alt=\"skin receptors\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

Crocodiles have fixed jaws, meaning that they have lost the mechanism used to move their lower jaw from side to side. This simplification means that they can exert a huge amount of power, making it a great adaptation for their particular strategy of hiding in water and ambushing large land mammals that drink from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, it also means that it's very hard for them to adapt to any other niche. Anything that would require eating smaller prey, or eating on land, would be untenable, because crocodiles can't chew. (Instead they close their mouth and rotate their whole body in the water to rip chunks of flesh off.) They can't easily re-evolve the ability to chew, because the mechanism needed to do that is pretty complicated, so their fixed jaw is more or less \"locked in\" evolutionarily.<\/p>\n\n<p>So crocodiles have remained constant because they are very well adapted to a particular niche; because they've lost features that would allow them to adapt to other niches; and because the niche they occupy has been around for a very long time. <\/p>\n\n<p>Personally I think these are the primary reasons. The low mutation rate mentioned in the other answers seems to me more likely to be effect than cause. If you are very tightly adapted to a particular niche then there is less advantage in genetically exploring other possibilities, so the descendants of individuals with lower mutation rates would have an advantage over those with higher mutation rates. This would provide an evolutionary pressure for a low mutation rate, which might explain the observation. (But this last paragraph is speculation on my part. I work on modelling evolution and I know that this kind of selection on mutation rates can occur, but I have no evidence at all about whether it happens in crocodiles.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":43738,"question_id":43695,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/491ae9d5efb1f910af91609c2526d3c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":22181,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22181/user22181","reputation":39,"display_name":"user22181"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":1,"post_id":43741,"edited":false,"creation_date":1456564514,"comment_id":75781,"body":"Welcome to Bio.

A crocodile won't benefit from a Darwinian advantage if it doesn't provide enough of a survival advantage to eventually fuel a divergent evolution.

In 2012 Genbank contained over 3x10<sup>11<\/sup> nucleotides in approx 10<sup>9<\/sup> sequences. So it is not feasible to do a rigorous comparison of the query sequence with each of the target sequences in the database, e.g. by the dynamic programming method, either local or global. It would just take too long. Instead BLAST uses heuristics to get the most likely best matches in a reasonable time.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key assumptions of one of the heurists used is that any good overall match between sequences will contain some high-quality short matches, called high-scoring pairs (HSPs). (HSPs would be perfect matches of short runs of nucleotides, or high-score matches of amino acids (tripeptides) when one uses an amino acid comparison scoring matrix.) The program can make an index or library of those HSPs present in the query sequence and then just compare these (i.e. make a local alignment) in turn with target database sequences \u2014 a great time saving. So that is the basic answer to the first part of your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just to quickly complete the story, an attempt is then made to use these high scoring pairs as 'seeds' to extend the alignment in either direction, and high scoring target sequences are saved and ranked.<\/p>\n\n<p>An answer to your second question is you would do a global alignment when you were working with just a couple of sequences and had some scientific reason to believe that they were related, even though there were regions that had diverged appreciably. For example, you might be aware of key rare amino acids or nucleotide sequence motifs that should align in these regions and want to display them. Or you might want to align a protein of unknown three-dimensional structure with a related one of known structure to model it.

The part that is missing is that protein kinase C isn't just one enzyme, but perhaps a dozen different isoforms that fall into three different classes, differing, among other things in their requirements for activation (e.g. whether they require calcium ions as well as diacylglycerol). It would be theoretically possible for protein kinase C activated by one pathway to have different effects from that activated by another if the different isoforms involved had different properties. This has indeed been suggested, although it has been difficult to establish experimentally.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following two reviews that deal with this are about 20 years old, but may allow easier general access (and are easier to read):<\/p>\n\n<p>Dekker, L.V. and Parker, P.J. (1994) Trends in Biochemical Sciences vol 19 pp 73\u201377.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jaken, S. (1996) Current Opinion in Cell Biology, vol 8, pp 168\u2013173.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following quotation from the summary of a more recent and more extensive review article (Steinberg, S.F. [2008] Physiol. Review. vol. 88 pp. 1341\u20131378) may be pertinent:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"There is growing evidence that individual PKC isoforms subserve unique (and in some cases opposing) functions in cells, at least in part as a result of isoform-specific subcellular compartmentalization patterns, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications that influence catalytic function.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>One other feature of protein kinase C is relevant to this question. Most other protein kinases (which tend not to have multiple isoforms) have a more or less restricted substrate specificity determined by residues of a particular type at particular positions with respect to the phosphorylation target residue (Ser, Thr or Tyr). This limits the proteins the kinases act on to specific targets. In contrast, protein kinase C can phosphorylate target residues in a wide variety of contexts. The current model (above) allows specificity of protein kinase C for target proteins to be obtained in a different way \u2014 by the specific proteins that each activated isoform binds to, i.e. by protein\u2013protein interaction rather than target-site context.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44054,"question_id":44025,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1457530434}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44025/why-does-protein-kinase-c-activated-by-different-means-have-different-effects","last_activity_date":1457535242,"creation_date":1457322164,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does protein kinase C activated by different means have different effects?","body":"<p>I could be way off base but I think I remember learning that Protein Kinase C has some effects when activated by one pathway and other effects when activated by another.

It is likely that there is no single active compound and that valerian's effects result from multiple constituents acting independently or synergistically [18, reviewed in 19].<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Two categories of constituents have been proposed as the major source of valerian's sedative effects. The first category comprises the major constituents of its volatile oil including valerenic acid and its derivatives, which have demonstrated sedative properties in animal studies [6,20]. However, valerian extracts with very little of these components also have sedative properties, making it probable that other components are responsible for these effects or that multiple constituents contribute to them [21]. The second category comprises the iridoids, which include the valepotriates. Valepotriates and their derivatives are active as sedatives in vivo but are unstable and break down during storage or in an aqueous environment, making their activity difficult to assess [6,20,22].<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A possible mechanism by which a valerian extract may cause sedation is by increasing the amount of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter) available in the synaptic cleft. Results from an in vitro study using synaptosomes suggest that a valerian extract may cause GABA to be released from brain nerve endings and then block GABA from being taken back into nerve cells [23]. In addition, valerenic acid inhibits an enzyme that destroys GABA [reviewed in 24]. Valerian extracts contain GABA in quantities sufficient to cause a sedative effect, but whether GABA can cross the blood-brain barrier to contribute to valerian's sedative effects is not known. Glutamine is present in aqueous but not in alcohol extracts and may cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted to GABA [25]. Levels of these constituents vary significantly among plants depending on when the plants are harvested, resulting in marked variability in the amounts found in valerian preparations [26].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Quoting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_(herb)#Valerian_extract\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because of valerian's historical use as a sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, and pain reliever, most basic science research has been directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor.[16] Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally are believed to have some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act.[17][18] Valeric acid, which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older valerian roots, does not have any sedative properties. Valeric acid is related to valproic acid, a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; valproic acid is a derivative of valeric acid.[citation needed]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Valerian also contains isovaltrate, which has been shown to be an inverse agonist for adenosine A1 receptor sites. This action likely does not contribute to the herb's possible sedative effects, which would be expected from an agonist, rather than an inverse agonist, at this particular binding site. Hydrophilic extractions of the herb commonly sold over the counter, however, probably do not contain significant amounts of isovaltrate.[19] Valerenic acid in valerian stimulates serotonin receptors as a partial agonist.[20]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":44108,"question_id":44107,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1457517440,"creation_date":1457514141,"body":"<p><strong>Short answer<\/strong><br>\nValerian preparations contain many compounds, but it is not known which may be responsible for its sedative effects.

So it seems that blue is dominant in those cases. But when you cross those colors against each other, you get silly nonsense, a 3:1.2:1 ratio or something. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, based on the linked answers, you are justified in thinking that genetics determines flower color, just because of the simple Mendelian pattern of the first 2 crosses.

You say: \"I was thinking blue (BB) was the dominant epistatic flower color allele\u2014BB or Bb would give blue regardless of the other color allele, and bb would allow the expression of color dictated by the other gene...\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But look at the parents and offspring of the third cross. You say blue is dominant- but it is in fact expressed in the offspring of non-blue parents! So blue can't both be dominant and be the \"controlling\" epistatic gene.

My answer is working from that assumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>The big difference between naturally occurring \"parasitic\" genetic elements (including bacterial CRISPR elements and things like transposons) and the gene drives that are being tested as vector control revolves around what we put inside the latter class of gene drive. <\/p>\n\n<p>The OP hit on this difference in his question, when he mentioned the decrease in fitness caused by engineered drives. In the naturally occurring drive-like elements, there is rarely ever a decrease in fitness in the organism and when it does occur, it is unlikely to be passed on to future generations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Transposons, for instance, are largely active in somatic cells, whose DNA is not passed on to descendants. Semi-randomly occurring genetic changes are sometimes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4107273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">passed on<\/a>, but this is relatively rare and evolution favors those that are either neutral or that increase fitness. A brief search doesn't turn up, and I can't think of, any cases of naturally occurring deleterious genetic alterations caused by something like a transposon having been found to remain in a population long enough to be studied. <\/p>\n\n<p>Engineered gene drives, on the other hand, particularly in the cases of those meant to combat mosquitos, are purposefully designed to reduce the fitness of their target host. <\/p>\n\n<p>The last question, of what keeps naturally occurring drives at low levels, requires either a rather vague, or a very long answer. I'll go with vague and provide some links to longer ones. Briefly, our genomes have evolved a lot of ways to maintain genomic integrity, in the forms of proteins responsible for proof-reading DNA, repairing breaks, and destroying any \"free\" pieces of DNA found outside of a chromosome.

So in the hair example in the comments above, there are probably a good number of dead cells hanging onto the hair, enough for analysis. Meiosis will redistribute the DNA sequences inherited from mom and dad randomly, so each sperm is in theory a unique patchwork of that person's genome, but overall the genome will be covered well. Single-cell work, on the other hand, is technically very challenging.<\/p>\n\n<p>[edit: <a href=\"http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(11)00043-3/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> is an article describing methods for low-input analysis of forensic samples. Unfortunately paywalled.]<\/p>\n\n<p>To directly answer the OP on uniqueness: absolutely a single sperm is that unique for each person, in principle. There are lots and lots of genetic variants in each human, and everyone represents a unique mix. It is estimated that 1/1000 places in the genome of each person differ from any other person, on average (for substitutions). there are 3*10^9 places in the genome for this to be the case, which gives you a very large number of differences, ASSUMING that you can actually ascertain all those differences. [edit: for a discussion of these stats see <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.]<\/p>\n\n<p>The technical problem with forensics is that often they only look at a few places in the genome (microsatellites usually), because it is relatively expensive and hard even with recent technology to look at more than that in any detail. This leads to the non-trivial possibility of misidentification with the standard battery of loci. This possibility never goes away entirely, but it becomes very small with more data. I am not a forensic scientist, possibly they have gotten more comprehensive or the methods have changed in recent times.<\/p>\n\n<p>[edit: <a href=\"http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:309703/FULLTEXT01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> is a document that has what appears to be a readable introduction to DNA forensics, including technical discussions of some drawbacks of marker panels used by for instance the FBI of the USA.]<\/p>\n","answer_id":44062,"question_id":44010,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1457417672}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44010/if-sperm-contains-only-50-of-someones-dna-how-can-it-be-used-to-identify-someo","last_activity_date":1457417672,"creation_date":1457279294,"answer_count":2,"title":"if sperm contains only 50% of someone's DNA how can it be used to identify someone?","body":"<p>Is DNA so unique that 50% of it is enough to identify a single person?<\/p>\n","question_id":44010,"tags":["dna","reproduction"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":129,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3af87f6b1d4d247d01ce3b73d918fc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3535/nic","reputation":265,"display_name":"nic"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxfyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3059/dd3","reputation":2303,"display_name":"dd3","accept_rate":95},"score":0,"post_id":8272,"edited":false,"creation_date":1368081557,"comment_id":10473,"body":"I think two things might be the issue: 1) lack of atmospheric oxygen and 2) the dust."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3af87f6b1d4d247d01ce3b73d918fc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3535,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3535/nic","reputation":265,"display_name":"nic"},"score":0,"post_id":8272,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxfyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3059/dd3","reputation":2303,"display_name":"dd3","accept_rate":95},"edited":false,"creation_date":1368083649,"comment_id":10474,"body":"@dd3: Don&#39;t hesitate to propose an answer around this :-)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwCAc.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3393,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3393/rhysw","reputation":143,"display_name":"RhysW"},"score":0,"post_id":8272,"edited":false,"creation_date":1368098558,"comment_id":10476,"body":"Frost Burns are likely to be the real killer here.

Here are some:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You will explode.<\/strong> This is just ridiculous. The skin is air tight (relatively speaking). It is also very elastic and can pull and bend quite a great deal before tearing. Through quite a few, equally durable, tissues, it is connected to the bones, which are unaffected by negative air pressure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your blood will boil.<\/strong> The circulatory system is also a closed system. It is not directly exposed to the environment. Also, the blood pressure in a healthy person is averaged around 100 mmHg and Earth's atmosphere at sea level is 700 mmHg. There is already a massive disparity, yet Earth's atmosphere doesn't go pouring into our veins at random. Likewise, the blood in a person's veins won't go pouring out into the atmosphere simply because the pressure is extremely low.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Any air in your lungs will be forcibly sucked out of you.<\/strong> Again, this is a closed system, if you hold your breath. As long as you don't try to breathe there is nothing forcing the air from your lungs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your eyes will be sucked from their sockets<\/strong>. Thank you <em>Total Recall<\/em> (the original) for this myth. The eyes are very firmly in place. You might feel a pull on them, but they aren't going anywhere.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Absolutely none of these would happen in the vacuum of space and certainly not on the Martian surface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h2>Here's what <em>will<\/em> happen:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Any liquid material on the surface of your body will vaporize. All sweat, saliva (if you open your mouth), water in the mucous, and tears on the eyes, will nearly instantly vaporize. It would be quite uncomfortable, especially the eyes, but very survivable. Long term exposure to a vacuum might damage the eyes eventually, but in this scenario there are far more pressing matters.<\/p>\n\n<p>The negative pressure may also cause your eardrums to rupture. Try to imagine the feeling your ears get on the plane at 30 thousand feet times about 100. Since you can't close your ears, plugging them with your fingers may help, but likely just postpone the inevitable pressure disparity, which will lead to at least great discomfort and possible drum rupture.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you had the chance, you should take a deep breath before jumping out and avoid trying to breathe at all costs. Opening your lungs for a breath would very quickly draw whatever breath you had in them out into the atmosphere and also vaporize any fluid that was in them. Considering the rapid pace of this event, you would surely have permanent damage from this and begin suffocating and will die in a minute or two unless you get medical attention. There seems to be conflict in the procedure for this, with some sources suggesting that emptying your lungs would be better to avoid this. Considering the astronaut in your example is about to do a 200 meter dash he is going to need all the O<sub>2<\/sub> he can get.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cold is also a treacherous factor. At -50C the heat from your body would dissipate so rapidly that it would likely be very debilitating, perhaps causing you to seize up and clutch your extremities to your chest. It would also be excruciatingly painful. It might cause you to fall into shock. In a total vacuum however, this does not exist. A vacuum is actually very insulating, but on Mars' what little atmosphere is there is enough for you to feel the chill.<\/p>\n\n<p>The lack of oxygen and high CO<sub>2<\/sub> would be what would eventually kill you. You would eventually try to breathe and loose consciousness within a breath or two (or you might loose consciousness first then your body would try to breathe naturally). Your body would try to keep you alive as long as possible by pumping your heart faster and increasing your blood pressure, but your heart would eventually fail and you would die within seconds after that.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Evaluating your particular scenario<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are first a few things about the scenario that seem unlikely.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The astronaut would not be naked. They remain in some of their protective gear in case of emergencies like this. He would have some protection against the cold if he had to run out without it.<\/li>\n<li>Certain things like extinguishers are always nearby. The idea that one was unreachable is a little silly.<\/li>\n<li>Space vehicles, shuttles, and buildings all are compartmentalized like a submarine. They could simply close off the affected areas.<\/li>\n<li>Fire only burns in the presence of oxygen (with few exceptions). After being closed off, compartments can be decompressed, halting the fire immediately. They can then begin refilling them with breathable atmosphere. This poses the same vacuum problem if the astronaut is in the affected area, but he won't be trying to run across the surface naked. People have survived rapid decompressions before without a single injury, as listed in my second source, however, others have never regained consciousness.<\/li>\n<li>Assuming you made it to the other building, they usually only open from the inside. So unless someone saw you coming and opened the door for you, your last minutes would be better spent desperately fighting the fire until it consumed you rather than banging on the neighbor's door.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>But let's say all of this breaks down and poor Astronaut Joe finds himself making a mad, streaker's dash across the Martian surface.<\/p>\n\n<p>We should assume that our astronaut is both quite athletic and knowledgeable about the environment outside of his shelter, knowing that he should take a deep breath before heading out, but literally has no time to grab a shirt, goggles, breathing mask, or anything. Just him and Mars.<\/p>\n\n<p>If he's lucky, it's not too cold and he doesn't seize up and fall into the fetal position within a few steps. Let's say it's -20C, which is pretty darn cold, but tolerable for a minute or two. I next see him flailing across the surface, trying to run in Mars' low gravity (no easy task). He begins to loose vision as a cloud of steam of what should be tears pours from his dry eyes. His eyelids then begin to stick to his eyeballs because there is no longer any lubrication. He is desperate to reach the other building, and his movements get more and more erratic, as his body is rapidly using all of the available oxygen. All the while, he is still holding his breath, knowing that if he attempts to breathe he will likely collapse within seconds and perish. But the more he struggles to make it, the more his innate urge to breathe overpowers his conscious thought to prevent it.

For among-population divergence, Fst (fixation index) is also commonly used. But if you are using a sequence alignment or some such data to compute genetic distances, there are lots and lots of metrics. Some of them are very simple- for instance you could use Hamming distance and just count the number of residue differences between each sequence. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for computing these metrics, there is a webserver called GenePop online that will compute Fst for you if you plug in a dataset. I don't know of R packages that compute these things, I would guess just by looking at wikipedia that coding functions to do this would be relatively trivial (if you are comfortable with r).<\/p>\n\n<p>2) If you are truly looking among species, a somewhat more appropriate approach might be to model your species in a phylogeny, rather than to use distance methods (though the two are attempting to solve sort of the same problem). There are lots of easy-to-use online programs for this, for instance: <a href=\"http://fastml.tau.ac.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FastML<\/a>. You can just copy-and-paste a seq alignment in there. After you have the tree in for instance newick format, there are good tools for visualizing trees both online at iTOL, and through R with <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">APE<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>APE also has good utilities for modeling phylogenetic processes, so you could in principle directly model changes in protein folds through evolutionary time (assuming you have a meaningful summary of protein folding, either continuous or discrete).<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't have enough reputation to link to more of the resources I mentioned, sorry.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44061,"question_id":44052,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1457381945}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44052/how-do-i-measure-genetic-distance","last_activity_date":1457381945,"creation_date":1457369106,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do I measure genetic distance?","body":"<p>I'm not sure how to measure genetic distance.

After giving it more thought, I've expanded the list to four reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. SUBSTRATE<\/strong> - Burrowing animals are far less diverse than animals that live aboveground; note the remarkable similarity between moles, golden moles and marsupial moles - all unrelated. The obvious reason is that they're adapted to living in soil. Roots are similarly constrained by their environment. It's hard to imagine a giant palm leaf growing underground.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. UNIFORM ENVIRONMENT<\/strong> - Leaves experience light and dark, daily temperature fluctuations and even greater seasonal fluctuations. They may be pummeled by high winds, hail and fire. These variables may influence leaf evolution in many different ways. In contrast, roots grow in an environment that is always dark, relatively protected from wind, hail and fire and relatively stable temperature wise.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. FUNCTION<\/strong> - Aside from anchoring plants, roots' primary function is transporting water and nutrients. The optimum shape for this is round, similar to the veins in our bodies and the plumbing in people's homes. Rectangular roots or roots shaped like maple leaves make no sense.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. PREDATORS<\/strong> - A wide variety of animals feed on leaves, which may evolve defenses against predation. For example, a cactus' spines are modified leaves that are widely believed to serve as defenses against animals in search of a juicy cactus. In contrast, relatively few animals feed on roots. There are a few species that dig for roots, and some burrowing animals feed on roots, but virtually no wild primates or ungulates feed on roots.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, leaves grow in an environment where they are less constrained and less protected by the surrounding substrate and are exposed to a far greater variety of environmental variables and predators.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as color goes, I don't see much difference; most roots are whitish or brownish, while most leaves are green. Of course, leaves of some species do change colors in the fall, when temperatures begin to decrease. But, once again, roots are relatively insulated from the cold, especially if the ground is covered with a blanket of snow.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41796,"question_id":41795,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1451259928}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41795/why-arent-plants-roots-as-diverse-as-leaves","last_activity_date":1457345783,"creation_date":1451186713,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why aren't plants' roots as diverse as leaves?","body":"<p>I have been doing some gardening recently and I suddenly realised that all plants have superficially identical non-woody roots of the same size from gigantic trees to small fruiting plants and vegetables.

Presumably this is why this question has not been answered previously. However I think it worth providing a summary answer in order to stress something that I feel perhaps does not receive enough emphasis in texts, and is ignored in the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is that the regulation of glycogen metabolism (and indeed other aspects of carbohydrate metabolism) differs in different tissues because of the different situations in which its synthesis and breakdown is appropriate in relation to the integrated metabolism of the organism. If we just consider skeletal muscle and liver, the muscle stores glycogen to use <em>itself<\/em> when it needs to generate ATP to power contraction, whereas the liver stores glycogen so that it can provide <em>other tissues<\/em> with glucose when they require it either for work (e.g. the skeletal muscle) or in starvation (e.g. erythrocytes and brain).<\/p>\n\n<p>The appropriate integration is provided in the first instance by the hormones mentioned (so-called first messengers), and the presence or absence of receptors in the tissues so that they will respond to these hormones or be refractory towards them, as appropriate. <\/p>\n\n<p>Both liver and skeletal muscle have receptors for epinephrine (adrenaline) which is secreted as a stress response. This results in the breakdown of glycogen \u2014 used internally by the skeletal muscle and released as glucose by the liver, as already mentioned.<\/p>\n\n<p>Liver also has receptors for glucagon, the hormone which is secreted in starvation or fasting, and also causes the breakdown of glycogen. The skeletal muscle does not have glucagon receptors because the nutritional state is irrelevant to its energy requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both liver and skeletal muscle have receptors for insulin, the hormone of the fed state, and respond to this by increasing the synthesis of glycogen to build up supplies to be available when needed. <\/p>\n\n<p>How do these hormones work? <\/p>\n\n<p>Glucagon and epinephrine (adrenaline) both work by activating adenyl cyclase (a so-called second messenger) in a G-protein-coupled manner to generate cyclic-AMP. This acts by a phosphorylation cascade to activate glycogen phosphorylase and inhibit glycogen synthase as described in any standard text. (Protein phosphatase 1 is also involved.) Glycogen breakdown is this enhanced.<\/p>\n\n<p>Insulin acts differently. Binding to its receptor activates the protein's intrinsic tyrosine kinase, and there is a chain of subsequent protein self-phosphorylations culminating in the phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1. This causes it to dephosphorylate both glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase leading to the activation of the former and the inactivation of the latter. Glycogen synthesis is thus enhanced.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of metabolic control, but it is also important to see them in the context of integrated tissue metabolism. So I will end with a question for the reader. The brain (which is absolutely dependent on glucose for part of its metabolism) stores a small amount of glycogen. How would you expect the brain to respond to the three hormones mentioned, and what would you expect to be the fate of the product of glycogen breakdown? If you have understood the principles above for liver and muscle you should be able to make rational predictions for brain (even should the facts turn out to be more complex).<\/p>\n","answer_id":44023,"question_id":40214,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40214/how-is-the-enzyme-glycogen-synthase-regulated","last_activity_date":1457301954,"creation_date":1446501080,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is the enzyme glycogen synthase regulated?","body":"<p>How is the enzyme glycogen synthase regulated in regards to glycogen synthesis?
