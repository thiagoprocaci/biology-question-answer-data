Wikipedia states: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reverse engineering is the process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object, or system through analysis of its structure, function, and operation. It often involves taking apart something (a mechanical device, electronic component, computer program, or biological, chemical, or organic matter) and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or simply duplicating (without understanding) the original.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>How else are you suppose to study something? Anything?<\/p>\n\n<p>I dont want to answer a question with a question so I will continue. If you are working with a complex system, you will need to study the individual pieces. Although it is helpful to sometimes to look at the system of a whole, doing that introduces many variables that makes it impossible to tell what is really going on. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some will say you need to do this because biological systems are so complex and that this is 'evidence' for a creator. That is silly. I can agree that biological systems are complex, but that is not evidence for a creator. Complexity is not a good thing. I think sometimes people have a naive view of a cell that it is organized and everything works perfectly and there is precision in everything (or even a lot of things). But thats not true. It is messy. Cells are chaotic. They are a freshman's dorm room. I study splicing, a very complex process.  And I just read a paper where they looked at highly conserved transcripts with no known alternative isoforms. And what did they find? <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/29/0813128106\">They found that in small amounts every exon was being spliced incorrectly.<\/a> Sure, most of the time it was spliced correctly. They even called it high fidelity. But the gene they looked at had 5 exons. Consider that the largest gene in humans has over 300 exons, and if all of those are being spliced incorrectly, it adds up. If an exon is misspliced 1/1000 times, and you have 300 exons, that means 1/3 of your transcripts are not what you want. It adds up to a lot of wasted effort by the cell, and it certainly would be better if there was no splicing (or at least less) for large genes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thats just one example but you could literally pick any component of the cell and find inefficiency. Sure, 1/1000th is good accuracy fot splicing, but lets have some context. Since we are talking about designers, does anyone here use a watch (designed by mere mortals) that stops working one minute out of every thousand? A computer that shuts down randomly one minute of every thousand? Me either.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is 'reverse engineering' evidence of a designer? No, its evidence that cells are a mess and we need to separate the noise from whatever it is we want to study.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":10150,"question_id":10146,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1377960881,"creation_date":1377960881,"body":"<p>No. If I wanted to study the sun, I might build a space ship to take me there.

If you find it, highlight it in both the sequence it came from and the gene-of-interest so that you know you have already matched them.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Carry on with adjacent bases for the forward strand. Repeat for the reverse complement of the reverse strand.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>Semi-Automated Method:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Go to <a href=\"http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCBI Blast<\/a>, and under the heading <strong>Basic Blast<\/strong>, click \"nucleotide blast\".<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Check \"Align 2 or more sequences.\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enter your <strong>Query Sequence<\/strong> as your 1000 bp sequences, entered in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blastcgihelp.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">FASTA format<\/a>. FASTA format will allow you to enter multiple sequences, but if you just enter one at a time, that will work perfectly well. Results will only display one at a time anyway.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; sequence name here\nATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG....\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Enter your gene of interest as your <strong>Subject Sequence<\/strong>. Format does not matter here, but for consistency, I use FASTA format.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Keep \"Highly similar sequences (megablast)\" selected. You shouldn't need to play with these parameters, they just change how the alignment method penalizes alignments for gaps and mismatches.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hit <strong>BLAST<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Interpret your results. I've included an example of BLAST results below.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmzGs.png\" alt=\"BLAST example output aligning two sequences.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>At the top of this window is a schematic, showing exactly how much of the the query sequence aligns with the subject sequence. The longer the line, the more bases align. Similarly, the closer the colour of the line is to right of the scale (e.g., red), then the more continuous the segment is indicating a longer, continuous alignment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Below the graphic is a table of results. Briefly, the table highlights all possible alignments that the BLAST algorithm has found, including how much coverage there was, confidence of the alignment and length of alignment coverage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Below the results table, are the detailed results which were summarized in the table. This detailed report shows you exactly which bases align or mismatch, or any gaps. The top line is the subject sequence; the bottom is the query sequence. The other thing to keep in mind here is the <strong>Strand<\/strong> line. In this case, it says \"<strong>Plus/Plus<\/strong>, meaning that the aligned sequences were the forward sense, or plus strand, of each of subject and query sequence, respectively. If you entered a reverse complement sequence instead (such as the reverse sequencing results) then this would change to <strong>\"Plus/Minus\"<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>From here, you will still need to manually line these results up to your gene of interest to determine exactly which portion of the gene is missing sequence coverage, as well as any mutations that may have cropped up in the cloning process.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5280,"question_id":5267,"up_vote_count":4,"community_owned_date":1353454960},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb985c1850d3eda0f9dbf105cb848a66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4033,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4033/vrume21","reputation":121,"display_name":"vrume21"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":9316,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377868000,"comment_id":13327,"body":"this answer may be a bit sparse, but these are the most typical solutions to the question"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1374110430,"creation_date":1374108382,"body":"<p>Multiple sequence alignment is a common bioinformatics problem and there are many tools available to solve it.<br>\nThis paper provides a good comparison of the following tools: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018093\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thompson, et al.

Wiki has a fairly comprehensive coverage on the topic so,I'll use a few of the wikipedia examples to explain how the pigmentation and scattering of light interact to give colours:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Blue eye colour<\/strong> is the result of pigment in low concentration and Rayleigh scattering (or Tyndall effect) of the short <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aEM_spectrum.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">light wavelengths (blue is short, red is long)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"There is no blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the ocular\n  fluid. Dissection reveals that the iris pigment epithelium is brownish\n  black due to the presence of melanin. Unlike brown eyes, blue eyes\n  have low concentrations of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which\n  lies in front of the dark epithelium. Longer wavelengths of light tend\n  to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium, while shorter\n  wavelengths are reflected and undergo Rayleigh scattering in the\n  turbid medium of the stroma. This is the same frequency-dependence\n  of scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky.\n  The result is a \"Tyndall blue\" structural color that varies with\n  external lighting conditions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Brown eyes<\/strong> are the result of higher melanin concentrations which absorbs more of the light, reducing the amount of light being reflected.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In humans, brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of\n  melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter\n  and longer wavelengths to be absorbed.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Green eyes<\/strong> appear to be mid-ground between blue and brown, they have more pigment than blue but less than brown.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"As in the case of blue eyes, the color of green eyes does not result\n  simply from the pigmentation of the iris. Rather, its appearance is\n  caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of\n  the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with\n  the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected\n  light.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>More can be read on this in these two studies: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778410\" rel=\"nofollow\">study 1<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0749.2005.00268.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">study 2<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Rayleigh scattering / the Tyndall effect and why do they turn eyes blue?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I shall refer to this as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tyndall effect<\/a> but in the literature both Rayleigh and Tyndall are used because they are apparently very similar though Tyndall occurs with much larger particles. The Tyndall effect is caused by the variable scattering of light by particles depending on the wavelength of the light and relative size of the particles. Shorter wavelength lights are scattered more than the longer ones (so more red light is absorb than blue) which means more blue light is reflected. When more melanin is present in the iris it will better absorb the short wavelength light than when there is little melanin, therefore, people with low melanin levels appear to have blue eyes.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"An analogy to this wavelength dependency is that longwave electromagnetic waves such as radio waves are able to pass through the walls of buildings, while shortwave electromagnetic waves such as light waves are stopped and reflected by the walls.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Why do eye colours change?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Again, wikipedia has a fairly thorough section on this and I will just summarise and directly quote it. Eye colour can change because the melanocytes responsible for the pigments have to continually produce pigment and, just like those causing colour in hair, they can become less productive (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2756/why-does-hair-turn-grey-or-white-and-why-does-it-happen-later-for-some\">which is why we have grey hair<\/a>) and this happens more with age. Infants often have blue eyes that turn dark, just like yours did, because the melanin is gradually accumulated - it just takes time for enough pigment to build up and allow the eye colour to match it's genetic determinants:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Most babies who have European ancestry have light-colored eyes before the age of one. As the child develops, melanocytes (cells found within the iris of human eyes, as well as skin and hair follicles) slowly begin to produce melanin. Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment, in theory eye color can be changed. Most eye changes happen when the infant is around one year old, although it can happen up to three years of age. Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no reflection from the back of the iris, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of melanin. An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the infant ages. An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to turn green or brown as the infant ages.\n  Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during puberty, early childhood, pregnancy, and sometimes after serious trauma (like heterochromia) do represent cause for plausible argument to state that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.\n  ... eye color over time can be subject to change, and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=642125\" rel=\"nofollow\">In this study<\/a> 10-15% of those studied had changes in eye colour beyond childhood so, al though colour is generally stable past childhood, it is not uncommon for eyes to change, and this is likely due to changes in melanin composition. <a href=\"http://www.usask.ca/biology/bortolotti/pubs/pbz-76-99-104.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This study<\/a> is an example of clour change in birds too.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A side note: Animals with other colours<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is common for animals to have other eye colours, for example Blackbirds (<em>Turdus merula<\/em>) have an Orange eye, which is caused by Carotenoid pigments, rather than melanin as in humans. The reason they have this could be as an indicator of quality in courtship - carotenoids are hard to get, males with bright orange eyes therefore have access to good food resources, and female blackbirds find that attractive.

There is increasing recognition of the prevalence of mixed\n  bacterial and viral infections, which have been documented in 23% to\n  33% of cases of pneumonia.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Then we move to the geriatric side of things with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22688530\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcone et al<\/a> (2):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Common pathogens include H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative bacilli,\n  the atypical organisms, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M.\n  catarrhalis, although the relative prevalence of each tends to vary\n  among studies.

(2)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And again in children:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are 2 main challenges in the diagnosis of CAP: the first is the\n  definition of CAP, particularly in young children, in whom bacterial\n  and viral infections can occur with similar frequencies, and in whom\n  overdiagnosis of mild symptoms and signs may lead to unnecessary\n  antibiotic use; the second is the identification of a causative pathogen, which is frequently impractical and inadequate in children, and\n  in whom the failure to isolate an organism can result in unnecessary\n  antibiotic use.

NS can act on <em>any<\/em> self-replicating entity as long as the process of replication can produce variation that can affect fitness.

No, but seriously, it is an interesting concept and a very useful tool. The selfish gene hypothesis for example, helped us see the world of evolution in terms of sequences rather than species or individuals. NS did not change, our conception of it did. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These are all useful conceptual tools that allow us as scientists to understand complex questions. However, NS is not a directed or conscious process so <em>it<\/em> does not care or know what it acts on. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS. Please do not confuse protein-coding sequences with genes. As I said in my comment, there are many genes that do not produce proteins (tRNA genes for example) and that was even before the waters were muddied in the past few years. The current definition of gene is something like:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>any nucleotide sequence with a job to do<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Read the ENCODE papers for a more technical definition or take this one from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A gene is a molecular unit of heredity of a living organism. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE: First of all, you have to remember that Dawkins wrote <em>The Extended Phenotype<\/em> more than 30 years ago, in a time when the only complete genomes available were those of a few viruses. The first bacterial genome was sequenced in the mid nineties and the first human genome draft human in 2000.

Dawkins books were instrumental in bringing genes into the spotlight.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if he <em>did<\/em> argue that a nucleotide cannot be selected (I have not read this particular book) he was simply wrong. A nucleotide can indeed affect its chances of being replicated. Think about it, if you have a <code>G<\/code> at a given position in the genome, and that <code>G<\/code> is mutated to an <code>A<\/code>, then the chances of the original <code>G<\/code> being replicated are obviously very low. Therefore, the nucleotide 'affected' its chances of replication. Alternatively, a mutation of a single nucleotide in the promoter of a gene can also cause the entire gene not to be transcribed and, as I mentioned before, frameshift mutations can wreak havoc as well. All of these are down to single nucleotides. <\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, our vision of what a gene is has changed <em>enormously<\/em> since Dawkins wrote his book, we understand the genome much better now, and we have realized that it is far more complex than originally believed. 30-year old literature about genes, even if written by such luminaries as Rihard Dawkins, should be taken with a pinch of salt today. <\/p>\n","answer_id":10053,"question_id":10050,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1377695528}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10050/smallest-unit-on-which-selection-can-act","last_activity_date":1377695528,"creation_date":1377623540,"answer_count":1,"title":"Smallest unit on which selection can act","body":"<p>Traditionally, the individual was considered to be the smallest unit on which Natural Selection (NS) acts.

Some can be altered and rearranged, accumulating exons and introns, and if they infer a fitness benefit on the organism, may be moved to fixation within a population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is a population genetics process, and there are many variables which can effect the outcome, not least the difference in populations size. The genomes of larger populations (such as those of bacteria) appear to have much smaller genomes, and of course no (at least not spliceosomal) introns, perhaps as a result of increased fitness due to the decreased generation time of an organism with a more slender genome. It would be a good idea to read <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0878934847\">The Origins of Genome Architecture<\/a> by <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~lynchlab/\">Michael Lynch<\/a>, as I think he answers your questions, better than I can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many of the genes you retrieve from EnsEMBL will of course have experimental evidence to support them.

I won't list the plants, because the list includes pretty much all of them (although the magnitude in the change of developmental pace differs widely between taxa and environments).<\/p>\n\n<p>First there is <strong>seed germination<\/strong>, which is controlled hormonally. Absence of germination is usually imposed by abscisic acid, whilst germination is caused at the appropriate time by gibberellic acid and ethylene (among other things; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02437.x\" rel=\"nofollow\">Holdsworth, Bentsink &amp; Soppe, 2008<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, in many herbaceous species there is a <strong>transition between a spreading growth stage (e.g. rosette growth) and the flowering stage<\/strong>. The 'growth spurt' here is the differentiation and elongation of the flowering stem, and then subsequently the sudden flowering of buds. The transition is also controlled hormonally, by a variety of hormones including auxin (<a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112308\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zhao, 2010<\/a>), gibberellic acid, ethylene (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-10-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schaller, 2012<\/a>), and the long anticipated, recently confirmed florigen (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001311\" rel=\"nofollow\">Choi, 2012<\/a>). Ethylene and abscisic acid then play important roles in the next developmental transition when seeds and fruits are produced and dehisced.<\/p>\n\n<p>Small RNAs are also now being revealed to play a large role in controlling the timing of developmental, but they are upstream of the hormonal changes. In particular some key miRNAs are involved in auxin-based regulation of branching, and in embryogenesis (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1986710\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nodine &amp; Bartel, 2010<\/a>), and RNA silencing is involved in the switch from rosette growth to flowering growth (reviewed in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2009.06.001\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poethig, 2009<\/a> and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.005\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baurle &amp; Dean 2006<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.005\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <strong>Bäurle I, Dean C<\/strong>. 2006.

New York\">Ricklefs, 2001<\/a>). <\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of host species<\/strong> This will lead to loss of primary consumers (specialists &amp; generalists) feeding on them, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_effect_%28ecology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">cascading effects<\/a> into the ecosystem that depends on these.  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All these changes and several others will dramatically modify the niche spaces and the competition between species in the forest patch, and most previous species will probably not be able to persist locally. New species will move in to fill the open niches, and over a (long) period of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession\" rel=\"nofollow\">succession<\/a> a new quasi-stable community will emerge. Due to the extremely high biodiversity in tropical forests it will almost certainly contain fewer species than the original community.<\/p>\n\n<p>The question of whether the community will eventually return to its previous state (even if that will take an extremely long time), is a relatively open question, and also depends on the conditions at the specific site and if the spatial scale of the disturbance. The biggest issue for conservation biology is that these land-use changes generally happen at a large scale, so <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation\" rel=\"nofollow\">fragmentation of species habitats<\/a> can lead to regional and even global extinction. Since many tropical species have small ranges and are not adapted to fragmented landscapes, many run the risk of going extinct. Therefore, even if the overall appearance of the original forest will return, it will contain a very different set of species. Land-use changes, even in the form of temporary slash-and-burn agriculture, also generally leads to continued/secondary exploitation of the area and seldom to restoration/regrowth (<a href=\"http://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Conservation_Biology.html?id=MUljQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Meffe &amp; Carroll (ed). 1997. Principles of conservation biology. Sinauer. Sunderland USA\">Meffe &amp; Carroll, 1997<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>I also want to point out that you are indirectly referring (\"...new equilibrium be reached...\") to the idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_nature\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balance of nature<\/a> in ecosystems, which is largely seen as obsolete and incorrect. However, as shorthand or when referring to a dynamical equilibrium between multiple populations (with ongoing evolutionary change) it can be meaningful.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The philosophical issue<\/h2>\n\n<p>The question of whether an ecosystem change or extinction of species is \"<em>...a bad thing<\/em>\" is inherently philosophical and depends on human judgement. The philosophical foundations for conservation biology can be divided into instrumental values and intrinsic/inherent values. <strong>Instrumental values<\/strong> can then be subcategorized as <em>services<\/em> (pollination, water regulation), <em>goods/resources<\/em>, <em>information<\/em> (e.g. genetical info to be used in medical research), and <em>esthetic/spiritual values<\/em>. <strong>Intrinsic values<\/strong> refers to a specific value placed on species, ecosystems or evolutionary history due to its uniqueness and it is seen as independent of human needs and wants (although some argue that values independent of humans are impossible). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_%28animal_ethics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intrinsic values<\/a> are also connected to the acknowledgement that organisms have interests and wants themselves (their own 'good'). Different people naturally weight these issues in different ways, and for some the short-term economical gains will weigh heavier. The long-term economic costs are potentially large, but less certain. From a strict biodiversity perspective (i.e. a species counting perspective), the change will certainly be negative, since the change in land-use will decrease diversity and probably lead to more 'trivial' species moving in. From the perspective of the original ecosystem (if it has a say) the change is per definition negative, since it will disappear. <\/p>\n\n<p>The direct intrumental value of individual species are usually uncertain (irrespectivly of the direct rationales used), so the precautionary principle is often invoked to justify species conservation. Also, numerous examples exist of how aspects of biodiversity are related to human values (some recent examples are <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6127/1608.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Garibaldi et al. 2013.

For instance, blast allows you a rapid comparison between your sequence and other sequences in a database; while Clustal, with a similar functioning, allows you to compare a set of given sequences between them. They are very simple algorithms, but very fast and useful, and basically they score an alignment by counting how many positions between the two entries are the same. Other algorithms function in a similar fashion, but they use hidden Markov models to compare your sequence with a consensual sequence in order to identify motifs and domains. I'm sure there are even more advanced programs, but I don't know them and don't think it's the point.<\/p>\n\n<p>Homology usually refers to things that share the same origin, while analogy refers to things that do the same function but their origin isn't shared. While the algorithms I've described you only search for similarity or identity, you must notice a few things:<\/p>\n\n<p>a) Homology of function doesn't necessarily correlate with high similarity. Two proteins can have the same global structure and their sequences be completely different. The three-dimensional structure is the same, and probably there'll be key amino acids that will remain very similar. This is very obvious in many proteases, which share only the three catalytic amino acids (catalytic triad) between them, and vary enormously even between strains of the same species.<\/p>\n\n<p>b) Protein domains vary in size from a few dozen to a few hundred amino acids. The odds that exactly the same sequence evolves in two separate moments are very low. Especially in highly conserved domains, which usually carry out key functions.<\/p>\n\n<p>c) Proteins usually have a modular structure with more than one domain. New proteins often evolve by switching and combining domains by translocation. So, even if the same domain has evolved in two separate times, the association between these two \"twin\" domains with other domains will probably reveal its unusual origin.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's why usually the term molecular analogy is not used, and if so, it would refer for example to structurally different domains that catalyze the same reaction or that share the same structure. Note that even if the analogy as you describe isn't impossible by itself, the software won't be able to differentiate them unless the sequence appears associated with others.

This trait has a good deal of structural homology. Now, the rigor with which we say that two traits are similar is another factor. It depends on how many variables you use to define a trait. For e.g. a snout shape can be defined using- snout dimensions, angles, bone morphology, texture etc. The more variables you add the more rigorous it becomes. Sometimes the extra variables don't give any extra info and you may choose to remove these variables (this is precisely what is done in a statistical method called Principal Component Analysis).<\/p>\n\n<p>If phylogentic study is based on these common convergent characters (snout) then we'll end up predicting that dogs and hyenas are related which is erroneous.

Even if it did, restriction enzymes could suffer mutations that may change the specificity. When you talk about microorganisms, it's more accurate to think in populations rather than individuals, since the colony would be able to grow again if they have at least one cell. Viruses need a certain density to spread, so even if the bacteria cannot defend against, it may be able to survive simply because the virus run out of hosts before some cells can be infected. This is even easier if the bacteria have some kind of resistance form.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, restriction-modification systems aren't the only defense line against viruses. Many bacteria have a system called CRISPR-CAS that acts like an immune system, inserting RNA fragments into the bacterial chromosome and using them as \"antibodies\" by hybridization. In this context, you can assume that restriction-modification systems, alongside other nucleases they usually carry, act as an innate immune system, while the CRISPR-CAS would be an analog to acquired immunity.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/copis.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Diagram of the CRISPR-CAS system. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7320/fig_tab/468045a_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, not every environment has the same viral density.

Insects may have complete or incomplete metamorphosis, being the complete more complicated. Even inside the first group (wich in fact contains most of the insects since coleoptera, diptera, lepidoptera and himenoptera have complete metamorphosis) there are important differences. However, I'll try to explain some basics.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, metamorphosis is a molting-related process. It's regulated by the same hormones and they share many characteristics. In insects with uncomplete metamorphosis, this is very visible, since the \"metamorphosis\" is the last molt, wich usually involves growth, sexual maturity and the development of functional wings. <\/p>\n\n<p>The choice between a regular larval molt is determined primarily by the levels of juvenil hormone, wich decays during the last larval instar (pupae and adult are instars, too). The molting is triggered by a peak of ecdysone, an steroid.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once the insect has entered into the state of pupae, the organs start to suffer diverse changes. The formation of adult organs <em>de novo<\/em> arise from some special structures called imaginal discs, wich are clusters of stem cells that are more or less isolated in the larvae.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQXkP.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Position of the imaginal discs in Drosophila. <a href=\"http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=367\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Note that diptera larvae lack legs, mandibles and even head, while coleptera larvae usually have true legs, a set of mandibles and many other adult features.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mp2n3.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>A typical larva of a coleoptera of the genus <em>Lucanus<\/em>. Note the mandibles and the legs. <a href=\"http://bugguide.net/node/view/15821\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some other organs remain more or less the same, such as the hearts or many parts of the nervous system. On the other side, some larval organs needs to dissapear and suffer programmed cell death. The gut, many parts of the nervous system, between others, suffer modifications that may be more or less drastic. In many cases this happen by simple growth and differenciation of the tissue or degeneration by apoptosis, but in some others the whole organs suffers apoptosis and regenerates itself with adult characteristics.  For example, the innervation of the abdominal parapods (false legs) in caterpillars suffer a progressive degeneration, while the opposite happens in toracic nerves, wich will have to control legs and wings. This whole process is pretty similar to embrionic development and it shares many traits with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, metamorphosis in other animals, such as crustaceans, vertabrates (fishes and amphibians), echinodermae, annelidae, cnidaria and many others will probably vary widely. I know for sure that amphibians metamorphosis is regulated by tiroid hormones, but I'm not even sure that many of the other examples have even been studied at a phisiological level. <\/p>\n","answer_id":9907,"question_id":9901,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9901/what-happens-during-metamorphosis","last_activity_date":1377191145,"creation_date":1377115594,"answer_count":1,"title":"What happens during metamorphosis?","body":"<p>We were studying butterflies in class and I asked my 7th grade teacher, but she deemed the concept \"too complicated.\" I'm really curious now, not only about butterflies but insects in general...<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","question_id":9901,"tags":["entomology"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":9907,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":199,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1377191145},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed4e218a4f08a17c9ba1bf2c2fd6e214?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4297,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4297/ben","reputation":1,"display_name":"ben"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":2,"post_id":9912,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377152456,"comment_id":13029,"body":"It&#39;s possible that the gardening stack exchange might provide better answers if you&#39;re interested in their differences in regards to composting."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":9912,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377157256,"comment_id":13035,"body":"@Mys-721tx&#39;s answer (excellent, by the way!) is the type of response you&#39;ll get here."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb0d3bf434b794176466f428a6d681db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4136/mys-721tx","reputation":105,"display_name":"Mys_721tx"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e8d0828732c8eb54a0335e7eab1ec9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":112,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/112/michael-kuhn","reputation":3583,"display_name":"Michael Kuhn","accept_rate":75},"score":1,"post_id":9914,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377175262,"comment_id":13040,"body":"The time of divergence within the nematodes is already estimated to be &gt;500 million years <a href=\"http://www.timetree.org/pdf/Blaxter2009Chap28.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">timetree.org/pdf/Blaxter2009Chap28.pdf<\/a> -- so the divergence of annelids and annelids must be even earlier"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550973bfc1f6c08ff29efee9a1cc7fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":2938,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/2938/jack-aidley","reputation":3478,"display_name":"Jack Aidley"},"score":0,"post_id":9914,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377179473,"comment_id":13044,"body":"What does &quot;there are about 41 amino-acid substitutions per site&quot; mean?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb0d3bf434b794176466f428a6d681db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4136/mys-721tx","reputation":105,"display_name":"Mys_721tx"},"score":0,"post_id":9914,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e8d0828732c8eb54a0335e7eab1ec9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":112,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/112/michael-kuhn","reputation":3583,"display_name":"Michael Kuhn","accept_rate":75},"edited":false,"creation_date":1377186271,"comment_id":13045,"body":"@MichaelKuhn It&#39;s probably true.

As you can see its not perfect, but there are definitely patterns.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are some weird dose-dependent effects like in the case of indole which is labeled as flowery/fecal, which are two pretty distinct smells.  Apparently its fecal at high doses, and smells like jasmine at low doses.  My guess is that this has to do with different binding affinities of the different olfactory receptors (ORs) that are expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).  Many odorants will bind to multiple ORs, which means they will stimulate a characteristic sub-population of ORNs.  The binding to the different ORs will of course have different affinities.  This probably means that at low concentrations of indoles, you stimulate a certain population of ORNs that your brain recognizes as nice flowers, but as you increase the concentration you get the activation of ORNs with ORs that have a weaker binding to indole, changing the population of activated ORNs to one that your brain recognizes as feces.  Its definitely a strange pairing though..<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not familiar enough with the literature to know if the similar smelling things have similar ORN activation patterns, but my guess would be that they do.  If you have a population of different ORs that your odorant is binding to, a slightly different odorant will probably bind to a similar subset of ORs, just off by a few if its missing or has gained a functional group that is in the binding pocket of some of the ORs.  This probably means that if you are presented with a chemical that you have never smelled before, it will probably activate a similar ORN population as other similar chemicals, and your brain will probably say it smells like one of those similar chemicals.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9909,"question_id":9908,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1377161715}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9908/are-similar-smells-usually-based-on-similar-chemicals","last_activity_date":1377161715,"creation_date":1377126884,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are similar smells usually based on similar chemicals?","body":"<p>Building off of this question: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9894/why-does-freshly-cut-grass-smell-like-a-watermelon\">Why does freshly cut grass smell like a watermelon?<\/a>, is it usually the case that things that we perceive as having similar smells are, in fact, the same or a similar chemical hitting our noses (as in the case of cis-3-hexanal in watermelon/cut grass), or is it often a cognitive thing (we're bad at parsing smells, so when confronted with a new smell, we fish around in our experience to find something that seems familiar, even if there's not much chemical similarity)?<\/p>\n","question_id":9908,"tags":["biochemistry","sensation","perception","olfaction"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":9909,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":208,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1377132827},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eff5cd5e0237a1e9c53f352c052fd7ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4123,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4123/rook","reputation":148,"display_name":"rook"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqkqP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4101/amory","reputation":7383,"display_name":"Amory"},"score":0,"post_id":9894,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377110671,"comment_id":13005,"body":"I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever experienced that, but a cursory Google search indicates this is not unheard of.

(but who am I to tell you what to do - these are just suggestions).  <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The First suggestion I have is <a href=\"http://biodynamics.ucsd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeff Hasty at UCSD<\/a>.  He has focused a lot on oscillating gene circuits.  He has simple systems that might be reproducible with a small lab, most recent work that combines a GFP oscillator with LUX is pretty cool. Both oscillators and LUX are independently good systems to work with. .  I've been a science fair judge and I can tell you, just reproducing one of his systems would be an impressive lot of work<\/p>\n\n<p>Another body of work to look at is <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=u7WiGLQAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;view_op=list_works\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam Arkin<\/a>. He has looked at lots of circuitry component candidates.  Articles such as \"The hunt for the biological transistor\" might get you thinking.  This is a broader body of work, and so it might take a while to get an idea from it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Third, if this is boring to you and you want to look more broadly, you can look through the <a href=\"http://igem.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">iGEM competitions<\/a>.  These are projects with oscillators and bio synthesis systems which sometimes have mathematical models associated with them.  The big advantage here is that you might be able to start or join an iGEM team and then some or all the plasmids will be made already - mol bio gets very expensive if someone doesn't gift you some materials. <\/p>\n","answer_id":9895,"question_id":9886,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9886/suggestions-for-an-experiment","last_activity_date":1377113572,"creation_date":1377047298,"answer_count":1,"title":"Suggestions for an experiment?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>I would appreciate suggestions for my year-long AP Biology project.

Orr (2005; also Whitlock et al., 1995; Kryazhimskiy et al., 2009) explains that <strong>most experimental results do not actually attempt to measure the fitness landscape<\/strong>, but instead report just the average fitness versus time and average number of acquired adaptations versus time. This can't be used to discern epistatic interactions, or any combinatorial structure of the landscape. In general, the <strong>theory of adaptive walks has developed without reference to real data<\/strong> and even the most refined theories can only correspond in vague qualitative ways (see Kryazhimskiy et al., 2009 for the best example I know).<\/p>\n\n<p>Szendro et al. (2013) surveyed the few recent experiments that conducted a methodical examination of all mutations in a subset of loci of model organisms, but <strong>most studies (6 out of 12) were able to empirically realize only small fitness landscapes of just 4 to 5 loci (so 16 to 32 vertexes)<\/strong>, with the largest full fitness landscape having length 6 with all 64 vertexes examined (Hall et al., 2010), and the largest number of vertexes in a single study being 418 out of the possible 512 in a length 9 landscape (O\u2019Maille et al., 2008). These are extremely small landscapes, and thus don't have much power in distinguishing proposed theoretical models.<\/p>\n\n<p>After extensive searching, I have not been able to find examples of theorists doing worst case analysis of fitness landscapes. The <strong>closest to worst-case analysis is Orr-Gillespie theory<\/strong> (Gillespie, 1991; Orr, 2002; 2006; Kryazhimskiy et al., 2009) that assumes that the wild-type is still very fit after an environmental change, and so beneficial mutations are extremely rate. This allows the authors to introduce <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory\">extreme value theory<\/a> and consider just the asymptotic properties of distribution tails thus allowing a more general treatment with fewer parameters; in some cases leading to a full classification of adaptive trajectories (Kryazhimskiy et al., 2009). This approach is easier to relate to experiment, but unfortunately <strong>completely ignores the combinatorial structure (beyond first-order) of the fitness landscape<\/strong> and always just samples the next potential mutant from the tail of a distribution without taking into account how it is progressing in the landscape. Although Orr (2006) introduced the basics of fitness landscape structure, the structure was much simpler than the NK model; he used Perelson &amp; Macken's (1995) block model with each block as completely unstructured beyond first-order.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<p>Gillespie, J.H.

Although it is definitely possible to justify this random generation, it tends to produce a very structured fitness landscapes, that although rugged (for high $K$), has a very regular distribution of local fitness optima.
