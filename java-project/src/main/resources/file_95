Schematic presentation of the tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method. The single nucleotide polymorphism used here as an example is a G→A substitution, but the method can be used to type other types of single base substitutions. Two allele-specific amplicons are generated using two pairs of primers, one pair (indicated by pink and red arrows, respectively) producing an amplicon representing the G allele and the other pair (indicated by indigo and blue arrows, respectively) producing an amplicon representing the A allele. Allele specificity is conferred by a mismatch between the 3\u2032-terminal base of an inner primer and the template. To enhance allelic specificity, a second deliberate mismatch (indicated by an asterisk) at position \u20132 from the 3\u2032-terminus is also incorporated in the inner primers. The primers are 26 nt or longer, so as to minimize the difference in stability of primers annealed to the target and non-target alleles, ensuring that allele specificity results from differences in extension rate, rather than hybridisation rate. By positioning the two outer primers at different distances from the polymorphic nucleotide, the two allele-specific amplicons differ in length, allowing them to be discriminated by gel electrophoresis.

The majority of the world's population have this phenotype. <\/p>\n\n<p>In these individuals, at weaning, there is a reduction in the level of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for digesting lactose to galactose and glucose in the small intestine. Undigested lactose can create symptoms via osmotic effects (causing diarrhoea) and because it is metabolised by bacteria in the colon, producing gas and thus abdominal bloating.<\/p>\n\n<p>About 35% of adults have a genetic variant in an region upstream of the lactase gene which results in the expression of lactase continuing into adult life. These individuals are lactose tolerant. This trait is most common in Northern Europe.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to references cited in  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ingram, CJE et al.

Variation in the composition of the gut flora between individuals, as well as a psychosomatic component may account for some of the interindividual variation in symptoms.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The clear implication is that there is a lot of variation in the tolerance of lactose amongst those lacking the lactase persistence trait. Given the contribution of the gut flora to the symptoms these could presumably vary as a result of, for example, antibiotic treatment. Also I imagine that the effects of undigested lactose could be synergistic with some other gut disturbance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Added in response to comment from the OP:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In someone with the (common) genotype that corresponds to 'no persistence of lactase' the possibility of showing symptoms will be present from a young age. Apparently there is a lot of variation in the severity of symptoms. If an adult suddenly exhibits symptoms then I am suggesting that this could be due to an interaction of non-persistence with some other gut disturbance - I imagine this could happen quite quickly.

Let me know if I am mistaken.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of epistasis might be confused with the one of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">pleyotropy<\/a>, so I will define both terms.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pleyotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotypic<\/a> traits. Note: the phenotype, to make it simply is what a living things look like (its cells, proteins, shape of the face, size of the leaves, etc\u2026). It is often thought in duality with the genotype which is the total genetic information contained in an individual that codes for the phenotype (Be careful, the environment is also an important factor influencing the phenotype, if you make sports you will have big muscles!)<\/p>\n\n<p>Epistasis is when the effect on the phenotype of one gene depends on the presence of several (or only one) other genes. Wikipedia gives this (simplistic) example:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1aj31m.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here, two bi-allelic genes are involved. One gene that determines the hair color. The two alleles influence the phenotype such: one allele gives red hair and the other allele gives blond hair. Now There's another bi-allelic gene coding for baldness. One allele causes the bearer to be hairy and the other one causes the bearer to be bald. Therefore, if an individual carries the allele \"Bald\" in the \"Baldness\" loci, what this individual carries on the other loci is not important because it will result into the same phenotype anyway, he is bald. Now if in the baldness loci, the allele is \"Hairy\", then the expression of the other gene \"Hair color\" matters and therefore if the allele is \"blond\", the bearer has blond hair and if the allele is \"red\" the bearer has red hair.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"Baldness\" gene is called a modifier. One can also say that the expression the \"Hair color\" gene depends on the genetic background of the individual.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now cases of epistasis are not always that easy and if they influence the fitness, this kind of epistatic interaction might have implications for their evolution.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14522,"question_id":14521,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1390059291}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14521/a-basic-example-of-the-interactions-of-2-or-more-non-identical-alleles-leading-t","last_activity_date":1390059291,"creation_date":1390050698,"answer_count":1,"title":"A basic example of the interactions of 2 or more non-identical alleles leading to an advantageous outcome for an individual organism","body":"<p>Could someone help me out with a basic example of the interactions of 2 or more non-identical alleles leading to an advantageous outcome for an individual organism?

As such, it is usually best to avoid them, especially when talking to a lay audience. The main mistake creationists perpetuate when thinking about micro-vs-macro evolution, is that the two are somehow different and distinct physical processes. This is simply not the case, they are both <em>just evolution<\/em>. The scientific distinction between the terms, comes not from the physical world around us, but from how we choose to talk about it. When a biologist says \"microevolution\" or \"macroevolution\" they are actually signaling what kind of questions they are interested in asking, or what sort of tools they plan on using.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Verbal and empirical theories<\/h2>\n\n<p>In verbal and empirical theories, the micro-macro distinction is usually one of timescales. A person in the macroevolutionary paradigm, usually asks questions <em>above<\/em> the level of individual species, as <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/VIADefinition.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolution 101 writes<\/a> (emphasis mine):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\ninstead of focusing on an individual beetle species, a macroevolutionary lens might require that we <b>zoom out on the tree of life<\/b>, to assess the diversity of the <b>entire beetle clade<\/b> and its position on the tree.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Empirically, macroevolutionary answers to these sort of questions are usually ones that don't have access to detailed evolutionary histories or direct experiment. Instead, the method tends to be ones that use geology, fossils, and back-inferences from broad differences/similarities of existing species. As such, most macroevolutionary theories tend to be descriptive, instead of predictive. Most of paleontology can be classified under the macroevolutionary paradigm.<\/p>\n\n<p>If someone explicitly says that they are looking at microevolution then this usually refers to a contrasting methodology that tends to be heavy on direct experimental manipulation. Most importantly, microevolutionists tend to have access to rich and detailed evolutionary histories. As such, it is not surprising that you saw a study that identified itself as microevolutionary while looking at different species of <em>Drosophila<\/em>. The fruit fly is one of the widest used model organisms, and as such the study you are referring to probably experimentally manipulated populations of fruit flies and collected a rich dataset of genetic changes in the generations of fruit flies that they studied.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, most studies are at intermittent levels, and no this isn't called meso-evolution (except by silly people). If you are not clearly using the macroevolutionary nor the microevolutionary <em>paradigm<\/em> but still looking at evolution, you would just simply say 'evolutionary' without any prefix.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Formal and mathematical models<\/h2>\n\n<p>For formal and mathematical theories, the micro/macro distinction is also one of methods used by the theorist not of the underlying domain they are studying. <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/7929/500\">Mathematical modeling of evolution falls into two broad categories: frequency-dependent and frequency-independent models<\/a>. Frequency-dependent models almost never make the micro-macro distinction. Although you could argue that dynamic models in evolutionary game theory are micro, and static equilibrium concepts like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\">ESS<\/a> are macro, but I doubt theorists would endorse this view. As such, I will focus on the frequency-independent models.<\/p>\n\n<p>For frequency-independent models, they key concept is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape\" rel=\"nofollow\">fitness landscape<\/a> -- a way to map each genotype to a fitness. If the model tracks a population (a distribution over vertices in the fitness graph) on a static fitness landscape, then it would typically be just called an evolutionary model (the word microevolutionary is seldom used explicitly in this field). However, if the authors assume that mutations are extremely rare and thus any mutant goes to fixation before a new one arises then they can use Gillespie (1983, 1984) to replace the population by a single \"typical individual\" occupying one vertex of the fitness graph. At this point, the model becomes macroevolutionary and the <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/2638/500\">underlying rule for calculating fixation probabilities<\/a> would be the microevolutionary component. This approach is often also coupled with an alternation of change in fitness landscape followed by mutations and a selective sweep. Fundamentally, though, macroevolutionary models are just convenient (or tractable) approximations to a real underlying evolutionary dynamics. This should <em>never<\/em> be forgotten.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Strange example bridging the gaps<\/h2>\n\n<p>Finally, it is important to stress that the macro- and micro-evolutionary paradigms are not necessarily exclusive and <strong>do not<\/strong> have to correspond to a difference in timescales! This is best done with an example of a respected theoretical study that mixes everything together. Kauffman &amp; Weinberger (1989) used their newly developed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">NK model or rugged fitness landscapes<\/a> to study <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation\" rel=\"nofollow\">maturation of the immune response<\/a> (Tonegawa, 1983). The developed a macroevolutionary mathematical model because they used Gillespie's trick to replace a population by a typical individual by abstracting away from the underlying microevolutionary calculation of fixation probabilities. However, their model was studying evolutionary dynamics within the human immune system (so timescales of days to weeks) and was tuned by parameters gathered by empirical microevolutionary studies that tracked individual nucleotide changes (Crews et al., 1981; Tonegawa, 1983; Clark et al., 1985). Lastly, the study results can be used to inform a question typical of verbal macroevolutionary theory: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/7921/500\">Are there any examples of sudden leaps in evolution?<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As such, the above study used a formal macroevolutionary model, informed by empirical microevolutionary work, to help us understand a question typical of verbal macroevolution while looking at a physical process that operated on the incredibly short timescale of days to weeks. No wonder people are so confused by the micro-macro \"divide\"!<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>References<\/h2>\n\n<p>Clark, S.H., Huppi, K., Ruezinsky, D., Staudt, L., Gerhard, W., &amp; Weigert, M. (1985).

But as with all things, the long version is ways more complicated:<\/p>\n\n<p>The extrinsic pathway is activated when you damage tissue and factor VII come in contact with tissue factor (also known as factor III). Tissue factor is located in the membrane of the cells and is only released when the cells are damaged. \nThen the cascade starts and delivers a very fast large amounts of active thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin to build a block of the damaged blood vessel. The step from the thrombin is common between both pathways.<\/p>\n\n<p>The intric pathway is also called the \"contact pathway\", which starts when the factor VII comes in contact with collagen or anionic surfaces. \nThe main advantage of this pathway is the strong amplification of the initial signal from the intrinsic pathway by a factor of about 1000 fold. The intrinsic pathway is also co-activated by active thrombin (which stands at the end of the cascade) meaning it is also a powerfull feedback loop to make the initial reaction much stronger.

Briefly, a <em>p<\/em>-value of 0.1 says (roughly) that there\u2019s a 10% chance (0.1) of the observed result being as extreme<sup>1<\/sup> as it is simply due to chance (sampling variation from a population), <em>assuming the null hypothesis is true<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often, 5% is more or less arbitrarily chosen as \u201ccut-off\u201d: results with <em>p<\/em>-values below that (which occur by chance 1 time out of 20) are called <em>significant<\/em> \u2013 results above are insignificant.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, this directly implies that when doing multiple studies, say 20, there\u2019s a very high chance of getting a \u201csignificant\u201d result by pure chance, without there being a real effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>GWAS studies essentially perform experiments on many (hundreds or thousands) of factors simultaneously. Therefore, reporting the pure <em>p<\/em>-values would be very misleading since there would be a lot of spurious results with \u201csignificant\u201d <em>p<\/em>-values. The probability of getting one or more spurious hits is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familywise_error_rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">familywise error rate (FWER)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FWER can be reduced by <em>adjusting<\/em> the <em>p<\/em> values, for instance by performing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonferroni correction<\/a>.

Some argue that the abundance and diversity depends on temperature and human impact that is what explain this pattern. There is a theoretical model that cut the mountains into three patches along the altitudinal gradient and assume that plants - when they reproduce - either send seeds in the same patch or in a nearby patch. Because, the patch in the middle can receive gene flow from both \"sides\" while the \"extremities\" can receive gene flow only from one \"side\", the diversity is greater in the middle patch.<\/p>\n\n<p>In aquatic communities, there is very few physical barrier to gene flow and therefore, speciation often occur through sympatry (I think!). Depth has an important role in isolating population (allowing allopatric speciation) because of the sensory drive evolution. Some fishes (to talk only about fishes) have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin\" rel=\"nofollow\">opsins<\/a> (proteins involved in vision) that are adapted to deep water while other fishes have opsins adapted to shallow water. This divergence, allows to push fishes to chose a preferential habitat and prevent gene flow.<\/p>\n\n<p>High temperatures lead to high mutation rate and high mutation rate leads to high speciation rate (I think).<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of past glaciation, it has been found that species in southern hemisphere are younger in average than those in northern hemisphere. Therefore, past ecology has to be taken in account when talking about present diversity. Land mass of different size might also impact species diversity differently.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think a theory that explain species diversity along these three gradients might be easily found. I would tend to think these three gradients are important because they are correlated with parameters that influence species diversity in several ways. Those correlated variables are temperature, humidity, light, time of daylight, land mass, connectivity (rivers that increase gene from mountain to valley or surrounding land mass for example), human impact, \u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>What did you mean \"energy related gradient\"?

Scaling and power-laws in ecological systems<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>A couple of caveats/ideas though; first of all, it has been argued that the latitudinal gradient of species richness is likely to be due to many different mechanisms in different taxa (see <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6783/full/405220a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Gaston. 2000. Global patterns in biodiversity. Nature 405: 220-227\">Gaston, 2000<\/a>). Here you are looking for a hypothesis to explain not only this single pattern, but all three of them, which makes a single explanation even less likely. Second, many non-exclusive explanations have been put forward for the latitudinal gradient. Even if we don't know which ones of these that are the true mechanisms, some are clearly incompatible with being explanations for all the three patterns you mention, while others might be applicable to all of them. For instance, environmental stability in the tropics is one suggested mechanism for the latitudinal gradient, but this doesn't make much sense for a gradient along ocean depth (deep sea has arguably been a more stable environment both over shorter and longer time-frames). It might be relevant for an altitude gradient though. Going through different hypothesised explanations for the latitudinal gradient in this way (from what I know, the best studied of these gradients) could give you a list of ideas that are most interesting to target (maybe somebody has already done this though). <\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14480,"question_id":14472,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1389800135}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14472/is-there-a-hypothesis-that-attempts-to-explain-patterns-of-species-richness-alon","last_activity_date":1389800135,"creation_date":1389701293,"answer_count":3,"title":"Is there a hypothesis that attempts to explain patterns of species richness along all three energy-related environmental gradients?","body":"<p>My question is related to one of the oldest question in ecology: \"What determines global patterns of species richness?\".

The number the come out from a dice is random unless you know exactly how the dice was thrown (and make some calculation about the cinematic of the dice).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Consciousness is in itself rather hard to define as well. I think several definitions has been suggested in science and philosophy. But I don't know much about these definitions.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Anyway even with these philosophical issue behind the question, one can quite safely say that no, self-counsciousness is not a necessary consequence of evolution. The condition under which greater cognitive abilities is beneficial are quite restrictive and even today the way that human cognition evolved is under debate. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">This wiki article<\/a> will give you an introduction into this field. The immense majority of all lineage did not evolve great cognitive abilities (Have a look to different tree of life and to the diversity of life).<\/p>\n\n<p>In humans, a fourth of the total amount of ATP (molecule that is the equivalent of a battery of living organism) is dedicated to the brain. This is a huge cost! It seems quite extraordinary that something so costly can evolve because the benefit are quite hard to grasp. For example. A bird with a heavy brain won't fly well, therefore it is counter-selected. What would a beetle do with a big brain? Well not many things. It would only be a cost with no benefit. Natural selection does not favor cognitive abilities for most of the lineages and as already said, great cognition is favored only under some restrictive conditions. Intelligence is by no-mean the end-point, the goal or the consequence of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to calculate the probability of something to happen you need some a priori knowledge.  For example, the probability of drawing the king of heart in a deck of card obviously depends on wether you consider that you know how many cards there are in the deck. You might say that you don't know how many cards are in the deck but you know that 10% of all deck in the world have 36 cards and the rest 90% of the decks have 52 cards (it would be much more complex in reality). The probability would be different. What are your a priori knowledge? What is the probability given the that X species exist at a given time, given how the environment changed over time, given that life is made of DNA, given the size of the earth, \u2026? But then even if you give tons of information about your a priori knowledge (which include defining life and intelligence), then it seems to me terribly complicated to determine this probability with theoretical work. Doing so with empirical work is obviously impossible. We would need many earth-like planets and 4000 million years.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14435,"question_id":14434,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1389610792},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7efc1a24e82cb19c6d0744a4db2e62e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5392,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5392/th334","reputation":416,"display_name":"Th334"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3395"},"score":0,"post_id":14448,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389609178,"comment_id":19097,"body":"Philosophers and physicists argue among themselves whether nature is random or not and even whether this is a proper question.

A few ideas you should understand to realize why it is so random.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most people are only aware of natural selection when it comes to evolution, and think that natural selection has a goal of creating new, increasingly sophisticated forms of life. None of this, of course, is true. Evolution is not only natural selection, there's also genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation, which are random. Natural selection is not technically random, but it's not the biggest player. Secondly, natural selection does not have any goals and does not move forward, create more complex life, invent adaptations, or does anything of this sort. <strong>Natural selection is not designed to produce perfection<\/strong>, it just acts upon whatever variation is present in population, and favours individuals that are more successful in reproduction. Case study: 98% of our DNA doesn't code for any proteins, and presumably most of this DNA is junk. Does it sound like perfection to you, like we are the ultimate species?<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason I tell you all this is because, in my opinion, when asking this question of \"inevitability\", you assume that there's some guiding hand that leads evolution towards some end-point, a climax. But there is no such guiding hand, and it takes a number of incredibly unlikely events to occur in a specific order for: Earth to be created with such conditions, life to start on Earth, collective learning to evolve in some form of live, agricultural revolution to occur so this form of life can thrive, etc. If at any stage something went different, everything would be different.<\/p>\n\n<p>Final thoughts, why are you so sure that humans won't go extinct just like 99.9% of all the species that ever existed on Earth? A typical species goes extinct in about 10 million years, and we've been around for only 200,000 years. If you accept this possibility (which is real, in my opinion), suddenly, it doesn't seem that intelligent life, and we as its representatives, is some inevitable end-point in evolution, does it?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited:<\/strong> As to your last (new) question, \"if randomness in evolution exists, are we still able to describe the general trends in evolution?\". Firstly, of course randomness exists in evolution! Mutations are caused by <strong>errors<\/strong> in the process of DNA replication, genetic drift is caused by <strong>random<\/strong> sampling by definition. Secondly, there is no universal trend to more complicated organisms being evolved, as I mentioned above. Some organisms do get more complex, but some organisms haven't changed much over very long time, some are \"living-fossils\". Once again, evolution has no goal to create more complex life -- if, say, nautiluses or horseshoe crabs are capable of surviving and reproducing in the niches they occupy -- there's nothing else needed for their existence. Furthermore, fitness is linked to the environment, which is dynamic -- many complex species went extinct during global changes in the environment, whereas what you might call as \"primitive\" species of unicellular bacteria survived.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14448,"question_id":14434,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1389624622},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7efc1a24e82cb19c6d0744a4db2e62e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5392,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5392/th334","reputation":416,"display_name":"Th334"},"score":0,"post_id":14450,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389607514,"comment_id":19095,"body":"In my experience, often times after the phrase &quot;imagine a simplified scenario&quot; something simple can suddenly get quite confusing.

Since many studies in prokaryotes have shown direct correlations between the frequencies of transcription and mutation, we conducted in silico analyses using the computer program, mfg, which simulates transcription and predicts the location of known mutable bases in loops of high-stability secondary structures. Mfg analyses of the p53 tumor suppressor gene predicted the location of mutable bases and mutation frequencies correlated with the extent to which these mutable bases were exposed in secondary structures. In vitro analyses have now confirmed that the 12 most mutable bases in p53 are in fact located in predicted ssDNA loops of these structures. Data show that genotoxins have two independent effects on mutagenesis and the incidence of cancer: Firstly, they activate p53 transcription, which increases the number of exposed mutable bases and also increases mutation frequency. Secondly, genotoxins increase the frequency of G-to-T transversions resulting in a decrease in G-to-A and C mutations. This precise compensatory shift in the 'fate' of G mutations has no impact on mutation frequency. Moreover, it is consistent with our proposed mechanism of mutagenesis in which the frequency of G exposure in ssDNA via transcription is rate limiting for mutation frequency in vivo.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":8868,"question_id":8860,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1371778247}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8860/transcriptionally-mediated-dna-damage","last_activity_date":1389649464,"creation_date":1371680884,"answer_count":1,"title":"Transcriptionally-mediated DNA damage","body":"<p>I'm researching the genetics of brain cancer, and finding a huge number of mutations in voltage-gated channels.

This is the initial step to turn the DNA a more compact structure. Citing the advantages of an extremely compact but flexible structure like chromosomes would make this answer a little longer (if you want, I can add them later), and to answer your question faster, we'd better keep moving on the discussion. <br/>Epigenetics and gene expression are so beautiful that they have many mechanisms to regulate or change gene expression, and you mention one, which is done by reversible covalent modifications on histones. Such modifications are executed by especific proteins, that can do methylation, acetylation, phosphorilation in some aminoacids of histones. <br/>When an aminoacid of a histone is linked with charged groups (e.g: methyl, acetyl) its charge is altered, and depending of the resulting charge (negative or positive), it can reduce or increase the afinity between the histone tail and the adjacent nucleosomes, and therefore, make the nucleosome more compact and less accessible or less compact and more accessible, respectively. <br/>But the main effect of these covalent modifications on histones is that the groups added to the aminoacids act like markers indicating for proteins involved in expression (like transcriptional factors and RNA polymerase) that some genes are switched on or switched off. The patterns of this modifications (which one repress or estimulate gene expression) is not completely understood yet.<br/>An example of how a certain region is chosen to be marked for expression or repression: <br/>Consider an organism that has received a repressed gene related to obesity from its parents and this organism is lazy, eats a lot, has a sedentary life. As a result of all this stimulation, the proteins responsible for altering the histones of the gene related to obesity can be activated or recruited by others proteins, and make covalent modifications in a way that the histones of that gene now are marked for it to be expressed. This organism can pass the new mark to the its children and they will have propensity to obesity due to the activated gene. (This final example was an experiment of epigenetics using rats, I saw a long time ago, so I can't remember the reference).<br/>And about if it's casual or not, the marks of regulation in a sequence of DNA can't be casual. For each one or two modifications of histones there is an enzyme that will only do its function if some event is already triggered or if it's triggered during the cell life depending on the environment the cell is exposed to. So millions of cells of a same tissue that have the same function would not have the same pattern of expression for the main genes related with that function by chance. Therefore, regulation of gene expression is very refined and histone marks are one of the many mechanisms that together dictate if a gene is repressed or expressed.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8460,"question_id":5284,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1369218251}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5284/histone-marks-mechanism","last_activity_date":1389648970,"creation_date":1353466282,"answer_count":1,"title":"Histone marks mechanism","body":"<p>I am slightly confused about the mechanisms that makes histone modifications associate with gene expression.<\/p>\n\n<p>That is, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_code#Modifications\" rel=\"nofollow\">H3K36me3<\/a> is believed to be present in actively transcribed genes, H3K27me3 in repressed regions, etc. What is the mechanism that makes the presence of H3K36me3 to be in active regions, etc.?

An <em>antigen<\/em> is a molecule that can be associated with a particular substance (virus, pollen, dander.) When an immunoglobulin or <em>antibody<\/em> recognizes an antigen it binds to a specific <em>epitope<\/em>. An antibody recognizes an epitope using its <em>paratope<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some antigens have multiple epitopes; this means that different antibodies can simultaneously bind to them (if the epitopes are far-enough apart from each other so that binding to one doesn't preclude binding to the others.) <\/p>\n\n<p>An example from my work is influenza (flu) hemagglutinin, which is a major viral coat protein. <a href=\"http://pdbj.org/emnavi/emnavi_detail.php?id=5731\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a low-resolution structure showing a \"head-binding\" antibody fragment (actually three of them)<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://pdbj.org/emnavi/emnavi_detail.php?id=5794\" rel=\"nofollow\">here's a similar structure showing a \"stem-binding\" antibody fragment<\/a>. Our immune repertoire (and physiology) greatly predisposes us towards producing head-binding antibodies over stem-binders. Note that each structure has three antibody fragments bound in the same state. Because the head-binder and stem-binder antibodies are well-separated in space they can both be accommodated in a single complex (as is experimentally confirmed.)

It is unfortunate that more people don't understand what \"radiation\" is and how it affects biology.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, you must distinguish between ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation.\nWikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation\" rel=\"nofollow\">describes<\/a> the former rather well:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ionizing (or ionising) radiation is radiation composed of particles that individually carry enough kinetic energy to liberate an electron from an atom or molecule, ionizing it. ...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>When ionizing radiation is emitted by or absorbed by an atom, it can liberate an atomic particle (typically an electron, proton, or neutron, but sometimes an entire nucleus) from the atom. Such an event can alter chemical bonds and produce ions, usually in ion-pairs, that are especially chemically reactive.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>X-rays, alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all ionizing forms of radiation. Non-ionizing radiation, as you might guess, is radiation of a sort which lacks enough energy to to strip an electron from an atom. All light is actually \"radiation.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason why ionizing radiation can be so damaging is because the molecular underpinnings of our cells depend on many very specific chemical bonds. Changing those bonds can damage or even break anything from proteins to strands of DNA itself. Our bodies naturally try to repair damage, but the <em>amount<\/em> of damage is a crucial factor in how successful our bodies can be. More radiation means more damage; also greater amounts of radiation increases the chances of serious genetic damage to one or more cells. Damaging a cell's rulebook in just the right ways can disable its repair processes and even its fail-safes that keep it from becoming a hazard to the rest of the body (such as growing uncontrollably into a cancerous tumor).<\/p>\n\n<p>A more in depth explanation of radiation effects can be found at <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/health_effects.html#q1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/health_effects.html#q1<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In general, the amount and duration of radiation exposure affects the severity or type of health effect. There are two broad categories of health effects: stochastic and non-stochastic.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Stochastic Health Effects<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Stochastic effects are associated with long-term, low-level (chronic) exposure to radiation. (\"Stochastic\" refers to the likelihood that something will happen.) Increased levels of exposure make these health effects more likely to occur, but do not influence the type or severity of the effect.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Cancer is considered by most people the primary health effect from radiation exposure. Simply put, cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. Ordinarily, natural processes control the rate at which cells grow and replace themselves. They also control the body's processes for repairing or replacing damaged tissue. Damage occurring at the cellular or molecular level, can disrupt the control processes, permitting the uncontrolled growth of cells cancer This is why ionizing radiation's ability to break chemical bonds in atoms and molecules makes it such a potent carcinogen.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Other stochastic effects also occur. Radiation can cause changes in DNA, the \"blueprints\" that ensure cell repair and replacement produces a perfect copy of the original cell. Changes in DNA are called mutations.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Sometimes the body fails to repair these mutations or even creates mutations during repair. The mutations can be teratogenic or genetic. Teratogenic mutations are caused by exposure of the fetus in the uterus and affect only the individual who was exposed. Genetic mutations are passed on to offspring.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Non-Stochastic Health Effects<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Non-stochastic effects appear in cases of exposure to high levels of radiation, and become more severe as the exposure increases. Short-term, high-level exposure is referred to as 'acute' exposure.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Many non-cancerous health effects of radiation are non-stochastic. Unlike cancer, health effects from 'acute' exposure to radiation usually appear quickly. Acute health effects include burns and radiation sickness. Radiation sickness is also called 'radiation poisoning.' It can cause premature aging or even death. If the dose is fatal, death usually occurs within two months. The symptoms of radiation sickness include: nausea, weakness, hair loss, skin burns or diminished organ function.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Another thing to understand about why the dose matters is that we are surrounded by ionizing radiation. We always have been. Our bodies have evolved needing to successfully deal with ionizing radiation.

However, in principle, there is no impediment to removing B-cell progenitors in an individual, conditioning them to produce antibodies (which would be an artificial analogue of the natural process of 'Clonal Selection'), and re-injecting these differentiated B-cells into the patient. To my knowledge this process is currently beyond the capacity of our current cell culture techniques, as B-cell differentiation is controlled by an elaborate cell-signaling process, and even if it was feasible, it would remain impractical for several reasons. First, since the B-cell products, antibodies, can be transferred humorally, and should be tolerated by the general population, many existing treatments simply involve injecting antibodies into the patient's bloodstream. Examples of antibodies taken from volunteers' sera are the RhoGam preparations as well as IgG mixtures used to treat certain forms of immunodeficiency. There is a means of growing B-cells in culture to produce antibodies of precise specificity (i.e. monoclonal antibodies - note that clonal selection occurs in a living host for this technique, the B-cells are subsequently harvested then immortalized in culture). Adalimumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is however, very promising work being conducted involving T-cell vaccination, which is technically similar to what you described.

In your body you already have B cells that can recognize the virus and produce antibodies for it. However, there are only a few of these cells for each antibody. Once a particular disease is recognized by these few specific B cells, the B cells turn into plasma cells, clone themselves and start pumping out antibodies.

Perhaps the best way of thinking about antibiotic resistance is not to think of there being 'antibiotic resistance' genes at all, but rather ordinary alleles that are vertically transferred in the typical fashion until at a certain time a deleterious chemical agent is introduced and one specific allele just happens to mitigate the effects of that chemical. It is less a matter of competition than it is of blind chance. Now of course, in principle, the lucky genetic element that will ensure survival may come with an increased energy cost as opposed to the 'wild-type' genome expression, but considering the general mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, one or two extra gene products, maybe a slightly less active enzyme, an extra membrane transporter, the cost is typically not excessive. In culture, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains grow essentially as fast as non-resistant strains. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now concerning the retaining of the resistance after removal of the antibiotic, if the gene is integrated into the genome with the proper regulatory apparatus, it can remain in the species essentially forever. In the case of plasmids or other mobile genetic elements, bacteria do tend to lose these through random processes between divisions, however, many of these elements do have mechanisms to preserve (plasmid addiction) and propagate themselves (horizontal gene transfer). <\/p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to remember about resistance, however, is that only an infinitesimally small proportion of the population actually needs the resistance genetic element to actually start a new resistant population upon antibiotic introduction.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14362,"question_id":14350,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2442ea911c89187262d6575d739a1ca7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5148,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5148/swbarnes2","reputation":1824,"display_name":"swbarnes2"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":14365,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389372974,"comment_id":18982,"body":"Totally agree with the last sentence.

But that was all the way back in the 1950's, what have we learned as the mechanism in 60 years?<\/p>\n\n<h2>Possible Mechanism:<\/h2>\n\n<p>The truth is that we don't have an absolute grasp on how this works when it doesn't cause an autoimmune problem and abort the fetus or even neonate pup.  It's import to note that it probably does cause <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894651/#__ffn_sectitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">auto-immune problems<\/a> and various other side effects (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemartin\" rel=\"nofollow\">like sex differentiation<\/a>) in mammals.<\/p>\n\n<p>But when and how it is tolerated is likely mediated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tolerance#Mechanisms_of_central_tolerance\" rel=\"nofollow\">central tolerance<\/a>, and the ability to get the foreign <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex\" rel=\"nofollow\">MHC molecules<\/a> tolerated by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">early lymphocytes<\/a>.

You should note that this was done with relatively genetically similar animals, and most modern researchers use cells modified from genetically pure mouse breeds.   We also know a lot more on how the cells \"recognize self\" and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">HLA types<\/a> of the population.  <\/p>\n\n<p>You are most likely to succeed when the MHC molecules are very similar (ie from a direct family member).

Generally a bat social call is not tonal, in other words it does not consist of a musical type note. Some bat detectors do not produce an accurate recording of a bat social call. Typically bat social calls use a lower frequency range than echolocation calls, and can thus be heard further away. Sometimes a bat will make a social call while echolocating which can cause confusion.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>We can see and hear how the lower frequency social calls are heard at a greater distance than the higher echolocation calls as the bat approaches and departs. Zooming in on a spectrogram, social calls are atonal and repeated rapidly about five times in each call. The social calls are interleaved between the echolocation calls. They show a ragged frequency distribution around 20 kHz. Note the FD detector divides frequencies by 10.\n  The echolocation calls are single \"hockey stick\" calls at a higher repetition rate. At this scale the hockey stick shape is not very clear, but the end frequency can be measured as 45.2 kHz. A doppler shift is recorded as the bat approaches.

He started out studying the difference between the human gene sequences and <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5382/1432.summary?sid=cd8b6f07-93ad-48da-9026-2b83593009fe\" rel=\"nofollow\">the chimpanzee to try to suss out the specific genes which might be be responsible for out social selves<\/a>.  So from this point of view, it might be that intelligence started at most about the time of human chimp divergence, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee-human_last_common_ancestor\" rel=\"nofollow\">8-25 million years ago<\/a>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Finding the specific genetic structures that convey our unique cognitive or social abilities would certainly pinpoint that time much more accurately.  There is just 1-4% difference between the chimp and human genome sequences (depending on how you calculate it), but even 1% of a 5 Gb genome is a lot of differences and no intelligent mutant chimp has been found (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/\" rel=\"nofollow\">that they've told us about!<\/a>) .  <\/p>\n\n<p>Since then, a lot of interest has focused on assembling a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/nov/16/fossils.research\" rel=\"nofollow\">complete Neanderthal genome sequence<\/a>.  Since Neanderthals diverged from humans about 500k years ago, and there's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_behavior\" rel=\"nofollow\">plenty of evidence<\/a> that they were intelligent, comparing the three genomes (human chimp and neanderthal) would help pinpoint the specific genetic elements which are distinctly human.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If it is a mutation or set of mutations as the current thinking implies, there is a good chance that it is a combination of strong selection and accident.  Its true that cooperation is often enjoys a <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/1419/77\">strong selective advantage<\/a>, but it doesn't make you smart or hospitable.  When we talk in biology we don't say altruism, we say cooperation.  If such cooperation happened only because of selection, we would see such behavior in other primates.  So if we see this, I would lay odds to look for a rather complicated story...<\/p>\n\n<p>Another interesting person to read is anthropologist <a href=\"http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/terrence-w-deacon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terrence Deacon<\/a>, who is trying to understanding the terms with which we define intelligence.  About ten years ago there were actually experiments that showed that chimpanzee some strong candidate intelligence genes related to cognition could be put into people (who needed gene therapy because they had lost cognitive function) and restore that function.  Apologies, this is anecdotal - i saw him give a great talk, but he's moved on a bit and can't find the references.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is important I think because the fundamental definitions of human intelligence have failed over the years, from the old chestnut of <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/new-crow-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">using tools<\/a>, to a <a href=\"http://www.kajama.com/index.php?file=articledetail&amp;id=DC508A2E-0F28-42CA-882B-8B4818CFB53E&amp;PageNum=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">recognition of mortality<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/\" rel=\"nofollow\">to awareness<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jan/11/spindle-cells/\" rel=\"nofollow\">animals have surprised us, particularly primates<\/a>.

It is said that prieshood came to existence, when ape first landed from trees to earth collecting and gathering fruits, hunting and then started to plant and farm. Whole agriculture was build organizating leadership of the society among whom were the priests and shamans who tried to understand natural forces with limited knowledge and superstition. Accelerating need for planning future, not only own family's, but whole society's future forced thinking process of humanized apes to become more involved with contemplating. <em>Did some of the deep thinkers find that there was a dimension on meditation which is next to impression of using herbs and drugs to bring mental experiences, were they hallucinations, visions, calmness or anything similar alive?<\/em> Thus they became ascetics and adept on focusing mind toward itself while other part of high class of the society became adept on aiming mental activity outward, improving skills to master matter and physical nature. On ancient times both still shared same concept of need of supernatural forces to be placated or otherwise controlled to get or avoid certain every day results.<\/p>\n\n<p>This also brings up a huge evolutionary problem so to say. While apes, if they were just lead by rather unconscious instincts, they would have reproduced and build on the principle of the strongest is the leader. But when reasoning, ability to think \"cunning plans\" as stated by Baldric on Blackadder came to existence, then the most clever often won the game. But what is clever on the other extreme of the religious practice, self sacrificing and altruistic ethics? It feels almost unnatural, that religions evolved to direction, where ethic and moral rules fights against physical existence or surveillance of the individual. There is a strong hope of afterlife compensation, which explains some of it, but I'm still a bit struggled, <strong>why (and when) apes started to retire to the forests to meditate and rather practice altruistic ethics, loving enemies for example instead of getting justice and their own benefit fulfilled in first hand, instead of reproducing and fighting for their lives and space?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To bring whole question to modern life, I think zen buddhism is a good example of such practices brought to other level. While on the most plain form they don't expect belief on the existence of the self nor karmic relations of the acts, they still rather follow high ethics of the teachings of Buddha and live simple middle way life just being aware and mindfull of the things happening at the moment, which is the ultimate goal of the practice and life.<\/p>\n","question_id":2442,"tags":["human-biology","neuroscience","zoology","physiology","history"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":2443,"down_vote_count":2,"closed_reason":"off topic","is_answered":true,"view_count":299,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user1897"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"score":0,"post_id":5728,"edited":false,"creation_date":1357844906,"comment_id":8244,"body":"This is a philosophical question, not biological.

For all we know, they way they sense depth and up and down might be completely different. The representation of colour could be completely different. Both individuals could explain it as images, but if it were possible to move another individuals representation into another individuals brain - it's likely the other individual would experience an abstract sensation that would be difficult to compare to anything else that individual has experienced.<\/p>\n\n<p>It could well be like having a compass attached to your body, sending nerve signals to your brain. You would not understand how to interpret it unless your brain has plenty of time to associate the stream of signals of direction with other signals such as your balance, vision and audio.<\/p>\n\n<p>The brain is a very complex organ, and it probably starts out like a tiny, one celled blank sheet of paper. That blank sheet of paper is receiving continous streams of electronic signals from the various sensory organs of the body. Over time, synapses between your neurons will bond with other synapses, due to both of them receiving signals simultaneously. For example, if you are listening to music, you will hear various frequencies. Usually there will be a drum beat, which you will also sense as vibrations in the floor and your stomach. The neurons handling those two different signals will then bond together, so that at a later time - when you sense bass signals in the floor, but not in your stomach and by your ears - your brain will still recognize that drum beat in the floor as music. Some people might even feel like they hear the music.<\/p>\n\n<p>The nerves are then going from the sensor to the brain in various ways and paths, and those connections are different for everybody. <\/p>\n\n<p>Your brain will visualize stuff your way, and other people will visualize stuff their way and I believe those representations of objects and things are completely different for everybody. The representations will be compatible among different people, in such a way that physical laws are obeyed - but that is because the brain alters representations according to previous experiences.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, knowing that it is impossible to be sure, I really do believe that everybody represents sensations completely different. They will be handled in similar regions of the brain due to physical similarities of the body, but within those regions in the brain there will be huge differences in representations.<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe that if a human, unknowingly had a compass operated into his body at birth and connected to an arbitrary nerve, then that human would experience a heightened sense of direction that it could not explain as an adult. If another human had an identical compass attached to a completely different part of his body and connected to perhaps the nerve going from one of the ears, then that human would experience the same sense of direction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer; I am a computer programmer with a keen interest in virtualized intelligence - I have no education in the area of biology. :-)<\/p>\n","answer_id":14311,"question_id":5728,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5728/how-can-you-test-what-color-different-people-perceive","last_activity_date":1389096272,"creation_date":1357760371,"answer_count":3,"title":"How can you test what color different people perceive?","body":"<p>If I would show someone a yellow object and ask them, \"is this object yellow?\"\n That person would say \"yes\".<\/p>\n\n<p>But I could never know if my perception of the color yellow is the same as that other person's.<br>\nBecause he or she could actually be seeing, what I know to be the color green.<br>\nBut then tells me that its the color yellow because that has been taught to him or her from young age.<\/p>\n\n<p>So how can you test if people are really seeing the same color?<br>\n(originally posted this question on physics.stackexchange but was advised to try it here)\n<a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/48731/how-can-you-test-what-color-different-people-perceive\">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/48731/how-can-you-test-what-color-different-people-perceive<\/a><\/p>\n","question_id":5728,"tags":["perception"],"score":7,"accepted_answer_id":5731,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":573,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1357844920},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":14289,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389013993,"comment_id":18768,"body":"Normally , tumor cells are destroyed by NK cells.

This chromosome was discovered in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford, and it is a fusion of parts of DNA from chromosome 22 and chromosome 9. The broken end of chromosome 22 contains the \"BCR\" gene, which fuses with a fragment of chromosome 9 that contains the \"ABL1\" gene. When these two chromosome fragments fuse the genes also fuse creating a new gene: \"BCR-ABL\". This fused gene encodes for a protein that displays high protein tyrosine kinase activity (this activity is due to the \"ABL1\" half of the protein). The unregulated expression of this protein activates other proteins that are involved in cell cycle and cell division which can cause a cell to grow and divide uncontrollably (the cell becomes cancerous).

For example, if the drug is supposed to decrease blood thickness, then a measure of the drug's efficacy is a measurement of change in blood thickness upon application of a given concentration of drug. So I'll focus on the case of analgesics, since that's the context of your original question.<\/p>\n\n<p>While I can't say for sure how this particular quantity was measured, it appears that the effect of analgesics like morphine or enkephalins is measured by direct measurements of pain under different administered concentrations of drug. This can be done in animal or human studies. In animal studies, varying concentrations of a drug are administered, and then the response of the animal to different pain stimuli is recorded. One common example of a pain measurement is a hot plate, where the animal's foot is placed on a hot plate and the time until it tries to remove its foot is measured. <\/p>\n\n<p>These studies can also be done in humans. In this study <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2001&amp;issue=07000&amp;article=00009&amp;type=abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1)<\/a>, the effect of a particular drug was measured by different tests, including <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>electrical shocks of increasing intensity; maximum intensity of pain subject wanted to endure was measured.<\/li>\n<li>pressure applied to the finger: maximum pressure subject wanted to endure was measured.<\/li>\n<li>heat applied to the forearm (maximum tolerable temperature measured)<\/li>\n<li>dominant hand immersed in ice water for up to 2 minutes. Subjects continually reported level of pain on a 0-10 scale, sum of all pain levels over course of experiment was used as measurement of total pain endured.<\/li>\n<li>Tourniquet applied to cut off blood supply for up to 2 minutes, pain measured in same way as above.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If these pain measurements are recorded when the patient has different levels of the drug in their system, then comparing drug effects amounts to identifying the concentration of drug at which a particular pain response is achieved. In other words<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Drug A is X times more <em>powerful<\/em> than drug B if drug A causes the same effect on pain response (measured in some way like the ones measured before) as drug B at X times lower concentration.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As a side note, the initial thought I had was that this might be measured by quantifying the receptor-ligand affinity of the various drugs for the pain receptors (opioid receptors) in the nervous system. In that situation, saying that drug A was 200 times more powerful than drug B would amount to saying that A's affinity (or Kd) for a particular receptor was 200 times greater than B. Or something along those lines (see the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_%28biochemistry%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">receptor-ligand interactions<\/a>). That would be a 'universal' way to measure drug efficacies, since a large number of drugs work by blocking certain receptors in the brain. But biology is too complicated to permit a straightforward relationship between binding affinity and perceived drug effect.

A specific answer might be possible, but I doubt there will be any existing experiments that address this. With the obvious caveat that only experimental or statistical results can really answer your question, here are a couple of off-the-cuff hypothesis for consideration:<\/p>\n\n<p>1 - Differences in stem cell populations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently, differentiation can actually be targeted as part of a treatment in some neuroblastoma cases - see the section on \"Differentiation therapy\" in <a href=\"http://www.mskcc.org/pediatrics/childhood/neuroblastoma/treatment\">this page from Sloan-Kettering<\/a>. Cardiac stem cells <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16050255\">seem to exist<\/a>, but a difference in relative population and turnover rates between brain and heart might be related to the relative frequencies of these types of cancers. @WYSYWIG referred to neural progenitors in his comment above.<\/p>\n\n<p>2 - A filtering effect due to a more extreme selection pressure in the uniformly stressful environment of the a beating heart.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although there is a relation between elevated levels of oxidative stress and cancer causing mutations, it could be that this only matters in a punctuated stress environment, where cells have down time to recover. A sustained stress environment might actually helps prevent cancer. The path from normal to cancer cell <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/milestones/milecancer/full/milecancer14.html\">requires multiple mutations<\/a>, and I would not expect most pre-cancerous cells to be more fit than correctly wired ones. The extra stress of the cardiac environment might produce an elevated mutation rate, but also produce an even higher rate of apoptosis in early \"sick\" cells before they accumulate enough mistakes to become become cancerous, resulting in a net decrease in the rate of cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of these ideas fit with heart cancer being less common and with metastasis from elsewhere being more common in heart than primary cancer, but unfortunately, a higher rate of clearing of sick cells would necessitate a higher rate of replacement from stem cells, so these two hypotheses partially cancel each other. Again, hypotheses without experiments are not really answers.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13456,"question_id":10809,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10809/extremely-rare-occurence-of-heart-cancer","last_activity_date":1388889877,"creation_date":1381376729,"answer_count":1,"title":"Extremely rare occurence of Heart cancer?","body":"<p>The occurrence of Heart cancer (similar, but not the same as Rhabdomyosarcoma) is extremely rare, about 1 per year according to <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heart-cancer/AN01288\">MayoClinic<\/a>. The reason for this rarity is explained to be the post-mitotic nature of cardiac muscles. Since they stop dividing early in the life cycle of humans and grow only by increasing in volume, they are very less prone to oncogenic activation events caused due to mutation as a result of an error in DNA replication (since they do not replicate their DNA as they do not divide).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Although I am not an expert in tumours and cancers, I think that malignant tumours in nervous tissue, i.e. brain tumours are fairly common, at least more common than heart cancer by several orders of magnitude. But neurons constituting these tissues are also permanently in interphase and hence do not divide. \n Moreover, secondary malignancies in Brain and nervous tissue is also much more common than secondaries in heart (rare) though metastatic secondary tumours, I believe, do not require oncogenic transformations in the host tissue.
