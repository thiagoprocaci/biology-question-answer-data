Smoking decreases cell division, thereby smoking decreases risk of cancer. Furthermore, stopping smoking increases growth rates, thus there's an immediate rise in risk following smoking cessation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cancer is NOT caused by cell division. Smoking does NOT cause cancer by cell division. That's the flaw in your argument. What's happening is that cell division ISN'T being controlled. Let's propose that smoking does indeed stunt normal cell growth. The carcinogens in tar from smoking are still floating around causing mutations in the DNA. Most of DNA doesn't code for very much, but some parts of it codes for genes which control cell division. If these genes mutate then cell division is no longer controlled by these genes and hence there's uncontrolled cell division a.k.a cancer. Once these cells are dividing in an uncontrolled fashion, smoking isn't going to limit their growth. That's because this cancer has developed in the presence of these toxins that limit it's growth and despite this it's still managed to occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>And then that cell growth stunting may actually be causing cancer to occur. White blood cell function is impaired by smoking, these cells usually target cancerous cells and destroy them. Without being destroyed, there's a higher chance of cancer. <\/p>\n\n<p>And then I could go further, usually cells grow older and die. Maybe smoking by stunting growth of these cells leads to cells that last longer than they should.

I see a number of misconceptions here:\nFirst you assume, that a slower cell division is something you want to have. Most cell of the adult human body do no divide at all (or only at relatively low rates). Some cells have higher proliferation rates belong to the hematopoietic system, the gut, the mucosas of the body and the skin. These cells need to be able to proliferate in order to fulfill their function. Other cells are dividing to replace cells which went into apoptosis or had to be replaced, but this can not be compared like the growing rates of kids.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, cell growth is highly restricted and controlled for good reasons. I did a short search for articles describing slower cell growth by smoking. What I found does not favor the idea that slowed cell growth might be beneficial. This paper for example (\"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643295/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cigarette Smoke Induces Cellular Senescence<\/a>\"), shows that lung fibroblasts are going into senescence and are not able to do necessary proliferation for lung maintanence. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then, even if cancer is defined (among other things) to be a fast proliferating, uncontrolled growing mass of cells, its not enough to simply let cells grow, to be able to call them cancer cells. To be able to grow as a cancer cell, the cell needs to change genetically and pick up a number of mutations which allows them to escape the security programs of the body. These are apoptosis and the immune system and its not an easy task. Most cells with the potential to become cancer cells get caught on the way. For the way, how cells become cancer cells, this <a href=\"http://lungcancer.about.com/od/Biology-of-Cancer/a/Cancer-Cells-Normal-Cells.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage<\/a> is pretty interesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stopping to smoke does not cause more problems for you body, it reduces them.

I cannot argue against that, for the evidence in favor appears strong, and the evidence against is lacking. I'll happily sit here and agree that smoking increases the risk of cancer.

This will likely be some scale and will gradually decrease to somewhere near 0.<\/p>\n\n<p>Further to this, the risk of cancer is not directly related to the lung, but it is believed to be caused by chemicals entering through the lung into the blood, and travelling around the body, causing cancer in various organs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider that the cell growth is probably linked (in the lung, at least) to chemicals \"surrounding\" the existing cells, this explains why smokers run short of breath. This partially explains the growth stunt side of smoking. Perhaps this happens body-wide, I don't know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then consider what will happen when one stops smoking. The cell growth rate will begin to radically and unexpected increase as the growth stunt is suspended, meanwhile chemicals will still exist in the blood and organs which will be perverting cell growth causing mutant (cancerous) cells. At this point the body is unprepared and settled into its routine of slowly generating cells, but now it is generating them faster and is struggling to keep up. Energy is lacking in areas, and there is further cause of mutant cells to grow and even to be allowed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Surely, given this reasoning, it might be understandable that stopping smoking increases the immediate risk of cancer, though reducing the long term risk?<\/p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know, or can anybody find reasonable proof that any part of this argument is flawed? Is there any research to suggest that there is or is not an immediate increased risk? The one thing that people never mention in the side-effects of quitting is the risk of immediate body failure through a variety of means (I've known people to come with flu-like symptoms then find they have cancer weeks later).

However, <strong>There is currently no standard annotation nomenclature for gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations in metabolic models, and in general only direct GPR associations are encoded in model files.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming that you have a metabolic model in SBML format (for example the RECON 2 model), reactions may have a gene association and/or be associated with an Enzyme Comission (EC) Number.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a> However, several model reactions catalyzed by distinct isozymes (different enzymes catalyzing the same reaction) may be associated with the same EC number, and many reactions may not be annotated with an EC association. Therefore you might want to use the gene associations directly. Both gene associations and EC numbers are recorded in the \"notes\" tag for each reaction in the SBML file, and is not part of the SBML specification. (A proposal has been published for improving support for gene associations in the SBML format.<a href=\"http://figshare.com/articles/Proposal_Encoding_Gene_Protein_Associations_in_SBML/855490\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<h2>Using EC numbers:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Using EC numbers is the simplest, but not the most precise or possibly even usable solution. It is simpler than using gene associations, because genes may described using any of a number of identifiers depending on the database while any reaction is associated with at most one EC number. Once you know the target protein, you can look it up in the UniProt database, and find its EC number (if any) in the field \"protein names\". A simple example: The DrugBank entry for the cancer drug Fluorouracil (<a href=\"http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00544\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00544<\/a>), links to the UniProt entry for one of its targets, Thymidylate synthase (<a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04818\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04818<\/a>), where the EC number is given as 2.1.1.45. Searching the RECON 2 SBML file (or searching in BiGG at <a href=\"http://bigg.ucsd.edu/bigg/main.pl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bigg.ucsd.edu/bigg/main.pl<\/a>) for occurences of this number will show that it is associated with the \"TMDS\" reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The IUPHAR database (<a href=\"http://www.iuphar-db.org/index.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.iuphar-db.org/index.jsp<\/a>) may also be useful. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Using Gene associations:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Genes are conceptually at least one step removed from the reactions their products catalyze, so one might argue that using EC numbers which actually correspond to reactions would be better. However, it is thinkable that a drug might affect only one of several enzymes which catalyze the same reaction and thus share an EC number. Furthermore,  annotation of reactions with EC numbers in metabolic models may be poor. Thus you may want to use gene associations to determine which reaction are affected by a drug.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, due to the large number of databases, a single gene may be described using many identifiers or symbols in different databases. You thus have to identify the gene coding for the product which is the target of the drug, and obtain the correct identifier for that gene which corresponds to the nomenclature used in the model.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming again that you are using the RECON 2 model, it is an update of RECON1 which was made using the BiGG database<a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/213\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>. Gene protein reaction (GPR) associations are therefore recorded using the gene names in BiGG. When ignoring the decimal and any following numbers, BiGG gene names <em>appear<\/em> to correspond to Gene IDs in the NCBI Gene database.<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a> A question on how to identify BiGG reactions  was also discussed at BioStar.<a href=\"http://www.biostars.org/p/9047/\" rel=\"nofollow\">6<\/a> However, you have the opposite problem: Finding a BiGG gene name from another gene identifier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using Fluorouracil as an example again, the DrugBank entry lists \"Cytochrome P450 2C9\" as a targeted enzyme, with the effect being inhibition. Following the link to the UniProt entry P11712 (<a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11712\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11712<\/a>), we find that it has an EC number 1.14.13.- However, this EC number corresponds to a <em>class<\/em> of reactions (or rather, enzymes). There are also listed several additional EC number at the single reaction level, but as these may not cover or be associated with all relevant reactions, we'll use the gene association. Going back to the DrugBank entry (or just reading on the UniProt page), we find that the gene name is CYP2C9. Looking up this name at a suitable database, for example the HGNC database of human gene names at <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.genenames.org/<\/a>, we find the entry for CYP2C9 (<a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?hgnc_id=2623\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?hgnc_id=2623<\/a>) and that its Entrez Gene ID is 1559. Searching for this gene identifier in the BiGG database, we find that four reactions are associated with this identifier (The actual association is to \"1559.1\"): P4502C9,P4502C92,P4502C93 and P4502C94. Note that none of these reactions have an associated EC number.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Defining your own GPR associations<\/h2>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that even in genome-scale metabolic models, a large number of reactions and processes are missing. While the term metabolism in its widest sense may be used to refer to <strong>all<\/strong> reactions occuring in a cell, metabolic models have so far been mostly limited to covering transport and inter-conversions of small metabolites. Processes involving signalling molecules and regulation of enzymes have been mostly or completely left out, along with critical processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair and apoptosis.  Because of the limited scope of the models, gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relations do not generally take regulatory effects into account, being limited to describing direct relations between one or more genes encoding (part of) a protein which directly catalyzes a reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>One could also model a very large number of <em>indirect<\/em> regulatory effects, but as current metabolic models generally do not specify these, you may have to construct them yourself. To find reactions in a metabolic model which are affected by a certain drug, you may have to \"travel\" several steps of interactions from the original target of the drug. You may consider using protein-protein-interaction network (PIN) data to help in this. You will have to consider the strength/importance of the interactions, something which may require a high degree of manual curation.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, if your drug affects HSP90, which is needed for correct folding of certain enzymes, you may consider creating a GPR stating that the gene for HSP90 (or rather, HSP90 itself) is needed for any reactions catalyzed by a specific enzyme to be active. This would be an indirect GPR, as HSP90 does not itself produce any part of the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction. As an alternative to on/off regulation through a GPR, you may consider searching for data on the ratio of correctly folded and misfolded enzymes in the presence and absence of HSP90, and apply bounds on reactions catalyzed by the affected enzyme to reflect this. <\/p>\n","answer_id":15196,"question_id":14940,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14940/how-to-relate-human-metabolic-model-reactions-and-cancer-drug-targets-reactome","last_activity_date":1392932963,"creation_date":1392020212,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to relate human metabolic model reactions and cancer drug targets / reactome items?","body":"<p>Trying to find a way to take a cancer drug (from CancerDR, for instance) and infer the metabolic reactions that are affected by it in the Human Metabolic Model.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, I would like to know which HMM reactions are affected by a certain cancer therapy drug, especially the ones found in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Searching for the reactions that are associated with the <code>HSP90<\/code> protein, which is targeted (to some extent) by the <code>17-AAG<\/code> agent.

The solution of this problem is the Theory of Musical Equilibration. It says that music can't convey any emotion at all, but merely volitional processes, the music listener identifies with. Then in the process of identifying the volitional processes are colored with emotions. The same happens when we watch an exciting film and identify with the volitional processes of our favourite figures. Here, too, just the process of identification generates emotions.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example: If you perceive a major chord, you normally identify with the will \"Yes, I want to...\". The experience of listening to a minor chord can be compared to the message conveyed when someone says, \"No more.\" If someone were to say these words slowly and quietly, they would create the impression of being sad, whereas if they were to scream it quickly and loudly, they would be come across as furious. This distinction also applies for the emotional character of a minor chord: if a minor harmony is repeated faster and at greater volume, its sad nature appears to have suddenly turned into fury. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because this detour of emotions via volitional processes was not detected, also all music psychological and neurological experiments, to answer the question of the origin of the emotions in the music, failed.<\/p>\n\n<p>But how music can convey volitional processes? These volitional processes have something to do with the phenomena which early music theorists called \"lead\", \"leading tone\" or \"striving effects\". If we reverse this musical phenomena in imagination into its opposite (not the sound wants to change - but the listener identifies with a will not to change the sound) we have found the contents of will, the music listener identifies with. In practice, everything becomes a bit more complicated, so that even more sophisticated volitional processes can be represented musically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Further information is available via the free download of <em>my<\/em> e-book \"<a href=\"http://www.willimekmusic.de/music-and-emotions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Music and Emotion - Research on the Theory of Musical Equilibration<\/a>\"<\/p>\n\n<p>or on the online journal <a href=\"http://www.eunomios.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">EUNOMIOS<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15148,"question_id":13810,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1392902438}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13810/chills-down-the-spine-with-certain-music","last_activity_date":1392902438,"creation_date":1386198046,"answer_count":2,"title":"Chills down the spine with certain music?","body":"<p>I am sure many of us know the feeling of that tingling chill down our spines when listening to certain music. <\/p>\n\n<p>I experienced this most when my younger brother played an emotional piano piece for a talent show (brought me to tears). <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What causes that? <\/li>\n<li>Is music the only stimulus to elicit that spine-tingling? <\/li>\n<li>And in terms of evolution, why?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","question_id":13810,"tags":["human-biology","neuroscience","behaviour","sensation","hearing"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":13815,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":158,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1387246708},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJ9Cr.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5796,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5796/diamond-louis-xiv","reputation":5,"display_name":"Diamond Louis XIV"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUToS.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3971,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3971/atl-led","reputation":3371,"display_name":"Atl LED","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":15168,"edited":false,"creation_date":1392870907,"comment_id":20294,"body":"You might want to begin to look at ion pumps and channels (plenty of good wiki articles).

So, for example, the codons UUU and UUC both encode for phenylalanine but - I'm making this up - UUU is common in human but rare in coli while UUC the contrary.

The insulin peptide, for example, once synthetized is cleaved by specific peptidases and disulfide bonds are formed.

Instead of trying to exactly reproduce the protein with all its modifications, often people search for functionally (and not structurally) identical proteins.<\/li>\n<li>Also the <strong>folding process<\/strong> can be different, both assisted (by chaperones) and spontaneous (withouth chaperones).

When growing bacterial cells growing in culture evolve under selection pressure for biomass production, the theoretical limit on biomass production may indeed be approached, see for example Ibarra et al: <em>Nature. 2002 Nov 14;420(6912):186-9<\/em>. (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12432395\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12432395<\/a>) and Fong &amp; Palsson: <em>Nat Genet. 2004 Oct;36(10):1056-8<\/em> (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15448692\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15448692<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>How closely other systems can be expected to approach optimality should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and the constraints should be realistic. In humans, you would for example expect that the physiology of the persons (blood glucose levels, etc.) would greatly affect the growth rate of any cancer cells, in addition to the structure of the tumour (especially blood supply). For cells growing freely in culture, one might expect FBA to be easier to apply.<\/p>\n\n<p>For HeLa cells growing in culture, the results of at least one study suggests agreement between experimental and FBA-predicted growth rates: See Resendis-Antonio et al: <em>Modeling core metabolism in cancer cells: surveying the topology underlying the Warburg effect.

See below for references.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two approaches to estimating internal metabolic fluxes: The (primarily) experimental and the (primarily) computational. I say primarily, because even for the experimental approach, a large amount of computation need to be done, and for the computational approach, experimental studies must be consulted in order to set realistic model parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Experimental determination of internal metabolic fluxes has been centered around 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) performed through carbon-labelling experiments, as mentioned above. 13C-MFA is complicated and expensive, so there is a relative lack of experimental data, and most experiments cover only a few fluxes when compared to the number of possible reactions, typically several thousand in genome-scale metabolic models. In 13C-MFA, most experiments estimate the fluxes in a much smaller model (for example the central carbon metabolism), avoiding or ignoring other possible reactions, and the set of fluxes that are estimated varies between experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Models which are used in computational approaches to flux analysis are typically larger than the models used in 13C-MFA experiments, and thus it is usually not possible to determine all the fluxes from experimental data alone. Thus, an approach called constraint-based modelling (COBRA) is mainly used. The basic assumption of most current flux analysis methods, both experimental and computational, is that metabolite concentrations are at steady state. Mathematically, this can be described by the equation<\/p>\n\n<p>$S\\overrightarrow v  = 0$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $S$ is a <em>stoichiometric matrix<\/em> relating the metabolites and all possible reactions (basically a compact description of the metabolic model), and $\\overrightarrow v$ is the <em>flux vector<\/em> containing all the flux values. In addition to the steady state requirement, constraints are typically applied to the uptake and excretion rates of various metabolites, limiting them to biologically realistic values. Other requirements, such as requirements for ATP maintenance consumption can also be applied.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because there are typically many possible flux patterns that obey the above constraints, a principle is needed for selecting a biologically realistic solution from the solution space of feasible flux patterns. Assuming that cells optimize their metabolic patterns in some way, different <em>objective functions<\/em> are used that attempt to capture the metabolic behaviour for cells. Once an objective function is chosen, the set of possible solutions can be searched for the flux pattern that gives the highest objective value as a function of the flux vector. Given that the objective is linear (simply a weighed sum of fluxes), an optimal solution can be found rapidly. <strong>In general, many different optimal solutions may exist for a given objective function.<\/strong> The method of applying an objective function to a constrained metabolic model at steady state is called Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).<\/p>\n\n<p>The most basic and a popular objective is maximization of biomass production. While useful for determining maximal growth rates, <strong>this objective is unlikely to be realistic when applied to human cells.<\/strong> FBA and related methods is generally well-suited to determining performance limits for single endpoints such as growth rate or production of a single metabolite, but not capable of precisely determining all internal metabolic fluxes. The point that many optimal solutions may exist for a single objective function is important in this regard.<\/p>\n\n<p>As 13C-MFA and FBA are based on the same concept of metabolite balancing, they can be viewed as different ends of the same spectrum, from purely experimental to purely computational, with 13C-MFA constrained FBA (where 13C-MFA results is used to constrain the possible fluxes in a model before optimizing an objective function, or minimizing the difference between the experimental fluxes and the FBA solution, subject to additional constraints) in the middle.<\/p>\n\n<p>For an introduction to Flux Balance Analysis, see  Orth, Thiele &amp; Palsson: <em>\"What is flux balance analysis?\" Nature Biotechnology 28 245-48 2010.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>For performing Flux Balance Analysis, several software packages are available. One of the most used is the COBRA Toolbox for Matlab. A version for Python called CobraPy is also under development. Both are available at <a href=\"http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/openCOBRA/Welcome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/openCOBRA/Welcome.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Note that most gene-expression data only shows relative changes in expression between two conditions. Most methods are thus based on comparing two different conditions. More recently, RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) may also be used to obtain more direct measures of gene expression levels. Many extensions and variations on FBA have been published which take into account gene expression. Some of these are regulatory FBA (rFBA, Covert &amp; Palsson: <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2002 277, 28058-28064<\/em>), Metabolic Adjustment by Differential Expression (MADE, Jensen &amp; Papin: <em>Bioinformatics. 2011 Feb 15;27(4):541-7<\/em> ) and iMAT (Schlomi et al:  <em>Bioinformatics (2010) 26 (24): 3140-3142<\/em>.). For a more recent method, gx-FBA (gene expression-FBA), see *Navid &amp; Almaas, BMC Systems Biology 2012, 6:150). <\/p>\n\n<p>You may also want to read this article which deals with construction tissue-specific metabolic models: <em>Computational reconstruction of tissue-specific metabolic models: application to human liver metabolism. Mol Syst Biol. 2010 Sep 7;6:401. doi: 10.1038/msb.2010.56.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The problem with using FBA and related methods to estimate internal fluxes is that validation of the results is difficult because of the mentioned lack of experimental data. I wrote a project report on the topic during the last year of my Master's, which includes a basic description of 13C-MFA.

I hope the following will help a bit.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd like to pinpoint what seems to me to be one important mistake in your text. Reading you we have the feeling that selection acts on wires so to select the best combination. If this is what you meant, then it is obviously wrong. The thing is that the change that get inherited are alleles. An allele is a variant of a gene. For example: gene codes for eyes color. A bi-allelic gene has an allele which codes for blue eyes while the other codes for brown eyes. Assuming that there is genetic variance underlying the wire connection variance in the population, then yes selection will select for the best genetic variant. This does not necessarily mean that this best genetic variant is the most optimal possible to imagine solution. The most optimal allele might have never been created just because of the randomness nature of mutations.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT:<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do natural selection always bring a particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotypic<\/a> (loosly speaking, phenotype = morphological) trait to its optimal state?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No! It does not.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The main reason is that the genetic variant coding for this optimal trait does not necessarily exist because of the randomness of mutational process. Also, because of the metabolic pathway bringing some variance to a trait, it is often very hard to even imagine a  mutation that would allow creating a new, more optimal, phenotypic variant. So indeed developmental biology has to be taken in account to.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Because in absence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift<\/a> (infinite population), selection can only bring genotypes uphill in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape\" rel=\"nofollow\">fitness landscape<\/a>. If a very high peak exist somewhere in the fitness landscape but in order to reach such peak, 10 mutations are needed were all of them in any other genetic background are deleterious (correspond to valleys in fitness landscape), then the optimal high will probably never be reached (except if all 10 mutations appear suddenly in the same individual).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Because selection might be weaker than genetic drift. Also, different subpopulations might be in different environments were different traits correspond to optimal traits and because of migration (gene flow) between subpopulations, it is possible that no optimal phenotypic trait can be ever seen although all the genotypic variance exist.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The seemingly most optimal trait might actually not be really optimal. For example: Peripheral vision might be limited by the brain rather than by the eye because it would be an important energy cost for the brain to process more information, a cost that might outweight the benefit of having a better peripheral vision.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":15037,"question_id":15029,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1392378952}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15029/evolution-self-organization-and-neuroscience","last_activity_date":1392378952,"creation_date":1392351321,"answer_count":1,"title":"Evolution, self organization and neuroscience","body":"<p>I have rudimentary knowledge of evolution, and biology in general, so bear with me if this question is a bit naive. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let's say we have a particular trait, like highly sensitive peripheral vision. There are two ways to go about explaining how this came about: <\/p>\n\n<p>One is to say that evolution selected for it over time, because animals with a poor sensitivity to peripheral activity could easily become prey. So there is an advantage to having sensitive peripheral vision, and such a trait is <em>adaptive<\/em>. The picture I have in my mind is of an assembly line where there are randomly wired visual cortices and the best ones get selected for automatically. This seems to be the view of the field of evolutionary algorithms, at least to my mind.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if we focus on the random nature of the wiring, we might see that there is an explosion of possibilities in terms of how the visual system can be wired together. After all, evolution is blind, and it doesn't know beforehand which physical signals are of interest. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to think of a more plausible mechanistic explanation. Suppose we <strong>assume<\/strong> that given certain reliable properties of the physical world, like permanence of objects for example, evolution has found the optimal way to wire the visual cortex so that peripheral vision (and a host of other good-to-have features) is a natural outcome, then it would give us more focus in what environmental features and algorithms to look for. This can also be thought of as the idea that evolution, over time, has come to assume that certain things in the physical world will be a given and exploits these. (For example, objects in the peripheral areas of vision will tend to have different perceived velocities, so perhaps normalizing velocities across the field of vision automatically results in a need for higher sensitivity in that region. It just so happens that this could also be useful in detecting predators).<\/p>\n\n<p>My question then is, is my assumption in the above paragraph valid?

The same mechanism I talk about in moulding antigens below. It is exactly what it says: a high rate of mutation compared to that of the low rate in cells normally. When B cells are activated because they've met their antigen to which they respond (<strong>cognate antigen<\/strong>), they undergo somatic hypermutation. While the B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, the genes which code for the antibody are mutated so that the antibody binds to its cognate antigen with a different specificity. If it binds better the B cell gets to live, if it doesn't bind or it is worse then the B cell dies.   <\/p>\n\n<h2>Moulding antigens<\/h2>\n\n<p>What we cannot do is the other way around. We can't recognise an antigen and then make an antibody to it, because recognising the antigen requires an antibody. What we can do is once we've recognised the antigen, then mould the antibody so it is a better fit. How we do this is by B cells mutating their antibodies and competing which binds better. However, B cells just don't have the knowledge to see an antigen and think a tyrosine residue at this position will be perfect to change my shape to this configuration - that's really complex stuff!<\/p>\n\n<h2>Do antibodies recognise every molecule?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Antibodies are made to essentially every antigen which is very costly in terms of energy as you mentioned. In fact, the number of genes that make antibodies are thought to be the perfect amount as to protect us without being too numerous so that it is not only too costly, but we have so many different antibodies the chance of ever finding the right B cell is so low we die before we manage. This is because of the way antibodies are mass produced, in the typical pathway of new antigens, firstly a T cell must recognise the antigen then B cells that produce an antibody that binds to the antigen (rarely in the same region, and may not even be to a protein antigen). <\/p>\n\n<p>So these two paragraphs highlight the limitations and answer your first question. Antibodies are so diverse that we can expect quite a few to recognise every pathogen, but not every single possible antigen will have a cognate antibody. Diversity without so much diversity that it becomes redundant. The second limitation is that antibodies will ideally not form if they recognise self (our own proteins etc.) Which leads on to your next question. <\/p>\n\n<h2>What if a pathogen makes antigens that look like our own proteins?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Autoantibodies are made but are typically non-pathogenic (i.e., they don't cause harm). Certain HLA/MHC polymorphisms that make us likely to form autoreactive T cells, also make us make autoreactive antibodies. Interestingly, this increases our risk of autoimmune diabetes but ALSO makes us more resistant to infection by HIV. This can be practically seen in the DQ8 polymorphism. This is a perfect example to illustrate the answer to your second question. Ideally, pathogens which have antigens similar to our own would not be detected. HIV wraps itself with an envelope of our own lipid membrane for this purpose, and the best neutralising antibodies are often self-reactive and therefore are those that failed elimination. <\/p>\n\n<p>However even these pathogens are going to do something or make something that isn't something our cells usually do. This is how the body finds and targets cancer cells (in a way), they do things our own cells won't typically do like make the wrong proteins or wrong amounts etc. Thus cancer cells and pathogens can be targeted by our cells that find something that isn't self (CD8 cytotoxic/killer T cells). As for pathogens, we all make MHC/HLA which is unique to us and pathogens could never manage to invade and make the specific HLA/MHC that we do, so our body also targets missing HLA/MHC. <\/p>\n","answer_id":8691,"question_id":8684,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1392215323}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8684/do-we-have-enough-diversity-of-antibodies-to-overcome-almost-any-antigen","last_activity_date":1392215323,"creation_date":1370662978,"answer_count":2,"title":"Do we have enough diversity of antibodies to overcome almost any antigen?","body":"<p>I always wonder about the capability of diversity of our antibodies.

This could be a result of increased friction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The third is apparently controversial although it seems perfectly reasonable and highly likely to me. There is <a href=\"http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/mhc_mate_preference_smell_t_shirts.pdf\">a famous experiment<\/a> by Claus Wedekind who got men to wear a t-shirt for a few days. He then got women to choose a most preferred male purely by the scent of the t-shirt and found interesting results relating to the MHC profiles. The armpit hair could help to trap the odour produced by the sweat and help with mate attraction, like some kind of scent sponge. I don't understand why this is so controversial, loads of animals influence mate choice with scent - perhaps people don't like to think we are genetically attracted to each other by sweat because it seems animalistic and less romantic.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, there is no sure answer and it could well be all of the above, or something entirely different.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5247,"question_id":5217,"up_vote_count":17,"last_edit_date":1353324605},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78eddc23a804daee094d68d2b2d1320b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1688,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1688/stuart-r-jefferys","reputation":431,"display_name":"Stuart R.

Perhaps, but its really not clear.  Is the function of SIRT1 primarily to mediate low calorie response? Absolutely not.  What does that mean for SIRT2/SIR2 - its probably not more closely associated with calorie restriction signals, though it might be connected in a similar ambiguous way... but see below. <\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly SIRT1 has also been shown to have <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/604479\" rel=\"nofollow\">many influences in many studies<\/a> of conditions such as Alzheimers, anxiety and other neuro-functions.  SIRT1 modifies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53\" rel=\"nofollow\">p53<\/a> - a bottleneck in cellular reproduction and a key regulator in cancer prevention, but which also an important aspect as to why it is active in calorie restriction conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>When reading reference like the one you have here its important to remember that correlation is not causality.  Very few genes in animals function only when specific behavior or conditions are experienced, especially signaling genes.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Examining the OMIM report (see link above) there has been a close examination of the possible role of SIRT1 in calorie restriction since the early 2000s in knockout mice. <\/p>\n\n<p>SIRT1 would seem to play an important role in embryonic development for instance - cell growth is so important at that point and 80% of mice who are homozygous SIRT1 (-/-) knockouts die before they are born and even more die in the early natal period.  The mice who do survive have problems generating red blood cells which is another important case of cellular reproduction. <\/p>\n\n<p>Yet the relationship of the knockout mice to calorie restriction has been debated - its been difficult to interpret the activity and the weight loss or gain of the knockout mice compared to wild type mice since the SIRT1 knockouts are smaller.  They may also have genetic traits that compensate for the absence SIRT1 in order to have survived.  <\/p>\n\n<p>More recently mice where SIRT1 expression in the brain have been produced, but the result has been anxiety or anxiousness as opposed to specific calorie restriction diet.<\/p>\n\n<p>This reminds me of the story of <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/164160\" rel=\"nofollow\">leptin<\/a>, in the early 90s they found that leptin deficient mice became quite fat, but despite this obvious linkage to obesity, leptin turned out to mediate a lot of other psychological factors as well - it only caused obesity when its function was blocked.  It did not turn out to be an appetite signal. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/604480\" rel=\"nofollow\">SIRT2<\/a> seems to have similar roles in calorie restriction.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rogina et al (2002) found that under 2 life-extending conditions, Rpd3 (601241) mutants fed normal food and wildtype flies fed low calorie food, Sir2 expression was increased 2-fold.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But also has similar relationships to Alzheimers.

Using the evidence and reasoning I give below, at the very least, the following 9 independent colonisations occurred: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>bacteria<\/li>\n<li>cyanobacteria<\/li>\n<li>archaea<\/li>\n<li>protists<\/li>\n<li>fungi<\/li>\n<li>algae<\/li>\n<li>plants<\/li>\n<li>nematodes <\/li>\n<li>arthropods<\/li>\n<li>vertebrates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bacterial and archaean colonisation<\/strong><br>\nThe first evidence of life on land seems to originate from 2.6 (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6812/full/408574a0.html\">Watanabe et al., 2000<\/a>) to 3.1 (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC533871/\">Battistuzzi et al., 2004<\/a>) billion years ago. Since molecular evidence points to bacteria and archaea diverging between 3.2-3.8 billion years ago (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/94/24/13028.full\">Feng et al.,1997<\/a> - a classic paper), and since both bacteria and archaea are found on land (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204349\">Taketani &amp; Tsai, 2010<\/a>), they must have colonised land independently. I would suggest there would have been many different bacterial colonisations, too. One at least is certain - cyanobacteria must have colonised independently from some other forms, since they evolved after the first bacterial colonisation (Tomitani et al., 2006), and are now found on land, e.g. in lichens.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Protistan, fungal, algal, plant and animal colonisation<\/strong><br>\nProtists are a polyphyletic group of simple eukaryotes, and since fungal divergence from them (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/\">Wang et al., 1999<\/a> - another classic) predates fungal emergence from the ocean (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034666795000860\">Taylor &amp; Osborn, 1996<\/a>), they must have emerged separately. Then, since plants and fungi diverged whilst fungi were still in the ocean (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/\">Wang et al., 1999<\/a>), plants must have colonised separately. Actually, it has been explicitly discovered in various ways (e.g. molecular clock methods, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/293/5532/1129.short\">Heckman et al., 2001<\/a>) that plants must have left the ocean separately to fungi, but probably relied upon them to be able to do it (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00397.x/full\">Brundrett, 2002<\/a> - see note at bottom about this paper). Next, simple animals... Arthropods colonised the land independently (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333434/\">Pisani et al, 2004<\/a>), and since nematodes diverged before arthropods (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689654/\">Wang et al., 1999<\/a>), they too must have independently found land. Then, lumbering along at the end, came the tetrapods (<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/425183\">Long &amp; Gordon, 2004<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Note about the Brundrett paper: it has OVER 300 REFERENCES!
