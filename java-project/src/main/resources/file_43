An action potential is a binary '1', an-all-or-nothing signal without any information, i.e., there is not a -1 or +1 action potential. Similarly, there are no excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. <\/p>\n\n<p>Notably, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, glutamate, can have inhibitory effects dependent on the receptor activated. While most metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors are indeed all excitatory, the inhibitory glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are not <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8938647\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Cleland, 1996)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Conversely, GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, can have excitatory postsynaptic effects. For example, hyperpolarized neurons may actually depolarize upon GABA<sub>A<\/sub> receptor activation, simply because the resting membrane potential is more negative than the reversal potential of Cl<sup>-<\/sup> (i.e., Cl<sup>-<\/sup> flows <em>out<\/em> of the cell due to the negative membrane potential) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15927683\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Marty &amp; Liano, 2005)<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The existence of both excitatory and inhibitory glutamate receptors shows that it is the <strong>postsynaptic receptor<\/strong> that determines whether an action potential will inhibit or excite the postsynaptic neuron. The excitatory effect of GABA<sub>A<\/sub> activation shows that on top of that, even principal inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA) with principal inhibitory receptors (GABA<sub>A<\/sub>) can excite a neuron dependent on its <strong>physiological state<\/strong>.    <\/p>\n\n<p>Besides chemical synapses there are electrical synapses. In these synapses action potentials are transmitted directly electrically through gap junctions.

There are lots of different kinds of protohuman fossils. <em>Homo erectus/ergaster<\/em> are found all across Europe, Asia, and into Indonesia from about 1.5 million years or so until about 70 thousand years ago, where they stop showing up. Up until 125 thousand years ago anatomically modern humans were only found in Africa. About 70 thousand years ago they start showing up in the Middle East, and then they spread out roughly following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations#/media/File:Spreading_homo_sapiens_la.svg\">these paths<\/a>. The fossil record shows not-humans or almost-humans (<em>Homo erectus<\/em> mostly) for millions of years, then humans show up at a certain point and then there's loads of human fossils. This point gets more recent as you get further from East Africa.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prong the second: genetic diversity. Starting with <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v325/n6099/abs/325031a0.html\">this paper<\/a> (not sure if this is behind a paywall but the details are not important anyway) human mitochondrial DNA was compared using restriction enzyme mapping. This kind of mapping is super crude (roughly analogous to grinding pottery into a fine dust and grouping the dusts by color) and the original study was pretty limited by the computers available at the time. Nonetheless, they showed that the most genetically diverse geographical group was Africa, and furthermore that any two people from outside Africa are likely more closely related to each other than any two people inside Africa. Genetic diversity goes down the further away from East Africa you get, matching what you'd expect if humans hadn't been living there long. There have only been (very roughly) 60 generations since humans colonized New Zealand. All Maori people, therefore, are at most 58th cousins. All indigenous Australians are at most 1998th cousins. All Africans are at most 8000th cousins.<\/p>\n\n<p>More recently we've done proper sequencing on the mitochondrial DNA (actually knowing whats written there) and that's allowed much more precise estimation of this sort of thing, and estimation of the timeframes involved. The genetic evidence backs up the fossil record, by and large. (There are a few interesting examples where interbreeding with Neanderthals and maybe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan\">Denisovans<\/a> can be detected, and that the settlement of the middle east by modern humans about 125 thousand years ago failed. They left no descendants.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Fun side consideration (warning, extra science, proceed with caution): all humans inherit their mitochondria from their mother, and all males inherit their Y-chromosomes from their father. This lets us trace matrilineal lines with a relatively high degree of accuracy, since mitochondria reproduce asexually. To clarify: your matrilineal line is your mother, and her mother, and so on. Your paternal grandmother is not part of your matrilineal line, nor are your aunts or sisters. These lines are statistically guaranteed to eventually converge on a single woman whose mitochondrial descendants now live in all of us. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\">reasons<\/a> for this are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(population_genetics)\">complicated<\/a>. There are actually lots of these women, since she inherited her mitochondria from her mother, ad infinitum (well, not infinitum. Ad failed-endocytosis-of-an-alpha-proteobacterium-leading-to-mitochondria doesn't roll off the tongue though). Science has tight estimates on the <em>most recent<\/em> mitochondrial ancestor, or \"Mitochondrial Eve\". To be clear: there were loads of other women alive at the time, and we inherit a lot of their non-mitochondrial DNA. Over millennia all those other women had fewer daughters, and their matrilineal lines died out. She lived about 200 thousand years ago, plus minus 20 thousand years. As a mathematical guarantee we'll never find her body or have a really tight estimate on how long ago she lived, but she's genetically guaranteed to exist. The same principle applies to patrilineal inheritance, but the estimates for the most recent ancestor of all Y-chromosomes are a little looser (200-300 thousand years ago). <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7184/what-is-a-mitochondrial-eve-and-y-chromosomal-adam\">See here<\/a> for a more detailed handling of Eve and what's going on there.<\/p>\n\n<p>In sum: old fossils only in Africa, everyone outside Africa is only 2800th cousins with each other or less, but intra-African relatedness is less than half that (more than twice as far away genetically).<\/p>\n","answer_id":36248,"question_id":36241,"up_vote_count":47,"last_edit_date":1437504399}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36241/how-do-we-know-the-human-species-arose-in-africa","last_activity_date":1437504399,"creation_date":1437409113,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do we know the human species arose in Africa?","body":"<p>I have heard (from multiple sources) that the current scientific opinion is that the human species arose in Africa.

Some of the comments are correct that you will need to compensate for the reduction of the initial cell input with additional PCR cycles.

Most fish are cold-blooded and are adapted to cope with the relatively cold temperatures, but the human heart is not well adapted to even relatively warm temperatures.

Nerves are complex systems, and absent regulation systems in the nerves themselves to compensate for the changes in temperature, they can stop firing completely. A simple heart can run with less sophisticated orchestration, and is therefore more resistant to temperature change. A complicated heart involving the coordination of the atria and the ventricles to produce effective pumping action is affected much more strongly by the drop in temperature. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, in general, more complicated implies more vulnerable to temperature changes. There are exceptions, however. Bears can hibernate and drop their core body temperatures without any ill-effects, so it's possible to adapt to.

If the quantity of the water displaced is small enough that the surface area of the object isn't completely submerged, it can float.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now with the whale example, considering the wax is fully enclosed by the head, how would this change in local density effect the buoyancy of the whale as a whole? The weight of the wax still remains the same (in so far as the example used in the book), the only thing that changes is its density inside the whale.<\/p>\n\n<p>So with a constant weight, and only a variable local density enclosed by an object (the head) and limited to these conditions only (as this is all the example in the book uses), how is this possible?<\/p>\n","question_id":36185,"tags":["biophysics"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":60,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfd7d1d3675f17447c2d9f57267837?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16822,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16822/naiad","reputation":118,"display_name":"naiad"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":36181,"edited":false,"creation_date":1437189511,"comment_id":59850,"body":"it looks like a mustard of some sort?  not my forte..."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlp4Q.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5198,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5198/anongoodnurse","reputation":12148,"display_name":"anongoodnurse"},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfd7d1d3675f17447c2d9f57267837?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16822,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16822/naiad","reputation":118,"display_name":"naiad"},"score":1,"post_id":36183,"edited":false,"creation_date":1437235333,"comment_id":59881,"body":"It does taste like licorice!"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1437197676,"creation_date":1437197272,"body":"<p>It looks a lot like Queen Anne's Lace, but yellow and with more slender leaves.

The miRNA idea comes from that these transcripts are actually differentially expressed in the disease phenotype I am analyzing, so I was looking into  introduced miRNA binding sites as a potential reason.

Thanks for your time!"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1436645962,"creation_date":1436645129,"body":"<p>It sounds like you have considered most of the obvious alternatives (and thank you for clarifying the question).  I suppose the first question in an alternatively spliced transcript with a retained intron is whether the open reading frame of the protein is maintained.  If there is a termination codon that now becomes in-frame due to the intron then the protein would ordinarily be truncated.  The mRNA could also get targeted for degradation due to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway (i.e., from introducing an early stop-codon).<\/p>\n\n<p>If the alternatively-spliced transcript lacks any significant ORFs, or if there is an ORF but no suitable translation initiation codon then you have entered the realm of non-coding RNAs, of which there are two loose categories, microRNAs (there are several classes) or long non-coding RNAs.  most miRNAs have recognizable sequence motifs, may be contained in mir-Base, and may be complementary (in part) to a regulatory target elsewhere in the genome. lncRNAs are less well-defined. Perhaps the best criteria are transcripts that are stable enough to be detected, but lack noticeable protein coding features.  I don't even think there is a consensus on the minimum length of a transcript to be considered an lncRNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>What sort of databases have you searched? For example the ancient dbEST contains all kinds of short cDNA reads from all over the planet, dating back to 1992 (or so).  Evolutionary conservation of exons and splice-sites, or reading frames can all be used to support the hypothesis that a transcribed region has a biological function.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a really deep fishing expedition you can use tblastn, etc. to take a potential translated ORF and search all 6 conceptually translated reading frames of all the sequences in a database--it takes longer, and there can be many spurious matches that you have to search through, but if you are studying something that has never been annotated it might be worth considering.<\/p>\n\n<p>RE: folding RNA (secondary structure) every sequence can be folded into some kind of structure (try it and see), but structurally conserved compact loops typically fall into one of a small class of selected families (like GNRY). Stems are easy to find, but if the single-stranded loop is huge, how likely is that structure to fold up in real time?<\/p>\n\n<p>RE: TFBS not clear to me at all what you mean by this. Transcription factors bind dsDNA not ssRNA. There are families of protein domains that bind RNA but not typically with such sequence-specificity.  So unless this alternatively spliced transcript is being transcribed from some type of alternative promoter, I am not sure where you would even be looking for TFBS.  It's true that some large introns can indeed contain regulatory regions for the gene as a whole (cf. immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer is conveniently stored in an intron), but it is not clear to me if that would have an affect when transcribed into RNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>I do like your idea that a retained intron could now contain a binding site for a regulatory miRNA, but if I understand the theory this would lead to the transcript being degraded--so it would be more difficult to detect.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35987,"question_id":35903,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1436645962},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1437154241,"creation_date":1437117919,"body":"<p>Some suggestions.<\/p>\n\n<p>For identifying function do a homology search.

Some genes predispose people to greater risk for certain cancers. These have a much greater chance of being treatable via viral therapy, but there are still barriers:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The length of coding material (DNA or RNA) a retrovirus can hold and propagate is limited. The mutated gene or stretch of DNA may be much larger than the length a retrovirus could potentially replace.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The retroviral material is not guaranteed to \"rewrite\" or \"overwrite\" any bad DNA. Retroviral DNA is inserted fairly randomly into the host genome with little regard for where since it is generally an entire gene meant to be read in its entirety to eventually produce proteins. You'd expect <strong>BOTH<\/strong> gene versions to exist simultaneously. This wouldn't end in a cure, but some middleground between cured and affected. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There are tissues where cancers develop that wouldn't be infected. Any sort of brain tumor would remain completely untouched by retroviral therapy, for example.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Targeting specific cancerous tissues while leaving surrounding or other tissues alone is a big problem, even for non-retroviral therapies. Replacing bad genes in a cancerous cell is good, but replacing good genes in a healthy cell could lead to that cell's death or -- ironically -- possibly turn it into a cancerous cell as well.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The majority of cancers are not specific mutations and do not have known genes that predispose their bearers. The majority are an accumulation of mutations across sections of the genome. As MattDMo said in the comments (paraphrased): For these cancers, viral therapy is nearly impossible.

I'm still going to ask why because I want to learn why it doesn't work and I want to learn more in general, so you can use all the biology terms you like. The idea is essentially to use a virus and manipulate/change it (this would be mechanized if it were to be mass produced and the type of virus is unknown to me because you want one that is fast growing and goes across only specific parts of the body depending on the cancer). This virus would not have any bad parts (parts that make you sick) to it because when the virus \"injects\" it's DNA or manipulates the existing for copying it would instead manipulate the DNA in the cell it is going into to have growth limits and other cancer genes that are set to being back to normal and then copy itself.

An immediate defense against predators requires an immediate response. The sting of Hymenoptera like the wasps and bees has an immediately painful reaction.  In addition, in the eusocial (colony-forming) species, multiple individuals typically contribute to defense of their nest. One sting may not deter a predator or invader but dozens or hundreds of stings would create an immediate deterrent.  See for example this paper by [Breed et al. (2004)] on the defense behavior of honey bees.  Animal bites that are immediately painful, such as an ant bite or dog bite create an immediate response in the organism being bitten. <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/226156061_Thorns_as_induced_defenses_experimental_evidence/file/72e7e51d9c86e60ddb.pdf\">Spines and thorns<\/a> on plants deter organisms from biting the plant. Odors released by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk\">skunks<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25002664\">some insect<\/a> provide an immediate response.<\/p>\n\n<p>The bite of blood-sucking mosquitoes does not provide an immediate deterrent. (Not all mosquitoes suck blood.) This paper by <a href=\"http://olivermbarham.com/omb_images/NCSU/research/IOP_published_9-8-2008.pdf\">Ramasubramanian et al. (2008)<\/a> provides a detailed explanation of how a mosquito penetrates the skin.  The paper is related to microneedle design but they are using the mosquito as a comparison for <em>painless<\/em> needle design. Go to page 3 to get a description of the mosquito anatomy and piercing behavior. Comparison of painless microneedle design to the mosquito's proboscis is instructive.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The proboscis is the set of modified mouth parts the mosquito uses to penetrate the skin and suck the blood.  The study states that microneedles that penetrate human skin less than 1.5mm is usually painless or effectively so. These needles have a very small diameter, only about 40-100 micrometers in diameter, similar to the width of a human hair. The mosquito's proboscis is about 1.5-2.0 mm long. The diameter of the various structures used to cut through the skin and suck the blood are all less than 40 micrometers in diameter. Thus, the size of the mosquito's proboscis is so small that it does not cause immediate pain, or the pain is so little that it is an annoyance at best. In addition, the proboscis is weak enough that the moquito may have to probe the skin several times before a spot suitable for penetration can be found. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, only the females of blood-sucking mosquitoes feed on blood and have the penetrating mouth parts. Males do not. They feed <a href=\"http://www.inrs.illinois.edu/expo/pdf-files/mosquito-facts.pdf\">entirely on nectar and water.<\/a> Males would thus not be capable of such defense.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21211,"question_id":21194,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21194/can-mosquitos-bite-in-self-defense","last_activity_date":1437128898,"creation_date":1410374473,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can mosquitos bite in self-defense?","body":"<p>When chasing away wasps or bees there is a danger of them stinging us in self-defense.\nCan a similar danger arise when chasing away a mosquito which is otherwise not hungry?

Chem., 1995, <strong>270<\/strong>, 18997-19007) monitored the lipid-DNA complex formation and uptake which was found to be predominantly by endocytosis. Dot blot experiment shows that cells (50% population) took up 60% of the DNA. The DNA-protein complex was observed to be deposited in the perinuclear cytoplasm and formed a series of regularly packed tubules. They also verified that the endosomes carrying the complex did not fuse with lysosome.<br/><\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the DNA escapes the endosome (which is a known mechanism of increasing the efficiency of endocytosis based transfections) and might be taken up by the nucleus. When they compared expression of a reporter gene upon direct injection into the nucleus and upon direct injection into the cytoplasm, no expression was observed in the latter (acc. to Capecchi (Cell, 1980) the ratio of expression is around 1000:1. PDF available on Utah Uni Website). This means that the DNA uptake by the nucleus from cytoplasm is very inefficient.<br/> \nLower amount of lipids in protein-DNA complex increases the efficiency.<br/><\/p>\n\n<p>Your question has been partly answered. How does all that DNA cell takes up gets inside the nucleus? It mostly doesn't. It accumulates around the nucleus. But some of the free DNA does get taken up by the nucleus. This, probably, was the starting point for Dean's group.<br/><\/p>\n\n<p>Vaughan &amp; Dean (Mol.Ther., 2006, <strong>13(2)<\/strong> 422-428) have proposed that the plasmids get transported into the nucleus with the help of microtubule associated motor protein Dynein. They observed that disrupting the microtubule network functionality inhibited expression. When the plasmids were injected directly into the nuclei of cells, this did not have an effect. Now, microtubules transport stuff with the help of motor proteins out of which Dynein transports stuff towards the nucleus. It was observed that inhibiting Dynein action reduced the expression. The mechanism of how dynein binds to plasmid is unknown. (I've worked with dynein; it's complicated when it comes to binding mechanisms. The whole negatively charged N-terminal is disordered.)\n<br/>\nIf you read the discussion of the paper, It'd become apparent that the process is chaotic. The more the dispersion of DNA in cytoplasm around the nucleus, the more is it's uptake by the nucleus.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no Nuclear localization signal involved here. Mesika <em>et al<\/em> (Human Gene Ther., 2005) have increased the efficiency of plasmid expression by binding the plasmids to a protein with NLS. This is not the natural process. Vaughan and Dean have speculated that the DNA targeting sequence (<em>e.g.<\/em> SV40, CMV etc.) binds to proteins that have NLS or have adapters to bind dynein(like, Transcription factors) which might help the plasmid uptake by the nucleus. This can also explain the sequence based differential uptake of plasmids. None of these mechanisms have been experimentally verified.<\/p>\n\n<p>[I have also been wondering about this.

At the risk of asking a question which may well be thoroughly answered somewhere else on the internet, I was hoping for a brief explanation of nuclear transfection.<\/p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/9/R50\">Whiteld et all<\/a>, they describe the direct assay of transcription factor binding site efficacy in human cells.  To do this, they transfect a luciferase plasmid, presumably into the nucleus of the cell (because they subsequently observe that the luciferase plasmid is transcribed).<\/p>\n\n<p>Reading through Materials and Methods and getting to the supplementary file, they disclosed their transfection protocol. The relevant reagants appear to be:<\/p>\n\n<p>FuGene 6 <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a nonliposomal formulation designed to transfect plasmid DNA into a wide variety of cell lines with high efficiency and low toxicity. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(From Promega's website.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Lipofectamine LTX<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>efficient reagent for plasmid delivery and protein expression<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(From Invitrogen's website.)<\/p>\n\n<p>PLUS reagent<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PLUSâ¢ Reagent is used in conjunction with transfection reagents, such as Lipofectamineâ¢, to enhance transfection in adherent cell lines. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(From Invitrogen's website.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently, the protocol is to combine the DNA plasmid with transfection reagent, wait a few minutes, and then add in the cells, and incubate at 37ÂºC for 24 hours. That's all that is required to get the plasmid into the nucleus.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have consulted Wikipedia and Strachan and Read's Human Molecular Genetics 4th edition, but been unable to answer my question about this technique.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think I have a pretty clear understanding of how these reagents are able to get through the cell's lipid membrane, but I don't have a similar understanding of <strong>how the DNA then passes to the nucleus<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Human Molecular Genetics 4th edition, I can find only one paragraph about plasmid transfer across a nuclear membrane, page 704: \"Transport of plasmid DNA to the nucleus of non-dividing cells is very inefficient because the plasmid DNA often cannot enter nuclear membrane pores. Various methods can be used to faciliate nuclear entry such as conjugating specific DNA sequences or protein sequences (nuclear localization seuqences) that are known to facilitate nuclear entry, or compacting the DNA to a small enough size to pass through the nuclear pores.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But nothing in the materials and methods section of Whiteld et. all mentions any of these techniques. I'm sure they would have mentioned if their plasmid included a DNA conjugation sequence, so that can't be it. Perhaps these reagents implicitly include some sort of DNA compaction polycation, such as PEG-CK30?<\/p>\n\n<p>Isn't the cytoplasm an extremely hostile place for DNA plasmids? Shouldn't they just flail around in the cytoplasm until they are digested?<\/p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps these vectors sneak into the nucleus during mitosis? (This is a theory that just occurred to me when contemplating the \"non-dividing\" qualification in the Strachan quote.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the question isn't addressed in the paper, I can only assume the answer is elementary and something that a professional cell biologist would be expected to know.

Firstly lets deal with your statement here:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A positive nitrogen balance (where nitrogen balance = N intake â N loss) indicates a greater usage of proteins.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically means what it says on the tin. If your body is utilising more nitrogen then it is giving out:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Positive nitrogen balance is associated with periods of growth, hypothyroidism, tissue repair, and pregnancy. This means that the intake of nitrogen into the body is greater than the loss of nitrogen from the body, so there is an increase in the total body pool of protein.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now we really cant measure notrogen on a weighing scale. So the blood urea level is used as an estimator for nitrogen metabolism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, as mentioned below, no system is 100% efficient, and the purpose of urea is infact to be as a vehicle to excrete toxic ammonia. Sure the body looses a few nitrogens in the form of urea, but as a whole, it gains a lot more from the metabolism.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>An analogy:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, think of it like this: When you make something out of wood (proteins), you get wood shavings (ammonia). Now you cant reconstitute the wood shavings back to a full wood (proteins), nor can you use wood shavings (ammonia) as they are toxic for you. So you group up the wood shavings (urea) and get rid of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The formula is essentially:<\/p>\n\n<p>The number of furniture made = Function of (Weight of wood delivered - weight of saw dust taken out)<\/p>\n\n<p>If you use a lot of wood (proteins), and are a good craftsman (healthy human)  you'll ultimately have a bit more shavings (blood urea nitrogen), but a lot more furniture to move around. Now since you cant see the furniture (proteins in tissues), but you can see the shavings coming out (blood urea nitrogen) there will be a rise in the BUN.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if you are a poor carpenter (disease or something), you mess up and you end up wasting a lot more wood as shavings than getting the furniture right. So for say 10 kilos of wood, you can only make one couch and 9 kilos of saw dust..  you are really not doing it right, and this is where the BUN gets in the negative territory (I know 10-9 is not negative, but remember the body has a baseline need of say 6 couches and you are only giving it 1, the body will get that from somewhere to the detriment if your health)<\/p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the long winded analogy. I hope you understood what I was trying to imply. I am pretty sure someone out there will give a more scientifically accurate answer, so you might want to wait on that also.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further reading from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki:<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amino acids from ingested food that are not used for the synthesis of proteins and other biological substances \u2014 or produced from catabolism of muscle protein \u2014 are oxidized by the body, yielding urea and carbon dioxide, as an alternative source of energy.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase;<\/strong> the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle.

Ammonia is smaller, more volatile and more mobile than urea. If allowed to accumulate, ammonia would raise the pH in cells to toxic levels. Therefore many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net energy cost.

As explained above, dietary protein intake as well as the protein catabolism end up with a certain amount of ammonia which converted to urea in the liver.

For example there are <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/chamomile.aspx\">multiple species of chamomile<\/a>: There is Roman chamomile (<em>Chamaemelum nobile<\/em>), German chamomile (<em>Matricaria recutita<\/em>, or <em>Chamomilla recutita<\/em>) and Dyer's chamomile (<em>Anthemis tinctora<\/em>). The first two species are appraised for their medicinal properties and help to calm upset tummies and to aid sleep, among other things. The latter species, however, does not have these properties and is used for dyeing. This illustrates the fact why 'chamomile' alone is insufficient.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Popularly, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy\">classifications<\/a> of living organisms arise according to need and are often superficial. Anglo-Saxon terms such as 'worm' have been used to refer to any creeping thing including snakes, earthworms and intestinal parasites. The term 'fish' is used in shellfish, crayfish, and starfish. However, there are more anatomical differences between a shellfish and a starfish than there are between a bony fish and man. <\/p>\n\n<p>In science it has been the convention to use the genus-species notation since <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy\">Carl Linnaeus<\/a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy\">introduced it in the 1700's<\/a>. This formal classification serves as a basis for a relatively uniform and internationally understood nomenclature. A uniform classification system simplifies cross-referencing and retrieval of information. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy\">Linnaean taxonomical system<\/a> aids in this purpose and is widely used. The genus-species system can be extended by including subspecies and varieties. Many (plant) species don't even have an (English) trivial name. Taking your lavender example: there are some <a href=\"http://everything-lavender.com/lavender.html\">39 <em>Lavendula<\/em> species known<\/a> and obviously, many of them don't have a trivial name.

The current leading theory of the development of trichromatic vision in humans is based on the foraging of fruit in our primate ancestors.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nThe places of red, green and blue wavelengths in the <strong>spectrum<\/strong> are physically defined and, therefore, not arbitrary; see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21812/is-human-vision-sensitive-to-frequency-or-wavelength\">this question on Biology SE<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before continuing, it is good to mention that <strong>trichromacy<\/strong> (the presence of red, green and blue cones in the retina) is typical for <strong>primates<\/strong>. For example, dichromacy (&lt;500 and >500 nm cones) is the most common configuration in mammals. The split in red and green photopigment in primates developed relatively late in evolution (30-40 mln years ago), inferring trichromacy in primates from a dichromatic ancestor. Note that many avian and aquatic species may be tetrachromats or up (4 or more photopigments) (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300808454\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nathans et al. 1999<\/a>), with the mantis shrimp featuring no less than 10(!) different photopigments (<a href=\"http://web.qbi.uq.edu.au/ecovis/Images/Justin/1989%20A%20retina%20with%20at%20least%20ten%20spectral%20types.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cronin &amp; Marshall, 1989<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>It is believed that the red-green-blue system in primates has evolved due to its benefits for <strong>identifying fruit on a background of foliage, and to assess the ripeness of fruits<\/strong>. The food of monkeys typically consists of fruit, and young leaves. Young leaves are light-green, while ripe fruits are often yellow (e.g., bananas) and orange (e.g. oranges, mangos) (<a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/263/1370/593.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osorio &amp; Vorobyev, 1996<\/a>). Unripe fruits typically contain chlorophyll and resemble the color of foliage (green). Hence, to discern ripe, nutritious fruits (yellow-orange or 570-620 nm) from foliage (green or 495-570 nm - frequencies mentioned were copied from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>), it makes sense to have good resolution in the red-green area. The red opsin has its maximum at 530, and the green at 560 nm. The blue has its peak a lot lower at 425 nm (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300808454\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nathans et al. 1999<\/a>). Hence, the red and green opsins, which evolved late in evolution, are both right in the \"ripe fruit area\" and have absorption spectra very close together. Hence, there is a lot of color sensitivity (high color resolution) in the red-green area, which covers reds, oranges, yellows and greenish colors. This gives primates a very high sensitivity to recognize fruits, and especially ripe fruits in a green background. The resolution in the green-blue range is smaller (blues, purples). <\/p>\n\n<p>As a background: color vision in trichromats works by color opponency, and specifically a yellow-blue and red-green color opponency. This means there exists no yellowish blue hue, or a reddish green (<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.washington.edu%2Fsbuck%2F545ColorClass%2FDeValois.DeValois.1993.pdf&amp;ei=MGGAVJHGNs_k8AXckYKIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsOvlT1CU4N19IDDES5NN1Ip7mvg&amp;sig2=I2xYLmDhgEGJyXefYMNhiQ&amp;bvm=bv.80642063,d.dGc\" rel=\"nofollow\">De Valois &amp; De Valois, 1993<\/a>). The red-green opponency means that we have exquisite sensitivity in the red-green pathway, as red cones suppress green cone output and vice versa. In other words, there is a high color acuity in the red-green area that helps to recognize fruits.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As a side note: The trichromat color vision scenario in primates supports the notion that cats (for example), being predators with dichromatic vision, do not benefit from being able to identify ripe and unripe fruits, as mentioned by @GoodGravy. In contrast, cats need excellent night vision and motion sensitivity, being nocturnal hunters. Indeed, color vision versus night vision, and color vision versus high motion sensitivity are both trade-offs that do not go hand in hand (<a href=\"http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/131377/file/624203.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelber et al, 2002<\/a>).                        <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://web.qbi.uq.edu.au/ecovis/Images/Justin/1989%20A%20retina%20with%20at%20least%20ten%20spectral%20types.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cronin &amp; Marshall, <em>Nature<\/em> (1989); 137-40<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.washington.edu%2Fsbuck%2F545ColorClass%2FDeValois.DeValois.1993.pdf&amp;ei=MGGAVJHGNs_k8AXckYKIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsOvlT1CU4N19IDDES5NN1Ip7mvg&amp;sig2=I2xYLmDhgEGJyXefYMNhiQ&amp;bvm=bv.80642063,d.dGc\" rel=\"nofollow\">De Valois &amp; De Valois, <em>Vis Res<\/em> (1993); <strong>33<\/strong>(8): 1053-65<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/131377/file/624203.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelber <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Biol Rev<\/em> (2003); <strong>78<\/strong>: 81\u2013118<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300808454\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nathans <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Neuron<\/em> (1999); <strong>24<\/strong>(2): 299\u2013312<\/a>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":24544,"question_id":24481,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1436970480}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24481/is-our-color-vision-calibrated-to-sky-vegetation-and-blood","last_activity_date":1436970480,"creation_date":1417567430,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is our color vision calibrated to sky, vegetation, and blood?","body":"<p>Our color vision is based on three types of receptors (cones) which are sensitive to three distinct locations on the spectrum:  420\u2013440 nm, 534\u2013555 nm, and 564\u2013580 nm.

In the case of burning pain the receptor involved is called the transient-receptor potential channel V1 (TRPV1). It is the same receptor involve in the oral burning sensation of spiciness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now two scenarios are possible given your question, namely a constant stimulus over a long period and \"oscillating\" stimuli (i.e. a repetition of stimuli followed by non-stimulated periods).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Constant stimulus<\/h2>\n\n<p>I provided a similar answer to this question: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14238/what-features-cause-mechano-sensory-adaptation/30914#30914\">What features cause mechano sensory adaptation?<\/a>. This is the scenario where you keep the painful stimulus constant over a period of time. Here desensitization, i.e. reduction in pain feeling, is due to a direct receptor desensitization. This happens because the receptor is internalized (also called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor-mediated_endocytosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">receptor-mediated endocytosis<\/a>) into the cell after being activated and it takes some times for the receptor to reach the cell membrane again meaning if the stimulus remains constant, pretty much no receptors will be left on the cell membrane.  After decades long term desensitization will occur and is slightly different in it's mechanism compared to standard desensitization as described hereafter.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\"Oscillating\" stimuli<\/h2>\n\n<p>In the case you are talking about a chronic pain interrupted by periods of non stimulation then long term desensitization will occur. In this scenario, the concentration of receptors will be reduced semi-permanently (i.e. reduced expression of the receptor) in the receptor cells reducing the pain signal. This is what happens with spiciness sensation. People eating regularly very spicy will physiologically be less sensitive to spices as they have less receptors sensing the spices provoking a reduced burning sensation.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Just as a footnote, very long chronic pain will also change the brain wiring of the pain signal but as I don't know enough about neurobiology I will leave that appart.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35520,"question_id":35514,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1435282930},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":1,"post_id":36095,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1436967311,"comment_id":59639,"body":"Perhaps desensitization occurs, but at the perceptual level it may not be noticeable I guess."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1436967247,"creation_date":1436963176,"body":"<p><strong>Short answer<\/strong><br>\nChronic pain may be very persistent and even worsen over time, but it will depend on the underlying pathology.

Both are used together to overcome the negative effects of single substance drugs as acne or sickness. <\/p>\n\n<p>The risk for blood clots has been known for quite a while (see reference 1 and 2) and is generally caused by raised levels of clotting factors (especially VII and X), increased plasma fibrinogen, increased platelet aggregation in the blood and reduced activity of antithrombin III (which inhibits coagulation). This can happen as well in pregnancy when the factors are naturally elevated (that's the way these contraceptives simulate pregnancy to the body). The paper shows this nicely for two of the factors of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">blood coagulation cascade<\/a> (factor VII and X):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yxbZG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This risk is relatively rare, it affects only about 1-5 in 10.000 women, but is still not negligible. The risk is much higher in persons with defects in the blood coagulation cascade. Compared to this, pregnant women have a risk for blood clots of 5-20 per 10.000 women (for details see <a href=\"http://www.straighthealthcare.com/oral-contraceptives.html#blood-clots\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Blood coagulation is really fine tuned to ensure proper function when necessary but no blood clotting when not. Basically activating and deactivating hold a balance, as depicted in figure 1 from reference 3:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9VRZ1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Smoking now disturbs this balance by inhibiting fibrinolysis and promoting the accumulation of fibrin and pushes it more to the site of coagulation. What causes the problem here is the elevation of clotting factors in combination with the disturbance of the balance between activation and inhibition of clotting. See reference 3 for the details.<\/p>\n\n<p>This effect seems to be limited to high concentration single estrogen and estrogen/progestin combination preparations, while there seems to be no such effect in progestin single preparations (although data is limited here). There is also a significant difference in the type of estrogen used. See references 4 and 5 for more details.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mechanism of how this works is relatively straightforward. The estrogen binds to the estrogen receptor on the cell surface and forms a receptor-ligand complex. This leads to signalling inside the cells which finally results in changed gene expression. Additionally the complex can be internalized by the cell. Inside the cell this complex can bind to the so-called \"hormone response element\" and also regulate the expression of genes. This is explained in detail for Factor XII in reference 6 (and works like this for other parts as well). See the image for illustration (from reference 7):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dVKDk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1436047/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Relation between oral contraceptive hormones and blood clotting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2135\" rel=\"nofollow\">Use of combined oral contraceptives and risk of venous\nthromboembolism: nested case-control studies using the QResearch and\nCPRD databases<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10368523\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hemostatic effects of smoking and oral contraceptive use<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2960241\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coagulation effects of oral contraception.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1741892\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lower Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Postmenopausal Women Taking\nOral Estradiol Compared With Oral Conjugated Equine Estrogens<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/endo.136.11.7588244\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molecular basis of estrogen regulation of Hageman factor XII gene\nexpression.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23348042\" rel=\"nofollow\">Estrogen synthesis and signaling pathways during aging: from\nperiphery to brain<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":35499,"question_id":35498,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1436902166}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35498/how-do-female-hormones-cause-blood-to-clot","last_activity_date":1436902166,"creation_date":1435214869,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do female hormones cause blood to clot?","body":"<p>On most female-hormone supplements you get a warning that is something like this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The use of a combination hormonal contraceptives (CHC), like NuvaRing, is associated with increased risks of several serious side effects, including blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.
