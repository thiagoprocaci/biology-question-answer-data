Tymoczko: <\/p>\n\n<p>Fructose can take one of two pathways to enter the glycolytic pathway.Much of the ingested fructose is metabolized by the liver, using the fructose 1-phosphate pathway. The first step is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase. Fructose-1-phosphate is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, an intermediate in glycolysis. This aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a specific fructose 1-phosphate aldolase. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate continues into stage 2 of glycolysis, whereas glyceraldehyde is then phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate, by triose kinase. In other tissues, fructose can be phosphorylated to the glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate by hexokinase.\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VdrkE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VdrkE.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":38742,"question_id":38739,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8338f9b96b1c61599df745d61145b0c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15878,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15878/243","reputation":959,"display_name":"243"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1442245526,"creation_date":1442245526,"body":"<p>This is my speculation.

So does ordinary table sugar (sucrose, which contains equal parts glucose and fructose), and most other sweets you can find --- candy, soft drinks and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dietary fructose is rapidly metabolized, mostly into glucose, glycogen and fat. This happens mostly in the liver, but also in the intestines and kidneys; these are the only tissues known to express the enzymes involved (see the answer given by sunboyharry), as well as the transporter protein that brings fructose into the cells. Neither the transporter nor these enzymes are controlled by insulin, as far as we can tell, they are always active and ready to convert any fructose that comes around. This differs markedly from glucose metabolism, where both the transporter and key metabolic enzymes are activated by insulin.

Nearly half the year\u2019s visual meteor activity is crammed into the two-month interval just described.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What does all this have to do with biology and your question? I'm guessing here that the Perseids, though rich for humans, are probably nothing exciting for animals. The diurnals and crepusculars don't see them at all (they're soundless and certainly not bright enough to wake anyone up). The nocturnals see the (or not, depending on where they're looking) all the time. So a study wouldn't likely detect much, would be challenging to design well, would cost some big bucks, and wouldn't really help humans like studying animal behavior before earthquakes and such.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a child, I once saw some <em>very<\/em> funny chicken behavior on my grandmother's farm during a total eclipse of the sun.

It links to one 1996 study that talks about the effect of alcohol on rehydration, but not the specifics of yes, probably ok to drink at about this percent ABV, and no don't drink at above this percent. It also doesn't discuss rate of intake, changes based on body weight, etc. which are all things I would surmise have an impact on this. I understand there isn't going to be a hard and fast STOP percent level, but I would like to understand more about the underlying mechanisms and factors that change things. <\/p>\n","question_id":38709,"tags":["human-biology","physiology","human-anatomy","endocrinology","human-physiology"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":2,"closed_reason":"duplicate","is_answered":true,"view_count":398,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1442115283},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42e1234315067529256f34b258d91466?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":18809,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18809/cambelot","reputation":139,"display_name":"cambelot"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f524f51edb2e0e559de5f027217b2d47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14815,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14815/ro-siv","reputation":535,"display_name":"Ro Siv","accept_rate":97},"score":0,"post_id":38702,"edited":false,"creation_date":1442092745,"comment_id":64479,"body":"I am a novice at biology, but googling &quot;amylase ph&quot; resulted in a recommended pH of 7.0 for &quot;Human pancreatic alpha-amylase&quot; .

Both are somehow similar to \"ordinary\" type of cell division - mitosis, but there is no DNA replication between them. As mitosis, each of two meiosis divisions might be divided into 5 stages: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Profaze (condensation of chromosomes, formation of microtubular spindle apparatus between two centrosomes)<\/li>\n<li>Prometaphase (the nuclear membrane desintegrate and chromosomes and microtubules attach to kinetochores of chromosomes)<\/li>\n<li>Metaphase (The chromosomes align at the metaphase plate)<\/li>\n<li>Anaphase (segregation of chromosomes)<\/li>\n<li>Telophase (restoration of nuclear membrane, cytokinesis)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The first division is crucial for reducing number of chromosomes. The prophase is subdivided to following stages:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Leptotene (condensation of chromosomes)<\/li>\n<li>Zygotene (homologous chromosomes form tetrads )<\/li>\n<li>Pachytene (crossing over)<\/li>\n<li>Diplotene (chromosomes separate a little, sister chromosomes remain bounded in chiasmata)<\/li>\n<li>Diakinesis (futher condensation of chromosomes, the nuclear membrane desintegrates)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In animals the function of meiosis is producing gametes. In case of oogenesis (in human) this process starts during prenatal development. Between 12-th and 25-th week of female fetus development cells called oogonia become primary oocytes and enter meiosis, but become arrested in stage of dictyotene, which is prolonged diplotene of prophase of first division. Then they wait 12 up to 50 years (too long waiting increase risk of chromosomal disjunction disorders such as Down syndrome in children of old mothers), covered by a layer of cells - primordial follicle. At the beginning of each menstruation cycle one or a few of the follicles become growing (the follicle cells divide, but oocyte is still waiting). At the stage of Graafian follicle the follicle is about 75 times bigger and there is a cavity full of liquid between oocyte and surrounding cells. The hormone signal - LH from pituitary gland - brakes the meiosis block, the primary oocyte divide into secondary oocyte and small first polar body (which quickly degenerates). At this time the follicle breaks - its ovulation. The oocyte starts second division, but stops at the metaphase. This second arrest ends when sperm cell penetrates into oocyte. The second, small polar cell is released and haploid nuclei of ovum and spermatozoon fuse together.<\/p>\n\n<p>more: \n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":901,"question_id":875,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1432117085},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dca6aa0467d027338e76f88b1b2c4644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":5981,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5981/lee-i","reputation":86,"display_name":"Lee I."},"score":7,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1394387478,"creation_date":1394387478,"body":"<p>When females are in their mother's womb all their Oogenium (plural Oogenia) are being made, they they undergo mitotic divisions to become a primary oocyte.

However, in most cases people refer to what is called metabolic alcohol tolerance. Based on your response to the comment made by Alexander Galkin, I assume that you also refer to metabolic alcohol tolerance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Metabolic alcohol tolerance is the result of drinking significant amounts of alcohol over a period of time as you describe. Both the amount of alcohol and the duration that it takes to develop an increased metabolic tolerance towards alcohol differ from person to person.<\/p>\n\n<p>When most people drink alcohol, the liver will responds by activating alcohol degrading enzymes that break down the alcohol molecules, which results in the elimination of the intoxicating effect. The activation of those enzymes occurs much faster with people who have developed metabolic alcohol tolerance and the concentration of those enzymes is generally higher. This means that those people can break down alcohol faster than you and me, that is, they can \"tolerate\" more alcohol in the sense that they simply get rid of it much quicker.<\/p>\n\n<p>On a final note, being more alcohol tolerant is not exactly correct as metabolic tolerance doesn't necessarily mean that the organs affected/intoxicated (such as the brain) by alcohol aren't necessarily more tolerant. The alcohol is simply broken down much faster and can therefore have a limited impact.<\/p>\n","answer_id":633,"question_id":447,"up_vote_count":13},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1059206e9cdfa0201e2f13d43181c730?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":66,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/66/alexander-galkin","reputation":5247,"display_name":"Alexander Galkin"},"score":8,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1326410898,"creation_date":1326410898,"body":"<p>So, judging by your answer to my comment you are most likely talking about so-called <strong>consumption-induced alcohol tolerance<\/strong>, that one might develop by regular drinking of alcoholic beverages.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can group the reasons for increased tolerance to the following groups: better adaptation for the elevated concentrations (functional) or increased break-down (metabolic).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Functional tolerance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This means that your body and its organs, especially your CNS, <strong>adapt to compensate for the increased alcohol concentration<\/strong> and manage to sustain its functioning despite the elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC).

The usage of the term \"equilibrium\" varies between different fields of study and physicists do use steady-state and equilibrium interchangeably. However, this is not the practice among chemists and biochemists. <\/p>\n\n<p>Having said that, I would say that a cell does attain a steady state. I think what your teacher wanted to imply was that a cell constantly responds to the external stimuli (which is randomly changing) and therefore never remains at any given steady state for a long time.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can the cells not exist at static equilibrium?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, they don't. In fact the term \"static equilibrium\" in never used in chemistry because it never really happens. At a static equilibrium all the rates have to be zero, whereas in a dynamic equilibrium the rates have to balance each other out. Static equilibrium usually applies only for macroscopic objects (which do not include molecules). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A note on stochasticity<\/strong>: Chemical reactions follow probabilistic kinetics i.e. the reactions occur with some probabilities, instead of fixed rates (these probabilities can be unequal for different reactions).

But, I am confused because can't cells be at dynamic equilibrium (where rates of reactions = rates of products)? So my next question is: can the cells not exist at static equilibrium?
