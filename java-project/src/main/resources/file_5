A section from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22414/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg <em>et al.<\/em><\/a> may also be of interest.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Lactate can (and must) be generated by non-aerobic muscle metabolism (i.e. in muscle lacking mitochondria) during exercise because anaerobic glycolysis, with conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is the only way the muscle can obtain ATP to power its contraction. The source of this is the glycogen stores laid down in the muscle after a meal, and glucose taken up from the blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know anything about low-carb diets, but I assume they include protein, so that some of the amino acids from this can be converted to glucose by the liver (glucogenic amino acids) as well as those that cannot (the ketogenic ones that can give rise to ketone bodies). Even if the blood glucose is at the lower end of its range, in the non-starved state the muscle can take it up from the blood. (The blood glucose will be restored by the so-called Cori Cycle.) Even in starvation, if the muscle is working there will be a concentration difference between blood and muscle glucose that will allow uptake.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that this question is provoked by the feeling that the existence of ketosis means that glucose is not available to cells. This, as I hope I have explained, is a misconception, perhaps arising from confusion with the different situation of ketosis in long-term starvation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are other sources of lactate besides muscle, regardless of diet. One is the erythrocytes which lack mitochondria and therefore can only use anaerobic glycolysis to produce the ATP they need for active cation transport etc.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45220,"question_id":45183,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1460737374}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45183/can-lactate-be-created-in-ketosis","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/fitness/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"physical fitness professionals, athletes, trainers, and those providing health-related needs","favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/fitness/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/fitness/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"fitness","open_beta_date":1299542400,"site_state":"open_beta","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.fitness.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.fitness","name":"Physical Fitness Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=fitness.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1298937600,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://fitness.stackexchange.com","name":"Physical Fitness","twitter_account":"StackFitness"},"on_date":1460510279,"question_id":29458},"last_activity_date":1460737374,"creation_date":1460301225,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can lactate be created in ketosis?","body":"<p>After looking at Cori Cycle (from <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Cori_Cycle.SVG/460px-Cori_Cycle.SVG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rhU5D.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rhU5D.png\" alt=\"Cori cycle\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I have a question about how the lactate can be produced in ketosis.

During REM sleep, your eyes move quickly in different directions. That doesn't happen during non-REM sleep.\nUsually, REM sleep happens 90 minutes after you fall asleep. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes. Each of your later REM stages gets longer, and the final one may last up to an hour. Your heart rate and breathing quickens.You can have intense dreams during REM sleep, since your brain is more active.<sup>(1)<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>During an eight-hour sleep pattern, the average adult only spends approximately 1.5 hours (or 20% of total sleep time) in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is important because it is the restorative part of our sleep cycle. Typically, you begin the sleep cycle with a period of non-REM sleep followed by a very short period of REM sleep. The period of non-REM sleep is made up of stages 1 to 4. Each stage can last from 5 to 15 minutes. A completed cycle of sleep consists of a progression from stages 1 to 4 before REM sleep is attained, then the cycle starts over again.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if your REM sleep is disrupted even one night, your body won\u2019t follow its normal circadian sleep cycle (\u201cinner clock\u201d) progression. Instead, you will slip directly into REM sleep as a result of not getting the right amount of sleep the night before. You will also go through extended periods of REM sleep until you \u201ccatch up\u201d on this stage of sleep. Poor sleep cycles can cause grogginess, a lack of concentration and more.<sup>(2)<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>During day, brain might not get enough time to restore itself as one can hardly sleep for 2-3 hours during day. Though your body might get refreshed after this, your brain might not. Also, as @TheGreenOne says, there are lot more chances of day sleep getting disturbed than night sleep. Another thing is that the brain is habitual to sleep at its normal time (night) (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus\" rel=\"nofollow\">SCN<\/a>), so it won't be very easy to get in/out of the habit to sleep during day.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>References:<\/em><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-101\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-101<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.azumio.com/blog/health/rem-sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.azumio.com/blog/health/rem-sleep<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":45247,"question_id":45237,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45237/does-night-sleep-provide-more-energy-regain-than-sleep-during-the-day","last_activity_date":1460710199,"creation_date":1460681713,"answer_count":2,"title":"Does night sleep provide more energy-regain than sleep during the day?","body":"<p>After reading <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42279/why-do-we-sleep\">this<\/a>, I know that sleeping is an <em>universal function<\/em>, and that basically everything with a <strong>brain<\/strong> has the need to sleep. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I am still confused to what extent it is necessary to <strong>sleep at night<\/strong> to regain energy, or if some rest during the day provides a sufficient energy-regain?<\/p>\n","question_id":45237,"tags":["human-biology","sleep"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":45245,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"unclear what you're asking","is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1460706771},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b3ebbebb5baabb440e5c353b42db29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":23222,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23222/caroline-schomberg","reputation":1,"display_name":"caroline schomberg"},"closed_date":1461313043,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":45233,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460673874,"comment_id":79095,"body":"No, there isn&#39;t.

Assuming you have an appropriate primer, the quantity of target doubles (at most) during each thermal cycle, so the cycle at which the signal exceeds the threshold (the cycle threshold, or Ct value) gives you information about the amount of target initially present.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the amount of accessible target in a sample depends on many factors including sample processing, extraction efficiency, sample storage, or the presence of RNases/DNases.

First, the so-called Walker or P-loop (residues β-Gly-159-β-Val-164) at the beginning of helix B. Second, the beginning region of helix C, namely β-Arg-189. And third, the residue α-Arg-373 from the α-subunit (see Fig. 1, c\u2013e) (Abrahams et al., 1994). Sequential formation of these 15\u201320 hydrogen bonds ensures nearly constant force generation throughout the whole duration of the binding transition. This \u201cbinding zipper\u201d sequence would lead to the smooth closing motion of the pocket and continuous conformational changes throughout the β-subunit (Oster and Wang, 2000a; Elston et al., 1998; Oster and Wang, 2000b).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1303195/#__sec3title\" rel=\"nofollow\">Results<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vzLgQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vzLgQ.jpg\" alt=\"Stereo pictures of the hydrogen binding region and ATP.

These show that, in the closed pocket, the ATP molecule is surrounded by all three hydrogen binding regions. By contrast, in the open pocket a space has formed between the P-loop on one side and the helix C and the pocket's α-subunit region on the other side, with a gap between the ATP molecule and the P-loop so that ATP stays close to the α-subunit and helix C regions. An equilibrated intermediate structure where the pocket is half open is shown in Fig. 4 b. In that state the α-phosphate oxygen of ATP is still close to the P-loop, but the distance is already increasing between the β/γ-phosphate oxygens and the P-loop. The phosphate axis has rotated ∼30° and ATP is bridging the pocket. At the end of our simulations (Fig. 4 d), the ATP molecule is located between the two subunits as expected after its primary movement into the binding pocket. In that weak binding state, a newly docked ATP is expected to have contacted the ATPase, but not yet have induced conformational changes. Our simulations are consistent with this expectation. Further, we see that contacts are formed mainly between ATP and Mg2+, and between Mg2+ and the binding pocket.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1303195/#__sec8title\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discussion<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The importance of β-Lys-162, β-Arg-189, and α-Arg-373, for example, was connected to their formation of hydrogen bonds with ATP.

In addition, α-Arg-373 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the α-phosphate oxygens, acting as a restraining force for ATP during the movement of the P-loop and therefore facilitating the migration of the α-phosphate oxygens along the P-loop.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can find further information <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704230\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> or <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10569931\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45244,"question_id":44956,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1460708220}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44956/function-of-the-alpha-subunit-in-mitochondrial-atp-synthase","last_activity_date":1460708220,"creation_date":1459961617,"answer_count":3,"title":"Function of the alpha subunit in mitochondrial ATP-synthase?","body":"<p>Within the catalytic core of <em>mitochondrial ATP-synthase<\/em> there are two different types of subunits; $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

Depending on their nature, secretory cargo then travel through the Golgi apparatus by a combination of vesicular transport involving COP I vesicles and cisternal maturation. A retrograde COP I vesicle pathway connects Golgi cisternae and the ER to allow recycling of Golgi enzymes and integral membrane proteins of the transport machinery such as the SNAREs. Two models have been proposed to explain the fate of the Golgi in mitosis. The first is the direct fragmentation model, where Golgi cisternae are consumed by continued COP I vesicle budding in the absence of membrane fusion, which is blocked in mitosis. This generates a pool of tubules and vesicles (Golgi haze) containing Golgi enzymes and structural proteins. The second is the ER recycling model, where forward transport into the Golgi by COP II vesicles is blocked, but COP I recycling back to the ER continues until Golgi proteins are redistributed to this compartment. Some Golgi proteins may then exit the ER via the COP II pathway, but these vesicles are unable to fuse with a Golgi compartment during mitosis, and remain in equilibrium with the ER. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A more detailed outline of the process of fragmentation of golgi apparatus can be found <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2175146/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/chinese/documents/cell/xibaoshengwuxuecankaowenxian/cocb/15/15-4/15-462.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ltNhI.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ltNhI.png\" alt=\"golgi fragmentation during mitosis\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As I know \"<em>golgi blobs<\/em>\" are also referred to as \"<em>golgi haze<\/em>\". <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sources:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.clfs.umd.edu/classroom/mocb639/Hamza_Golgi_Apr5_2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.clfs.umd.edu/classroom/mocb639/Hamza_Golgi_Apr5_2005.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2175146/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2175146/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/chinese/documents/cell/xibaoshengwuxuecankaowenxian/cocb/15/15-4/15-462.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/chinese/documents/cell/xibaoshengwuxuecankaowenxian/cocb/15/15-4/15-462.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":45216,"question_id":45175,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1460624163}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45175/what-are-golgi-blobs","last_activity_date":1460659262,"creation_date":1460485464,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are golgi blobs?","body":"<p>From a general google search I have come to know that golgi 'blobs'(also referred to as \"<em>golgi haze<\/em>\") are tubular vesicles formed during the interphase of mitosis. \nI would like to be reassured and also learn more about this topic.

I will be brief and a little messy to try to introduce you to some concepts and that will hopefully push you to learn more by yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Heritability in genetics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In genetics, heritability is a statistic that describe the fraction of the phenotypic variation that which is caused by underlying genetic variation. Please have a look at <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/why-is-a-heritability-coefficient-not-an-index-of-how-genetic-something-is\">this post<\/a> to understand the concept of heritability as used in genetics. Note that there are two such statistics, named heritability in the broad sense $h_B^2$ and heritability in the narrow sense $h_N^2$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basics of non-genetic inheritance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Here, I will refer to \"heritability in the broad\" as the passation of trait value (such as behaviour for example) and environment characteristic to another organism. One must not confound what I call here \"heritability in the broad\" and heritability in the broad sense as defined in genetics ($h_B^2$).<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, a lot of things can be inherited from one organism to another. Any such heritable (in the broad sense) trait is susceptible to show interesting variation in the frequency at which trait values are found in a population. If, in addition to that, this trait is susceptible to spontaneous changes (the equivalent of mutations in genetics), then this trait can show interesting evolutionary patterns. If in addition to that, different trait values have different aptitude to replicate (the equivalent of natural selection in genetics), then such trait can evolve in an \"even more interesting way\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What can be non-genetically inherited?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Two things can be inherited without the use of any sort of genetic information (I also exclude epigenetic information incl. DNA methylation or protein concentration in the yolk).<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Environment (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_inheritance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecological inheritance<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Meme<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>See more on Ecological inheritance and memes below.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ecological inheritance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is probably the first type of inheritance one would think of when not thinking about biology. In humans, it is not uncommon for offspring to inherit \"stuff\" from their parents when they die. Similarly, beavers can inherit a dam that has been built by their parents. This type of inheritance in generally called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_inheritance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecological inheritance<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This type of inheritance might eventually be important to evolutionary processes (see literature on niche construction).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inheritance of a meme<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Definition<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\" rel=\"nofollow\">meme<\/a> has been named by the analogy to a gene. A meme is any idea, behaviour, thought or tradition (piece of culture) that can be inherited. The concept of an internet meme is now quite popular, but a meme is more than just an internet meme. While genetics is the study of genes (and much more actually), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">memetics<\/a> is the study of memes. Memetics is a very interdisciplinary field of study that attract biologists, philosophers, mathematicians, linguists and archeologists among others. The hypotheses built in the field of memetics rarely offer predictions that can be easily tested, and therefore a good part of the work in this field remains very uncertain.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Analogy to genes<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>A meme could be a joke for example. If the joke is funny it will replicate easily and enter in new brains. This meme could be said to have high fitness. The joke may come into spontaneous changes (mutations). Be careful with analogies and they may show nothing but similarity. For example the nature of memetic mutation seem to be quite different than from the nature of genetic mutation.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Example<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In humans, the examples are very easy to find.

I don't think human body is very special in this case, so I think most of the urea excreting mammals use urea for the same purposes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The urea is created from NH<sub>4<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> and HCO<sub>3<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup> in the liver (mostly) and the kidney because of blood pH regulation purposes. It neutralizes the HCO<sub>3<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup> created by the lungs from CO<sub>2<\/sub> and OH<sup> -<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The urea cycle (also known as the Ornithine cycle) is a cycle of\n  biochemical reactions occurring in many animals that produces urea\n  ((NH<sub>2<\/sub>)<sub>2<\/sub>CO) from ammonia (NH<sub>3<\/sub>). This cycle was the first metabolic\n  cycle discovered (Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit, 1932), five years\n  before the discovery of the TCA cycle. In mammals, the urea cycle\n  takes place primarily in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the\n  kidney.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In chemical terms, urea synthesis is an irreversible, energy driven\n  neutralization of the strong base HCO<sub>3<\/sub><sup>\u2013<\/sup> by the weak acid NH<sub>4<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup>, and the\n  average daily excretion of 30 g of urea is equivalent to the disposal\n  of about 1 mol of HCO<sub>3<\/sub><sup>\u2013<\/sup> per day. Thus, a major function of hepatic\n  urea synthesis is to effect this neutralization, without which the\n  body would otherwise be confronted by a major load of alkali.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Urea is excreted by the kidney, and is normally present in plasma and\n  body fluids at a concentration of 3.0\u20136.5 mmol/L.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia - Ornithine cycle<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gastrohep.com/ebooks/rodes.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Textbook of Hepatology<\/a> - <a href=\"http://www.gastrohep.com/ebooks/rodes/Rodes_2_3_7.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ammonia, urea production and pH regulation - Dieter Häussinger<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1984 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0968000484902937\" rel=\"nofollow\">The role of ureagenesis in pH homeostasis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The kidney reabsorbs urea in order to concentrate the urine<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2007 - <a href=\"http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/18/3/670.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Critical Role of Urea in the Urine-Concentrating Mechanism<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":23357,"question_id":16626,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1414758493}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16626/why-havent-land-animals-evolved-beyond-urination","last_activity_date":1460579772,"creation_date":1397746440,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why haven't land animals evolved beyond urination?","body":"<p>It occurred to me (while urinating) that this would seem to be selected against because water is a scarce resource.

These can be specific mutations in the active site of an enzyme if you would like to change its specificity towards a new substrate, for example. The point mutations can be introduced with primers when you amplify your gene of interest. However, if you don't know specifically what changes to make, then yes, a way to generate mutations is by error prone PCR or by Quick change PCR. If you'd like to see if a certain amino acid change abolishes activity/stability/etc, you would do Alanine scanning (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_scanning\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_scanning<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>I haven't heard much about introducing deletions or insertions for directed evolution. First of all, they have to be in-frame, so that the overall coding sequence does not change. People are usually introducing epitope tags on the N- or C-terminus for two reasons: 1) to purify the proteins; 2) to increase its solubility. But in general, the introduction of deletion will lead to unpredictable changes to the 3D structure of the protein of interest.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DNA shuffling is very often used for directed evolution. Here is a figure from a Nature paper <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykjwC.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a> describing DNA shuffling. The way it is usually performed is by using sequence homologs of the protein of interest. The different fragments can be obtained by PCR-amplification and introducing short overlaps with the neighboring fragments. The fragments can be then assembled by various methods, including Gibson assembly and homologous yeast recombination.  The advantage of DNA shuffling over introducing single mutations is that you have to screen fewer mutants and the activity/stability of the protein could be improved several hundred fold more.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykjwC.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykjwC.gif\" alt=\"enter link description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>DNA shuffling figure from <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykjwC.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, a DNA shuffling using a method called SCHEMA <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v9/n7/full/nsb805.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]<\/a> was developed in Chris Voigt lab. Shortly, SHEMA is a computational algorithm used to identify the fragments of proteins, or schemas, that can be recombined without disturbing the integrity of the three dimensional structure. It is based on the 3D structure (of one of the parents) and an alignment of the parental sequences. It calculates the interactions between residues and determines the number of interactions that are disrupted in the creation of a hybrid protein. A window of residues w is defined and the number of internal interactions within this window is counted. The window is slid and the schema profile is created. For example. in the figure below, the number of interactions that are broken in the possible chimeras are 0 on the right chimera and 3 on the left chimera. The right chimera will be used in the screening.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zMNWK.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zMNWK.png\" alt=\"SHEMA method\"><\/a>\nSHEMA method from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v9/n7/full/nsb805.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":45203,"question_id":45188,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/45188/directed-evolution-point-mutation-vs-insertion-deletion-vs-shuffling","last_activity_date":1460573111,"creation_date":1460535230,"answer_count":1,"title":"Directed evolution: Point mutation vs Insertion-Deletion vs Shuffling","body":"<p>When attempting enzyme function improvement via Directed Evolution I can see three different strategies to generating variation for the gene sequence:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Point mutations<\/li>\n<li>Insertion / Deletions<\/li>\n<li>Shuffling<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Is there a systematic difference between how successful each of these approaches are likely to be for a particular gene or in general?

This\nprocess is called \u2018photolysis\u2019 and is purely chemical.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Differences<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The difference is in what happens to the excited electron and the extent of involvement of cellular proteins and lipids:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In Vitamin D synthesis the electron just moves \u2018spontaneously\u2019 to\nanother bond in the new molecule that is formed. That is the end of\nthe matter and enzymes are not involved in this reaction.<\/li>\n<li>In photosynthesis the light is first captured by photoreceptors and\nfunnelled to the site of photolysis. After photolysis, the\nco-operation of many proteins in a complex process within a\nmembrane-bond system ensures that the excited electron is transferred\nto NAD<sup>+<\/sup>, forming NADH, the reducing power for then subsequent\nconversion of carbon dioxide to phosphoglycerate. (An\nelectrochemical membrane potential is also generated, allowing ADP to\nbe converted to ATP, the hydrolysis of which is used for formation of\nthe C-C bonds of the phosphoglycerate.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vitamin D synthesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The photolysis step in Vitamin D synthesis is shown below:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AyO8b.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AyO8b.png\" alt=\"Photolysis step in VitD3 synthesis\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The precursor molecule is formed from cholesterol in a series of enzymic reactions and the Vitamin D3 produced (actually resulting from a spontaneous rearrangement of the initial product molecule) may be metabolized further in enzymic processes (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22339/#A3669\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg <em>et al.<\/em><\/a> for more detail). However the photolysis of the bond indicated in red is purely chemical. <\/p>\n\n<p>One may ask why no other electrons are raised to a higher energy level and the  corresponding bonds broken. Other electrons may conceivably be excited, but in the absence of a suitable reaction pathway to a compound of lower thermodynamic free energy the electron will fall back to its original energy level, liberating heat. In the case of 7-dehydrocholesterol the co-ordinated double-bond system provides a suitable reaction pathway to a product of lower free energy. One can think of light (of appropriate wavelength) providing the activation energy of the reaction (overcoming the energy barrier resulting from the higher free energy of the reaction intermediate).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Photosynthesis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The reactions of photosynthesis that utilize light energy (the so-called \u2018light reactions\u2019) involve two complex photosystems that are described in standard texts, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg <em>et al.<\/em><\/a>.

However in this case the product is incidental to enabling the electron to reduce NAD<sup>+<\/sup>. (Chemically oxidation is removal of electrons, and reduction their addition.) As mentioned above, this complex series of reactions also results in an electrochemical gradient within the chloroplast. The movement of hydrogen ions through an ATP synthase in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast stroma converts ADP to ATP (in a similar manner to that of oxidative phosphorylation).<\/p>\n\n<p>The result of the photolysis in this case is the provision of molecular reducing power and \u2018energy\u2019 that will be used to convert 1-C carbon dioxide to the 3-C reduced sugar in a separate series of reactions that do not themselves involve light energy (these are referred to as \u2018dark reactions\u2019, although they obviously do not have to take place in the dark).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Coda<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Although one often hears loose reference to light energy being used to \u2018make\u2019 Vitamin D or sugars, this can be quite misleading.

And if that phrase ruffles your feathers, it suggests you should read the rest of this answer.  I usually wouldn't put the Tl/Dr here on this particular topic, but apparently people have been unhappy with my answer being burred in it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Dawkins is a very loud personality who has demonstrated a consistent interest in silencing dissenting opinions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is a theory which seeks to explain the world and predict future events.  It has entered a special class of theories where we have observed so much evidence to suggest that theory accurately models our world that people find that society operates smoother if we pretend that it is 100.00000% true.  In reality it is not.  It could be wrong.  However, we in society have a choice: we can pretend it is 100% true, or we can acknowledge that there is a tiny shred of doubt that must exist due to the nature of the scientific process.  In general, we have found the negative impact of pretending it is \"true\" is much smaller than the negative impact of people hearing that there's some doubt and presuming there is more doubt than there really is.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, what has made evolution so tricky in the political world is that those who understand science well enough to actually understand what is meant by the statistical data captured to support evolution are generally happy \"rounding up\" evolution to 100% true, because they understand how to use the statistics, and there really hasn't been enough of an advantage to keeping track of the sliver of doubt.  Science <em>always<\/em> has a sliver of doubt, so they're always watching out for it anyways (no scientist is going to say \"you can't be alive\" to a new species because it didn't fit the model).  Those who find enough value in that doubt to take the time and energy to call it out by name typically do not have enough of a science and mathematics background to really comprehend what that level of doubt is, or how to manipulate it, so there is a trend of them doing so poorly and coming to very questionable conclusions. Probability is full of such cruel scenarios, such as the prisoner who runs at a wall repeatedly, once every second, and you may be asked to calculate how long it will take for him to have a 50% probability of quantum tunneling through the wall to escape.  Depending on the numbers, that timeframe may be more or less than the heat death of the universe, but the probability is absolutely there, and its never zero! (hint: if you get in prison, try to get out on good behavior... the running at the wall solution isn't the best approach)<\/p>\n\n<p>In the end, it's all linguistics.  An interesting tangent is the use of \"fact\" in philosophy.  In philosophy, \"fact\" doesn't always mean exactly what you may intuitively think it does.  Many philosophers declare that an auditory or visual hallucination is a \"fact\" because it meets the philosophical definition of \"a state of affairs,\" lending itself to strange phrasings such as \"a fact about something which is not real\" and other linguistic oddities.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>EDIT<\/h1>\n\n<p>I pose a statistics question to you.  Your answer to this statistics question states how you approach the definition of some very key words, so the answer as to whether evolution is true or not will depend on them.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I flip a coin multiple times.  There's no reason to presume it's a fair coin, so no reason to presume P(heads) = 50% like in so many coin tossing problems.  I flip the coin a million times.  It lands heads every time.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I am about to flip the coin again.  Is the statement \"The coin will land heads up\" a true statement?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you answer \"no,\" because the coin flipping problem is in the domain of statistics, and statistically prior observations do not define the results of the next flip (though they obviously suggest at it), then your answer should be \"evolution is not necessarily true,\" There's an extraordinary body of evidence supporting the claim statistically, so we can certainly make the claim \"we are quite confident that evolution is true,\" but we cannot take the leap to declare it is \"true\" because we are basing our position in the statistics that form the foundation of modern science.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you answered \"yes,\" then you may state \"evolution is true\" to your hearts' content.  You have made the presumption that a bunch of evidence is the same as truth.  Of course, you make that statement without the backing of mathematics, so you don't actually have any proof to back your statement.  You are, in fact, making as religious of a statement as the claims that evolution is false made by creationists.  You are declaring something to be true, simply because you believe it to be true.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why do I make such a big deal about this?  Because claims such as \"evolution is true\" are making it harder and harder for people who do not believe in science religiously to accept the results of science.  If I can talk to a creationist about evolution, I can get them to understand our POV in about 5 minutes... but it takes 30-50 minutes of battling them to get there.  Why?  Its because they have been told over and over a point of view about what science claims which is not technically accurate and conflicts with their beliefs.  The overstatement of the confidence in evolution from \"very confident\" to \"100% proof positive without a doubt confident\" actually gets in the way.<\/p>\n\n<p>So please, decide which version of the word \"true\" you wish to use, the mathematical one or otherwise, and make your statements accordingly.  Just know that the mathematical rigor behind the study of evolution is only applicable if you're using mathematic's definition for key concepts like truth.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40587,"question_id":40579,"up_vote_count":27,"last_edit_date":1448221087},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SGxqm.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":18860,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18860/harry-vervet","reputation":1769,"display_name":"Harry Vervet"},"score":28,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl6dm.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13496/cdb","reputation":1164,"display_name":"CDB","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"post_id":40624,"edited":false,"creation_date":1447546602,"comment_id":68482,"body":"+1 for your answer, specifically the last sentence.

Through comparison with the human genome, we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707640968\">Feng-Chi Chen, Wen-Hsiung Li, Genomic Divergences between Humans and Other Hominoids and the Effective Population Size of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees, The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 68, Issue 2, February 2001, Pages 444-456, ISSN 0002-9297, http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/318206.<\/a> From this paper we are given evidence of the following<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To study the genomic divergences among hominoids and to estimate the effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, we selected 53 autosomal intergenic nonrepetitive DNA segments from the human genome and sequenced them in a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and an orangutan. The average sequence divergence was only 1.24% ± 0.07% for the human-chimpanzee pair, 1.62% ± 0.08% for the human-gorilla pair, and 1.63% ± 0.08% for the chimpanzee-gorilla pair. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The key to this evidence is this; <strong>\"we selected 53 autosomal intergenic nonrepetitive DNA segments from the human genome and sequenced them in a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and an orangutan.\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The significance of this lies in the fact that intergenic non repetitive DNA has very little, if any, selective pressure on it to maintain its sequence. Assuming that random mutations do not significantly alter gene expression, then there is no reason that there should be such high rates of homology, unless we are closely related to these other species on an evolutionary time scale. That being said, if some of those changes do have modest effects on gene expression, whether they are timing of expression in development, levels of expression, or tissue specific expression, then those can result in the differences we witness in the modern versions of the species alive today.<\/p>\n\n<p>It would not be too surprising to find this level of homology in coding regions of genes across mammals, especially if we looked at the amino acid homology of the proteins encoded by these genes, as mutations in these genes would be under evolutionarily selective pressure. But to see homology this close in DNA in between genes suggests a very close relationship.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n9/full/nrg1940.html\">Philipp Khaitovich, Wolfgang Enard, Michael Lachmann &amp; Svante Pääbo, Evolution of primate gene expression, Nature Reviews Genetics 7, 693-702 (September 2006) | doi:10.1038/nrg1940<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Finally this paper gives an explanation of how gene expression can account for the evolutionary differences seen between Humans and other primates. It is unfortunately behind a pay wall, but here is the abstract of the article to give a sense of what it has to say on the matter.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It has been suggested that evolutionary changes in gene expression account for most phenotypic differences between species, in particular between humans and apes. What general rules can be described governing expression evolution? We find that a neutral model where negative selection and divergence time are the major factors is a useful null hypothesis for both transcriptome and genome evolution. Two tissues that stand out with regard to gene expression are the testes, where positive selection has exerted a substantial influence in both humans and chimpanzees, and the brain, where gene expression has changed less than in other organs but acceleration might have occurred in human ancestors.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Zoonoses and Host / Viral Pathogen Interactions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I should also add that another way we can gauge evolutionary closeness is through host viral pathogen relationship. Viruses have evolved to have a high degree of specificity in their mode of infection, and what works for a virus in humans may be harmless to dogs or birds or mice because the cell surface proteins that viruses exploit to infect the cells of multicellular organisms have a greater degree of difference the further away species are evolutionarily from the last common ancestor. And while there are cases where there will be intraspecies differences that afford immunity, such as the CXCR4 mutation which provides some level of resistance to HIV-1, for the majority of the species, the virus will be able to infect hosts of that species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many zoonoses cannot be transmitted between distantly related species. With that in mind, Chimpanzees can catch most all diseases that humans carry and vice versa. Simian Virus 40 has been implicated in human cancers and research has shown that the Human Immunodeficiency Virus originated in Chimpanzees and is called the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, though the virus proves to be harmless in Chimpanzees. <\/p>\n\n<p>In contrast cats have the Feline Leukemia Virus, which is highly contagious and can be passed between cats and cause leukemia, but cannot infect humans. Dogs and cats can be infected with life threatening Parvovirus, but humans are not at risk of this infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if you are skeptical of the genomic evidence, then trust the viruses, because they will tell you how closely related organisms are by how effective they are at infecting different species.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40636,"question_id":40579,"up_vote_count":22,"last_edit_date":1447575499},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40d9cf17504d06006a0154ef0b332457?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":18958,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18958/cel","reputation":245,"display_name":"cel"},"score":7,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1447655708,"creation_date":1447580330,"body":"<p>I am not very happy with most of the answers here as they seem to be too ideologically motivated and not so much about scientific reasoning. So I decided to give it another try.<\/p>\n\n<p><code>Is Evolution really a fact and not just a theory?<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>If this is too long for you, let me just say this:<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is an existing phenomenon. There is variation, there is selection and inheritance of traits. This has been studied and there is no <strong>scientific<\/strong> doubt that evolution is a process that is happening now and all the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that I intentionally bolded the word <em>scientific<\/em>. The rest of may answer will be mostly about science.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In science <code>just a theory<\/code> is not meant in a pejorative way. Everything that can be disproved, but scientist have not been able to disprove is a <em>theory<\/em>. The important part is that it must be possible to disprove theories by scientific methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a way you can think of the principle of gravity also as <code>just a theory<\/code>. If you happen to find mass that does not get attracted by other mass, you would be able to prove Newton wrong. But the evidence of the existence of gravity is so overwhelming that I would not spend too much energy on that :)<\/p>\n\n<p>So - from a scientific view evolution is a theory with overwhelming scientific evidence. There is so much evidence that among scientist this debate is settled, just like the theory of gravity. The vast majority of the scientific community accepts the theory of evolution as the theory which is most probable to shape life here on earth.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the attentive reader may have spotted a problem in the last sentence: There is an unlimited number of theories that can explain how the life shaped to a way that we can admire it today.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Long ago people realized that the most important part of a scientific theory is that it must be somehow possible to disprove it. Of course we can create a theory that contradicts gravity where a green-yellowish rectangular slime pushes objects together. Scientists will be able to disprove as long as it is falsifiable.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if we now give the slime the sneaky attribute that it escapes human senses, we have a perfectly valid theory that cannot be disproved. So if someone would ask you if it is 100% sure that Newton's theory of gravity is correct, what would you answer? You cannot simply dismiss the theory of the green slime, can you?<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Okay back to science. Science basically tells you: You can and you even have to dismiss any theory that is not falsifiable. Theories that cannot be disproved are not valid in a scientific sense. Back to your question:<\/p>\n\n<p><code>He goes on to say that man and chimpanzees both evolve from apes. Is he 100\u202f% correct?<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p><code>Is he 100% correct?<\/code> - Certainly not, we can make a slimy theory that works as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Okay, so let's put it in a different way: <code>Is he 100% correct in a scientific sense<\/code> - This we cannot answer. There may be many now unknown scientific theories that explain life in its current form equally well. But at the moment we only have evolution.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So why then are scientists so sure? Why does Richard Dawkins tell us all the time that evolution is real?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well scientists are pretty convinced because of two things: Firstly, a lot of scientific evidence has been collected to support the theory of evolution. There are fossils, there is genetic information, there are experiments that validate certain aspects. But what is even more important: Until now nobody could come up with an experiment disproving the key aspects of the theory of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a second important point here: At the moment we don't have any competing scientific theory. The theory of evolution in science is a little like olympia with just one participant. If someone wants you to bet on the winner, what would you do?<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I acknowledge that there are non-scientific theories that can explain all aspects of existence equally well, but I want to strongly emphasize that these are NOT scientific theories. You do not have to accept science as an important explanatory system. But if you do, I hope I could convince you that scientific reasoning of scientists regarding evolution makes sense and although there is no way to quantify this believe in 90%, 99%, 99.9% or 100%, there is overwhelming evidence that make people like Richard Dawkins such firm proponents of the theory of evolution. <\/p>\n","answer_id":40637,"question_id":40579,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1447655708}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40579/how-do-we-know-that-humans-and-chimpanzees-evolved-from-a-common-ape-ancestor","last_activity_date":1460564278,"creation_date":1447440997,"answer_count":7,"title":"How do we know that humans and chimpanzees evolved from a common ape ancestor?","body":"<p>Richard Dawkins in one of his videos says that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW1Lpa23mOw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolution is a fact<\/a> and not just a theory.<\/p>\n\n<p>He goes on to say that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZIJrRvqqbo\" rel=\"nofollow\">man and chimpanzees both evolve from apes<\/a>.\nIs this correct (Is evolution a fact and did humans &amp; chimps evolve from apes)?

There are a few reasons for that, but most important are that the only thing a mosquito injects is its own saliva, while the blood is sucked into the stomach where it is digested. <\/p>\n\n<p>To be able to infect other people HIV would need to be able to leave the gut intact and then also be able to replicate in the mosquitos which it cannot do, due to the missing of the CD4 antigen on the surface of the insect cells. These are needed as a surface receptor for the virus to bind and enter the cells. This is also true for other blood sucking insects like bed bugs or fleas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other pathogens can do this, examples would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever#Transmission\">Yellow fever<\/a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Life_cycle\">Malaria<\/a>. In Yellow fever the virus first infects epithelial cells of the gut, then enters the blood system of the insect to finally end up in the salivary glands, where the virus is injected together with the saliva into the biten person. In Malaria the pathogen is also able to leave the gut region and mature in the salivary glands.<\/p>\n\n<p>HIV can only be transmitted through blood (either through direct transmission, operations etc.), through semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.

A a dirty needle or razor is many, many times larger than the sucking parts of a mosquito, and a razor is an unlikely vector of HIV.<\/p>\n\n<p>Epithelial tissue consists of cells very tightly bound together; it has to be to prevent constant invasion by bacteria, fungi, etc. It takes some considerable force or sharpness to penetrate. If you've ever watched someone give you an injection (a vaccine, for example), the needle is never bloody upon withdrawal. You might get a bead of blood from the wound, but the needle itself will be quite clean. The reverse is also true due to essentially the same reasons: the likelihood of introducing a pathogen by dragging it from the surface into the subcutaneous area is so low that there is no absolute need to swab visibly clean skin before giving a subcutaneous injection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although skin that is visibly soiled or dirty must be washed, swabbing the clean skin of a patient before giving an injection is unnecessary. Studies suggest that there is no increased risk of infection when injections were given in the absence of skin preparation. (WHO Bulletin)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>HIV is the most serious virus (aside from Ebola, about which much is still unknown) which can be transmitted by needlestick. Sharps injuries - needles, suture needles, scalpels, lancets, etc. - are very common in the medical field, estimated to be much higher than 350,000/year due to underreporting and occurrence in non-hospital settings, e.g. nursing homes, etc. Of course, in the majority of sharps injuries, the sharp wasn't likely to have been used on someone with HIV. Still. HIV is not rare.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even with a potential half-million exposures a year to sharps, as of December 31, 2013, only 58 confirmed occupational transmissions of HIV and 150 possible transmissions had been reported in the United States. Of these, the vast majority follow <em>hollow needle sticks<\/em> (88%), where blood drawn from a patient still remains in the bore of the needle which can be reinjected into the unfortunate recipient. If the patient is terminally ill with AIDS, the incidence of transmission by hollow needlestick is increased, meaning the viral load in the blood is important. A solid needle, even a bloody one, presents a very low risk (the risk is, in fact, unknown*.) Getting blood splashed in the eye is a higher risk than a sharp solid (i.e. suture or lancet) needle.<\/p>\n\n<p>The piercing mouthparts (The mandibles and the maxillae) are solid, akin to a solid sharp. Only the twin tubes (the hypopharynx and the labrum) actually reach blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, given the combined factors of limited survival of HIV on exposed surfaces, the small size of the proboscis (compared to a suturing needle or a lancet, both of which have a higher surface area, yet not known for certain ever to have transmitted HIV), the low probability that the mouth parts have HIV-laden droplets of blood on it, the fact that only the tip of the hypopharynx and labrum encounter blood (the fluid most likely to contain virus) and the extremely low probability that there are enough actual HIV viruses to cause an infection anywhere on the proboscis, I hope this answers your question.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>Edited to add: I've focused on HIV here, because it's not known to infect mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are considered by many to be the most dangerous animal in the world. They transmit a significant number of viruses and parasites (like dog heartworm, elephantiasis, dengue fever, equine encephalitis, etc.), but (hypothesized from those diseases that have been studied in mosquitoes) only after being infected by the pathogens themselves. Some die of the infection; some die before the infection spreads through the mosquito's body, some don't harm the mosquito. But transmission is from infected saliva injected into or onto the bite site, not virus particles on the proboscis, as evidenced by the need for adequate incubation time between the bite that takes up the virus to the bite that transmits the virus. If there was sufficient virus on the surface of the proboscis, that incubation time would not be necessary.<\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862003000700007&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e\">Best infection control practices for intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular needle injections<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/part1TEXTONLY.html\">Workbook for Designing, Implementing and Evaluating a Sharps Injury Prevention Program<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655305009193\">Occupational HIV infection among health care workers exposed to blood and body fluids in Brazil<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.modernmedicine.com/modern-medicine/content/needlesticks-what-you-must-know\">Needlesticks: What you must know<\/a><\/sub> <\/p>\n","answer_id":44917,"question_id":44908,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1459925549},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qztAf.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22628,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22628/arboviral","reputation":595,"display_name":"arboviral"},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30ae076937122c48a1c854d4901c790b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8149,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8149/user568458","reputation":390,"display_name":"user568458"},"score":0,"post_id":45192,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460552024,"comment_id":79013,"body":"Great answer, also answers another question I&#39;d wondered about around why horse fly bites are so bloody and painful!

Deep water divers can suffer from narcosis.  This is caused by the fact that nitrogen and oxygen becomes poisoneous at high pressure.  Helium is added to deep water breathing gases in scuba to reduce or avoid this effect.  Probably the poisoneus effect of gases with high partial pressures cause some brain damage.  The effect is cumulative and gradual.  The more you dive and the deeper you dive the more your brain gets damaged.  Although damaged spots in the brain has been found in divers that has dived plenty of deep dives, there is no sigificant impairment of their life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Breath holding is completely different.  There you get some level of oxygen deprevation (hypoxia) and elevated carbon dioxide level.  Carbon dioxide CO2 itself is not poisoneous but it is the CO2 that makes you feel burns in the lungs and a great need to take a fresh breath.  It is the deprevation of oxygen that is dangerous and can ultimately cause suffocation.  The brain needs oxygen and brain cells immediately start dying if they do not get oxygen.  There is some oxygen reserve in the blood and in the air filled in the lungs, so one can survive several minutes when holding the breath.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to measure brain damage.  Brain cells die all the time as a process of aging.  Drugs like alcohol speeds this process up.  I'm sure breath holding and nitrogen narcosis also cause some extra brain cells to die.  The longer and/or deeper you go the more damage.  How much damage is caused and what effect it has is difficult to evaluate.  But from experience there are no significant immediate impairments from breath hold or deep diving.  Your brain just ages faster.  I think ability to learn and understand new things is the first thing to go when your brain is slowly damaged by drug use or breath hold exercises.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is an interesting investigation where they could measure a marker for brain damage from blood samples: <a href=\"http://www.the-aps.org/mm/hp/Audiences/Public-Press/Archive/09/32.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.the-aps.org/mm/hp/Audiences/Public-Press/Archive/09/32.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Tom<\/p>\n","answer_id":44273,"question_id":34261,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34261/does-breath-holding-cause-permanent-brain-damage","last_activity_date":1460530812,"creation_date":1431679337,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does breath-holding cause permanent brain damage?","body":"<p>My question is: Does voluntarily holding your breath <strong>at atmospheric pressure<\/strong> for a few minutes can cause brain damage?

The concept is close to the strategy of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat\" rel=\"nofollow\">tit for tat<\/a>\" used in game theory.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, red-winged blackbird males help defend neighbor's nests. There has been some discussion around the reasons for this behaviour, but it has been observed that males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males also reduced defense for their nests. Since kin selection doesn't seem to be an important factor here, this would support a tit-for-tat strategy (animals help those who previously helped them). <\/p>\n\n<p>Some primates do this frequently too:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out\n  parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity\n  will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping\n  are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will\n  not gain in the long run by \"cheating\" \u2013 that is to say, by receiving\n  favours without returning them.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The example with the crows, mentioned in the comment, can be interpreted under this light too. Those crows seem to give presents <em>expecting something in return<\/em> (albeit delayed!). <\/p>\n\n<p>What's interesting though is that altruism, at first sight, would seem to go against reproductive success. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Group Selection<\/a>, however, is something Darwin was already talking about in Origin of the Species.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, back to squirrels. I didn't find particular research about them in their relationship with humans (will keep looking), but analysing it under reciprocal altruism it could be justified that they give nuts expecting a potential future benefit for them or their group.

This is why when you step out of a dark room into the sunshine, you are momentarily blinded by the (relatively) bright light.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of these adaptation mechanisms are color-specific, such as those that occur in the cone cells themselves.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Explanation<\/h2>\n\n<p><sup><em>TL;DR-ers, just read this section<\/em><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, both of your eyes experience roughly the same levels of light intensity, both in general and for each color of light. But this is not always the case.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have one eye covered for a period of time, such as when you've been laying down, then your two eyes will be adapted to two different sources of light. If you then uncover that eye, then for a short period of time that eye will perceive the world to be brighter than the other eye. If the light level present in the environment has a tint to it as well, then the just-uncovered eye will perceive that tint more strongly than the other eye.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>DIY Science Time<\/h2>\n\n<p>You can verify this yourself, like I have been doing over the past hour, with nothing more than a makeshift eyepatch and nothing better to do.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First, check your initial state by closing one eye and then the other and switching back and forth rapidly while looking at something white.

An example of this is the PDB entry <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/pdb4oo9/pdb\" rel=\"nofollow\">4OO9<\/a>, which is the transmembrane domain of human mGlu5 with a lysozyme insertion to help crystallization.

Strictly speaking transcription begins at the Transcriptional Start Site (TSS). A useful website for exact definitions for terms such as this is the Sequence Ontology - see here for the TSS definition (<a href=\"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000315\" rel=\"nofollow\">link<\/a>) - although admittedly in this case it does not provide more information than that (i.e. the TSS is where transcription begins... which we might have gathered from the name). TSS will have an associated promoter region, which is where the RNA polymerase (and various regulators and transcription factors bind).<\/p>\n\n<p>To expand: a gene may have multiple TSS' which may be promoted under different circumstances (e.g. with different factors present). We therefore have the concept of a TSS region \"The region of a gene from the 5' most TSS to the 3' TSS\" (<a href=\"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001240\" rel=\"nofollow\">link<\/a>).

Introns are removed, <strong>a 7-methyl-guanylate (m7G) cap structure is added at the 5' end of the first exon<\/strong>, and a stretch of 100-250 adenine residues (the poly(A) tail) is added at the 3' end of the last exon, which is itself generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript. Sometimes the sequence of the mRNA is also altered in a process called mRNA editing, and the resulting coding sequence of the mature RNA differs from the corresponding sequence in the genome. The resultant mature mRNA, in eukaryotes, has a tripartite structure consisting of a 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), a coding region made up of triplet codons that each encode an amino acid and a 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Figure 1 shows these and other features of mRNAs.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0KeqI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0KeqI.jpg\" alt=\"Mignone 2002.

A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v13/n4/pdf/nrg3163.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2012 review of metazoan promoters<\/a> begins with the definition: \u201cGene promoters are the loci overlapping transcription start sites (TSSs), at which the total regulatory input of a gene is integrated into the rate of transcriptional initiation. The immediate role of the promoter is to bind and correctly position the transcription initiation complex\u2026\u201d. <\/p>\n\n<p>A simplified diagram of some components of human promoters (adapted from an earlier <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v11/n5/pdf/nsmb763.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">review by Hahn<\/a>) is shown below.

Keratins, particularly $\\alpha$-keratin, have long sequences of amino acids (often more than 300) which forms a helical structure. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Pairs of these helical structures then coil about each other in a left-hand coiled-coil structure. These are then attracted to another coiled coil so two keratin helices will stick together. These four-chain structures then associates with another four-chain structure to form the hair filament. One of the amino acids which make up these chains, is cysteine which has a sulpher group which is able to make connections with other sulpher groups on other coiled coils. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>The more interactions a filament has with another filament, the more tightly coiled the coiled-coil becomes. Hence, curly hair has more interactions than straight hair. The process of `perming' hair introduces more accessibility of the sulpher on the amino acid, cysteine, to make these connections. Finger and toe nails have many many bonds between filaments and are thus, very hard. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FuzvS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FuzvS.jpg\" alt=\"alpha-keratin structure\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/mpark4/bioc-523\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyTC4.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyTC4.png\" alt=\"bonding between keratin molecules\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/84jh6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/84jh6.png\" alt=\"effect of disulfide bridges\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chem-is-you.blogspot.in/2012/11/style-your-hair-with-chemistry.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Macroscopic level<\/strong>: Shape of hairs is also determined by its macroscopic structure. Look at <a href=\"https://helix.northwestern.edu/blog/2014/05/science-curls\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All hair, whether curly or straight, has two major components: the shaft and the follicle. The shafts are the visible, flowing strands that we see on our heads. The follicle is the part of our hair that resides within the skin, or dermis, of our scalp. Each of these structures plays a role in determining our overall hair shape.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Let\u2019s start at the root of the issue (pun 100 percent intended): the follicle. It turns out that the shape of our follicles is a major determinant of our hair texture. If you were to look at the follicle of straight hair, you would find it is perfectly round. The follicle of curly hair adopts an oval shape. The flatter the oval is, the curlier the hair will be.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Another contributing factor to a hair\u2019s curl is the way the follicle tunnels into the scalp. Follicles of straight hair tunnel vertically down from the skin\u2019s surface into the dermis. If the follicle angles into the dermis then the hair will curve as it grows causing it curl. Although, this curving of the follicle can lead to gorgeous curls it causes one major drawback that all curly-haired persons can attest to, dryness. Within the dermis, special glands line the follicle to secrete oil, called sebum, to lubricate the hair. Unfortunately, when follicles curve sebum isn\u2019t able to travel the length of the hair as well leading to dryness of hair that doesn\u2019t get lubricated.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U1aGC.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/U1aGC.png\" alt=\"hair structure\"><\/a><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3HtIy.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3HtIy.gif\" alt=\"follicle shapes and sizes\"><\/a><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/etcIJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/etcIJ.jpg\" alt=\"effect of follicle tunneling into scalp\"><\/a><a href=\"https://helix.northwestern.edu/blog/2014/05/science-curls\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In this way, hair curls are a consequence of large number of disulfide bridges between keratin molecules and how the hair emerges from the scalp.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45163,"question_id":42760,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42760/how-do-disulphide-bonds-in-hair-cause-curling","last_activity_date":1460453908,"creation_date":1454005535,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do disulphide bonds in hair cause curling?","body":"<p>I understand that the asymmetrical distribution of disulphide bonds in hair cause curling, but do not completely understand why this causes an inherent curl on the macroscopic level, for several reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>I assume that the reason for curling is that in an asymmetrical configuration of the hair(IE not cylindrical but more oval in cross section), some residual stresses are formed by the disulphide bonds between the keratin, If this is true, it would lead me to believe that it would cause increased buckling of the protofibrils. But, even with straight hair and more symmetrical disulphide bonds, you already have some curling and buckling of the protofibrils, but the hair doesn't curl on a macroscopic level. <\/p>\n\n<p>As such, it doesnt seem like this buckling due to asymetrical disulphide bonds would necessarily lead to a curled or organized structure on the macroscale, with the macrofibrils. This leads me to believe I am missing something. <\/p>\n\n<p>To be clear, let me explain my current understanding so that potential flaws in my logic can be made clear. \nMy current understanding of the hair structure is based mostly upon the following website:\n<a href=\"http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EPORTRAIT-OF-AN-UNKNOWN-ELEMENT%5ESUPERB-CHEMISTRY&amp;cur=SUPERB-CHEMISTRY\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EPORTRAIT-OF-AN-UNKNOWN-ELEMENT%5ESUPERB-CHEMISTRY&amp;cur=SUPERB-CHEMISTRY<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As I explained there, the relevant part of the hair is the cortex, which is made up of many axially aligned macrofibrils, or macroscopic keratin fibers, which are in some filler essentially of lipids/proteins. Inside these macrofibrils are microfibrils. These are also aligned axially and in some filler of lipids/ proteins. Inside the microfibrils are the protofibrils, even smaller fibers which are twisted around each other like a yarn. These protofibrils are made up of 4 keratin chains which are essentially twisted together and connected by disulphide bonds and hydrogen bonds. While hydrogen bonds are easily broken, the disulphide bonds are not. In curled hair, the macrofibril isn't symmetrical but I am unsure as to how this, or what other effects, actually lead to the curling. <\/p>\n","question_id":42760,"tags":["biochemistry","hair","bio-mechanics","biomedical-engineering"],"score":6,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1454271945},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b00c839c9e28eb73aeb299bf3ef69a76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17118,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17118/shanzhengyang","reputation":166,"display_name":"ShanZhengYang","accept_rate":86},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca9943a9d501cfd6d3f5155bca9d506e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23089,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23089/user3234810","reputation":1,"display_name":"user3234810"},"score":0,"post_id":45071,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460255274,"comment_id":78742,"body":"only have experience with Illumina platforms here&#39;s a link to the basics <a href=\"http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/technotes/technote_understanding_quality_scores.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illumina quality info<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_Q-Scores.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">More detailed Illumina info<\/a> Take a look at the refs in that document to go deeper.

Even then, I don't know about the exact details of the raw data analysis (it is a proprietary software).<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically Illumina records the sequence based on photographic images. Each nucleotide has a distinct fluorescent label. In a cycle, a nucleotide is pumped and unincorporated nucleotides are washed off (this is repeated for all nucleotides).

The template DNA is present in the form of clusters of strands (at a given location), which enables easy visual identification of the fluorescence. <\/p>\n\n<p>Base calling is done using image analysis.

Caffeine has a very similar chemical make-up to adenosine which your body uses to transfer the energy you eat into energy your body can actually use (chemical energy). When your body has enough adenosine, it begins what is called a negative feedback cycle that stops adenosine production and sustains homeostasis. The feedback loops works by delivering a signal to put the body in a regenerative phase upon further adenosine binding. However, caffeine, being the wonderful individual that it is, disrupts that negative feedback loop and continues the conversion of excess (eaten) energy to chemical energy. But where in your body its dispersed is dependant on the individual.<\/p>\n\n<p>The conversion to chemical energy is indirect though. Since adenosine is a principal neuromodulator, it actually tricks your body into behaving as it would at your most natural wakeful state. For example: Glutamate, GABA, norephinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine are all inhibited by adenosine build-up at A1 receptors (a type of adenosine receptor) but caffeine stops adenosine from inhibiting these neurotransmitters. These five neurotransmitters all assist in metabolism (Glutamate is an essential compound in cellular metabolism).<\/p>\n\n<p>Caffeine will never give you energy, it just uses your energy faster, in fact it probably causes energy debt from the work your body does to flush out the toxin.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short: Yes it can enhance cognition, if the extra ATP (energy molecule made from adenosine) is carried to the brain. As it is not a homeostatic process it's difficult predict.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the body is constantly put out of it's homeostasis, it adapts the toxin into its homeostatic balance (kind of like a beat em' or join em'). In this way, an individual's body begins to need the caffeine to function normally. Caffeine dependance is very low however, since it has been around for centuries, we've evolved to know it as a toxin but to not depend on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>References: <\/p>\n\n<p>J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;20 Suppl 1:S3-15. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2010-1379.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_11/a_11_m/a_11_m_cyc/a_11_m_cyc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_11/a_11_m/a_11_m_cyc/a_11_m_cyc.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/51/1/83.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/51/1/83.short<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":44525,"question_id":44523,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1460430289},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1458710845,"creation_date":1458710845,"body":"<p>In a study by <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1228806\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wight et al. (2013)<\/a><sup> [1]<\/sup> it was shown that bees feeding on nectar containing caffeine seem to enhance the bees' memory of those flowers. They hypothesized this based on the fact that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two caffeine-producing plant genera, Citrus and Coffea, have large\n  floral displays with strong scents and produce more fruits and seeds\n  when pollinated by bees (8, 9)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They tested this hypothesis by feeding bees sucrose solutions with different concentrations of caffeine and measured their behavioural response.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We hypothesized that caffeine could affect the learning and memory of\n  foraging pollinators. To test this, we trained individual honeybees to\n  associate floral scent with 0.7 M sucrose and 7 different\n  concentrations of caffeine and tested their olfactory memory. Using a\n  method for classical conditioning of feeding responses (proboscis\n  extension reflex, 11), bees were trained for 6 trials with 30 s\n  between each pairing of odour with reward. This inter-trial interval\n  approximated the rate of floral visitation exhibited by honeybees\n  foraging from multiple flowers on a single Citrus tree (see methods).\n  The presence of low doses of caffeine in reward had a weak effect on\n  the rate of learning (Fig. 2A), but it had a profound effect on\n  long-term memory. When rewarded with solutions containing\n  nectar-levels of caffeine, three times as many bees remembered the\n  conditioned scent 24 h later and to responded as if it predicted\n  reward (Fig. 2B, logistic regression, χ72 = 41.9, P &lt; 0.001). Twice as\n  many bees remembered it 72 h later (Fig. 2C). This improvement in\n  memory performance was not due to a general increase in olfactory\n  sensitivity resulting from caffeine consumption (Fig. S2A). In fact,\n  the effect of caffeine on long-term olfactory memory in bees was\n  greater than that produced by high concentrations of sucrose when the\n  same experimental methods were used (e.g. 2.0 M, Fig. S2B).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, bees would not prefer nectar (or sugar solutions, as  at higher concentrations (>1mM) as they would find it distasteful.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if this hypothesis is extensible to higher organisms.

It\u2019s mainly due to the formation of ice\n  crystals, so if you put your banana in the fridge, the ice crystals\n  grow, and they actually rupture the cells of the banana skin. This\n  releases an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase and as the name suggests\n  it acts to oxygenate phenols, which have a ring-like structure, into\n  quinones, and these quinones can then all join together or polymerise\n  and produce a black, brown, or red pigment called polyphenol and this\n  is what gives it the brown colour. So, if you have your banana in the\n  fridge, this will occur and you'll get a brown banana.  But another\n  interesting thing about bananas is that if you have them in the fruit\n  bowl, they'll release ethene and this will make the other fruits in\n  the bowl ripen faster because it\u2019s a ripening hormone.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Chris:<\/em><\/strong>   So, the question is though, if this is a chemical reaction\n  making this brown pigment, if you slow down the reaction by lowering\n  the temperature, then it should happen more slowly, therefore, going\n  in the fridge should make the bananas go black slower?<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Emily:<\/em><\/strong>   I can see why you're thinking that but actually, it\u2019s more\n  the rupturing of the cells.  So if you have a banana on your table,\n  the cells are going to be intact, the enzymes contained, and the\n  reaction is not happening at all whereas if you put in the fridge, the\n  enzyme is released and the reaction can happen \u2013 although yes, it\n  might happen slower.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>At the risk of channeling people into a yes or no answer, could someone clarify for me if the following statement is true (maybe with a peer reviewed source which I've had no luck finding): bananas go brown quickly in the fridge because cell lysis caused by ice crystal formation at cold temperatures in the fridge, and this releases Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) freely causing more browning.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads me to another seeming paradox: Why doesn't this rapid browning in cool temperatures happen for other fruits and vegetables? <strong>What is special about bananas?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":40801,"tags":["biochemistry","cell-biology","food"],"score":14,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":264,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1460344020},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9505b9216fdae1f6735ed821cfa7e7f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14834,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14834/tonja","reputation":238,"display_name":"Tonja","accept_rate":67},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acb3c0063d438705f86396a8abc1b04a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12877,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12877/cmosychuk","reputation":4410,"display_name":"CMosychuk"},"score":0,"post_id":42982,"edited":false,"creation_date":1454524373,"comment_id":74097,"body":"Maybe some mTOR crosstalk with your estradiol?

There are a couple ways to think about this, but you\u2019re clearly accustomed to differentiating the <em>manic<\/em> and <em>depressive<\/em> phases of bipolar disorder, so I\u2019ll start with that. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is <strong>mania<\/strong> (excerpted from DSM 5*):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting <strong>at least 1 week<\/strong> and present most of the day, nearly every day...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: <\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.<\/li>\n  <li>Decreased need for sleep <\/li>\n  <li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.<\/li>\n  <li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.<\/li>\n  <li>Distractibility <\/li>\n  <li>Increase in goal-directed activity <\/li>\n  <li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences <\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  \n  <p>C. The mood disturbance is <strong>sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment<\/strong> in social or occupational functioning....<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And there is <strong>hypomania<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting <strong>at least 4 consecutive days<\/strong> and present most of the day, nearly every day. \u2026.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>B. [This criteria is the same as for mania.]<br>\n  ....<br>\n  E. The episode is <strong>not severe enough to cause marked impairment<\/strong> in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I have bolded the main differences between the two definitions. You can see that <strong>hypomania<\/strong> is the term for the less severe form of the manic phase of bipolar depression. <\/p>\n\n<p>Neither mania nor hypomania is likely to occur in the absence of depressive symptoms, however. Thus, there are two basic phenotypes of bipolar disorder (summarized from DSM 5*):<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bipolar I disorder<\/strong>: Patient experiences mania; depressive periods may not qualify as Major Depressive Disorder. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bipolar II disorder<\/strong>: Major Depressive episodes are required; manic phase may be hypomanic. (This is classically considered a less severe syndrome, but this notion has been challenged in recent years.)<\/p>\n\n<p>And finally, one more term for you:  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Cyclothymic disorder<\/strong>: patient experiences both hypomanic and depressive periods without ever fulfilling the criteria for an episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Your other question you seem to already know the answer to, but since it's in the title.....  <strong>Nonclinical depression<\/strong> refers to something on the spectrum of normal (i.e. not pathological), such as situational mood disturbance.
