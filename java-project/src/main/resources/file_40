Eventually, when Biology.SE matures, this question should be closed or locked, and the book recommendations herein moved to the tag-wiki for immunology.

This value was obtained in 50 mM MOPS, pH 6.3. I conducted my kinetics assay in a buffer of pH 7 and obtained a Km value in the 21.5. According to this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1065158/\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper<\/a>, Fig. 2C, the normalized specific activity of the enzyme is about 70% at pH 6.3 and about 47% at pH 7. If I divide 34 mM at pH 6.3 by 0.7 (which should get me the optimum Km at the optimum pH of 5.5) and then multiply by 0.48, then I get 23 mM. However, the paper says Km is between 30 - 38 mM, so if I divide 30 and 38 separately by 0.7 and multiply by 0.47, I get 20 and 25.6 mM respectively.

I understand that pH changes the shape(s) of the enzyme and/or substrate. Therefore that must affect how much it wants to bind to the substrate. If the enzyme's desire to bind to a substrate decreases due to increase in pH, for example, that would mean more substrates are needed to surround the enzyme, thus increasing Km.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If pH does change Km, is this how I determine the Km value of a different pH value if the Km value at another pH is already known? I know that specific activity and Michaelis constant are different, but how much product can be converted per minute depends on how much the enzyme likes to bind to a substrate, which is represented by the Michaelis constant.

I don't think this term is widely used as I see cross-reactive or broadly reactive more often. With regards to vaccines against viruses, cross-reactive immune responses are very important to establish an immune response that is effective against varying strains. Using Influenza as an example, an antibody that recognizes the HA protein of the H3N2 strain and also recognizes the HA protein of the H1N1 strain would be cross-reactive. If we had a vaccine capable of this we would not have seasonal flu.<\/p>\n\n<p>Epitopes are specific regions on the antigen that are recognized by T cells or antibodies. They are the specific area on the protein structure that is recognized. Thus, for a response to be cross-reactive that specific structure must be present on both antigens. Epitopes could be located in any region of the protein, viruses will often have a region that is highly antigenic and highly variable to trick the immune response into focusing on the highly variable region rather than the more conserved regions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Antigenic convergence is related to the sequence space available to the virus. Since viruses have limited space  for genes the amount of possible variation is limited as a single point mutation can have a large effect on the virus. Taking this into account some predictions could be made on how the virus might evolve. If the virus is evolving in such a way that there might be conserved epitopes, those epitopes might be important for cross-reactivity.

It is a generally accepted phenomenon that whenever neural systems are being deprived of input, they start seeking new input, or even generate it themselves. For example, blind folks rarely have no visual perceptions at all. In contrast, they often perceive spontaneous visual sensations. For example, many blind folks report perceiving a persistent grayish background hue. In other words, it is never black in the eyes of a blind person. They also often see spontaneous spots of light. The most striking example, however, being <em>Charles Bonnet<\/em> syndrome, where the blind person may perceive complex scenes with faces and objects <a href=\"http://medind.nic.in/daa/t12/i2/daat12i2p423.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Bhatia et al., 2013)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of tinnitus, the perceived sounds are mostly not complex, but repetitive and simple in nature ('ringing', beeps etc.). It is thought that the deafferented auditory cortex actively starts generating sound perceptions. However, many other explanations have been brought forward, such as spontaneous activity in the hair cells in the cochlea and spontaneous activity in the auditory nerve fibers <a href=\"http://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3988/jcn.2009.5.1.11&amp;vmode=FULL\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Luxon, 1993)<\/a>. I will sum up a list of potential causes mentioned in <a href=\"http://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3988/jcn.2009.5.1.11&amp;vmode=FULL\" rel=\"nofollow\">Han et al. (2009)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Peripheral mechanisms<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(1) Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions<\/strong><br>\nSpontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are small acoustic signals generated by the electromotile activity of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea. While normally inaudible, SOAEs may be perceived as tinnitus. Tinnitus due to SOAEs is mild and is more common in subjects with functional hearing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(2) Discordant theory<\/strong><br>\nTinnitus may be induced by the dysfunction of damaged OHCs while inner hair cells (IHCs) are still intact. For example, intense noise and ototoxic agents initially damage OHCs in the basal turn of the cochlea, and subsequently, if continued or repeated, affect IHCs, because IHCs are generally more resistant to such damage. IHCs are the receptor cells for sound transduction. In contrast, OHCs work as mechanical amplifiers, enhancing weak sounds by providing up to 50 dB, which can be evaluated by measuring OAEs. When OHCs die, cells in the dorsal cochlear nuclei (DCNs) show increased spontaneous activity due to the fact that IHC input is relatively normal, but OHCs input is decreased due to damage to the OHCs. This spontaneous activity is perceived as tinnitus. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Spontaneous activity<\/em> in neurons can occur through a host of mechanisms. Basically, a depolarization beyond a certain thresholds sets the neuron off to fire. In case of the disinhbited DCN neurons, the input from the OHCs is taken away. OHC input to the DCN is inhibitory,m as it is believed OHCs activate inhibitory interneurons. The exact mechanism is unknown, but a central inhibitory neurotransmitter is GABA. GABA can activate GABA-A receptors, that open up a Cl<sup>-<\/sup> channel, which in turn leads to Cl<sup>-<\/sup> influx into DCN neurons and hyperpolarization. When this input is taken away, you can imagine that DCN neurons depolarize and when this depolarization reaches threshold, the DCN neuron may increase firing <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/88/2/699.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaltenbach et al. <em>J Neurophys<\/em> 2002;<strong>88<\/strong>:699-714<\/a>. Hence, as you question whether, in the absence of neurotransmitters, cells can fire action potentials, I say: **yes*. In fact, many neurons have spontaneous spiking activity, often with very regular frequency. These oscillating behaviors are often mediated by cation channels that gradually depolarize the cell up until its spiking threshold.     <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(3) Crosstalk theory<\/strong><br>\nNerve compression (e.g., due to a tumor) may cause artificial synapses to be formed between nerve fibers of the cochlear and vestibular nerve  (crosstalk). The breakdown of the myelin insulation of the nerve fibers may further enhance coupling. Hence, spontaneous activity in the auditory nerve may be generated through vestibular activity.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Central mechanisms<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Some patients may <strong>still perceive tinnitus after the auditory nerve is transected<\/strong>. Hence, tinnitus in this subgroup must be caused by mechanisms located more centrally from the auditory nerve. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(4) Auditory plasticity theory<\/strong><br>\nDamage to the cochlea enhances neural activity in the central auditory pathway, specifically in the temporal lobe in the auditory association cortex and inferior colliculus. This theory was touched upon further above in the first paragraph. Basically, when neural tissue is deafferented, it tends to look for new input or even generate activity <em>de novo<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(5) Somatosensory system<\/strong><br>\nThe activity of the DCN is also influenced by stimulation of nonauditory structures and the somatosensory system has been implicated in development of tinnitus. Somatic tinnitus can develop as somtaosensory input may disinhibit the DCN.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>(6) Limbic and autonomic nervous systems<\/strong><br>\nThe aforementioned theories cannot explain why some people suffer from tinnitus while others do not. More than 80% of those perceiving tinnitus for the first time do not associate the sound with any negative meaning and experience spontaneous habituation. However, if the first perception of tinnitus induces high levels of annoyance or anxiety by association with unpleasant stimuli or with periods of stress and anxiety, tinnitus might develop into a problem. <\/p>\n\n<p><sup>\n<strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://medind.nic.in/daa/t12/i2/daat12i2p423.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bhatia et al. <em>Delhi Psych<\/em> J 2012;<strong>15<\/strong>:423-4<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3988/jcn.2009.5.1.11&amp;vmode=FULL\" rel=\"nofollow\">Han et al. <em>J Clin Neurol<\/em> 2009;<strong>5<\/strong>:11-9<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/88/2/699.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaltenbach et al. <em>J Neurophys<\/em> 2002;<strong>88<\/strong>:699-714<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/306/6891/1490.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luxon, <em>BMJ<\/em> 1993; <strong>306<\/strong>:1490-1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>Further reading<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> Action potentials in the absence of neurotransmitters: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30203/how-does-optogenetics-work\">how-does-optogenetics-work<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":30235,"question_id":30229,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1439965610}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30229/what-is-the-mechanism-behind-tinnitus","last_activity_date":1439965610,"creation_date":1425811733,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the mechanism behind tinnitus?","body":"<p>I seem to have come across two contrasting explanations for tinnitus induced by loud noises- i.e. damage to the hair cells in the cochlea.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, I have read that damage to the hair cells results in them releasing excess glutamate, the neurotransmitter that carries the impulse from the hair cells to the neurones in the auditory nerve. This would result in the neurones constantly being excited, which I can understand would lead to constantly perceiving sound.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand I have read that when the hair cells are damaged, the auditory cortex is no longer receiving electrical impulses from the hair cells that detect those frequencies, and so the neurones start to fire (although I am not sure why no input would lead to neurones going off by themselves! Surely there must be some input to cause the initial depolarisation to cause an action potential?) and so you perceive a constant sound.<\/p>\n\n<p>These seem to me to be two contrasting explanations. My only other guess on how these explanations overlap is that the excess glutamate being released causes death of the neurone, and therefore the neurones after that one do not receive and input and they start firing spontaneously (although again I would appreciate if someone could explain how lack of input results in neurones firing by themselves).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance! <\/p>\n","question_id":30229,"tags":["neuroscience","brain","hearing","neurophysiology","neurodegerative-disorders"],"score":8,"accepted_answer_id":30235,"down_vote_count":0,"protected_date":1435734768,"is_answered":true,"view_count":215,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1427026495},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ygbs5.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16897,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16897/voldemort","reputation":195,"display_name":"Voldemort","accept_rate":50},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q7qa9X6M8oE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACB4/NnR8G0JQGZc/photo.jpg?sz=128","user_type":"registered","user_id":16041,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16041/solarlunix","reputation":1965,"display_name":"SolarLunix","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1439964947,"creation_date":1439964947,"body":"<p><strong>Super oober short answer:<\/strong> The father is Cc, the mother is cc, there is a 50% chance the children will be albino (as you predicted).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>An explination on Mendelian genetics:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>First let's look at (what a lot of people consider) the normal Mendel table from <a href=\"https://www.my46.org/intro/autosomal-recessive-inheritance\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/djpNX.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/djpNX.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Since the dad is normal, that means he has at least one Normal Gene.

Chlorine is generally used as an\n  antibacterial agent in municipal water supplies and may be present in\n  concentrations of over 9 mg/1 in some tap water (measured in Houston,\n  Texas as an example, although levels were generally lower). The\n  concentration of chlorine in municipal water supplies can vary greatly\n  from day to day, or even hour to hour, depending on conditions at the\n  water treatment facilities. Concentrations as low as 0.0034 mg/1 have\n  been noted to reduce reproduction in fathead minnows with 72 hour\n  LC100 (lethal concentration for 100% kill) at 0.15 mg/1 (Arthur and\n  Eaton,1971). LC50 (96 hour) for the shiners (Notemigonus chrysoleucas)\n  was as low as 0.19 mg/1 (Esvelt et al., 1971). The concentrations\n  found in municipal water supplies are many times greater than the\n  minimum lethal concentrations for many aquatic life forms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the well being of the frog in the water of the swimming pool depends on the time the frog spends in the water. Eventually, with extended exposure the chlorine concentration will exceed the one compatible will life and the frog will die. This time is multifactorial variable, thus cannot be assessed easily - the weight and the skin surface area and skin permeability will affect the frog survival in a great degree. <\/p>\n","answer_id":36887,"question_id":36870,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1439919518}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36870/is-the-swimming-pool-water-harmful-to-frogs-who-jump-in-if-so-how","last_activity_date":1439919518,"creation_date":1439645585,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is the swimming pool water harmful to frogs who jump in?

See this <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.nutr.20.1.457\" rel=\"nofollow\">review article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If glycogen is not synthesized and stored normally while resting, then muscle may be more likely to catabolize protein during intense exercise. This can happen to some extent in diabetes, see for example <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12453829\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a>. There are also severe genetic disorders that disrupt glycogen synthesis, but those are very rare. I would guess fasting also makes it difficult to replenish muscle glycogen stores (and muscle triglycerides as well), so strenuous exercise combined with fasting might result in muscle protein breakdown, but I don't know of a study on this.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36209,"question_id":36100,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36100/catabolism-and-muscle-energy-intake","last_activity_date":1439909691,"creation_date":1436970881,"answer_count":1,"title":"Catabolism and muscle energy intake","body":"<p>From my own reading, there are three ways used by the body to produce energy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Alactic anaerobic (direct degradation of ATP and creatine phosphate for regeneration of ATP)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lactic anaerobic (breakdown of muscle glycogen with lactic acid production)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Aerobic (breakdown of carbohydrates and fats primarily and secondarily of proteins)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>My questions are:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Knowing that the anaerobic mechanisms (alactic and lactic) are triggered when the effort is intense and / or greater than body oxygenation capacity, it seems logical, at rest, the body uses mainly aerobic way for producing energy.

If <strong>z was 1<\/strong>, that would imply that the neutral variant is always the case, so the <strong>frequency of other variants is 0<\/strong> making <strong>2* 1(1-1) = 0<\/strong> which makes sense to me as that would mean there is <strong>no nucleotide diversity<\/strong>. That sequence is always that sequence and so there is no sequence diversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>As this looks like it is dealing with frequency distributions I think that total genetic diversity is implying the probability of all of the different allelic classes that make up an allele. So if you have class one which has the frequency  of x and a class two with a frequency of y it sounds like the overall diversity would be the probability of the neutral variant of x and the probability of the neutral variant y. <\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, when you are looking at the probability of multiple events, you would multiply the probability of one event times the probability of the other event. As a result, I am inclined to say that the Nucleotide diversity within classes <strong>πA<\/strong> is <strong>2 times the average of the sum of the frequency of x times the frequency of y<\/strong>, or <strong>2∑ x(1-x)(1-y) + y(1-y)<\/strong> or factored <strong>2∑ (x(1-x) + y)(1-y)<\/strong> or in words the Within Class Diversity <strong>(πA)<\/strong> is 2 times the average of the frequency of x as the neutral variant times the frequency of all other variants when x is the neutral variant times the frequency of all other variants when y is the neutral variant plus the frequency of y as the neutral variant times the frequency of all other variants when y is the neutral variant.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that the reason that this might be done is that, for reasons of selective pressure, x might be favored, so those times that the variant is y, some of those variants (possibly all of them) will be x, <strong>so by multiplying the within class diversity of x by the frequency of all of the variants when the class is y implies that there will be less diversity within class<\/strong> than if you just added the frequency probabilities together. <\/p>\n\n<p>One thing I would do is to do a search to see if there was a correction published to this article, as there was a mistake in the formula. That might help to clarify.

I'm not sure that your last question or those posed by Venter et al. have an answer as of yet. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746894/pdf/239_2009_Article_9251.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This more recent paper offers some interesting ideas<\/a> (references removed for brevity):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More than 20 years ago, Ohno (1985) postulated the desertification of the euchromatic region of the higher vertebrates\u2019 genomes owing to continuous gene duplication events followed by degeneration of newly emerged gene copies in their evolutionary history. Only with the first release of the complete sequence of the human genome in 2001 was Ohno\u2019s prediction of the existence of such deserts confirmed. Another mechanism to generate imbalance of gene deserts between chromosomes might be large intra-chromosomal duplications, from which some mammalian-specific gene deserts appear to have evolved. However, the functional or evolutionary significance of gene deserts is not yet fully understood. At first glance, gene deserts seem to be devoid of biologic functions because of their lack of protein-coding DNA. Despite this, some gene deserts have been shown to contain important regulatory and sometimes ultraconserved regions for neighboring genes that function over large distances. In addition, the observation of stable gene deserts with homologous flanking genes (often transcription factors), which are maintained for long evolutionary durations, as well as the existence of numerous conserved nongenic sequences in mammalian genomes suggest that gene deserts are not just genomic junkyards but instead might be of functional significance. However, some gene deserts can be deleted without noticeable phenotypic effects. Thus, it remains unclear whether the uneven accumulation of gene deserts in eutherian chromosomes, which appears to be the strongest causal agent for the observed relative lack of a NG/LC relation in the genomes of placental mammals, is simply a byproduct of their genome evolution and possibly the long-term decrease in population-size, as would be suggested by the enrichment of gene deserts along the evolutionary lineage leading to mammals. Upcoming detailed reconstructions of ancestral vertebrate genomes will help clarify these points.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Alternatively, this particular architectural feature of eutherian genomes might be linked to some of their morphologic, physiologic, neurologic, and cognitive evolutionary innovations, possibly by regulating genes with essential functions in development. It has recently been hypothesized that regulatory elements in gene deserts function in the regulation of core vertebrate genes. Furthermore, approximately 20% of conserved noncoding elements are eutherian-specific. Thus, the uneven distribution of gene deserts could itself be caused by an underlying pattern of uneven distribution of some core genes in placental genomes. This hypothesis should be tested in the future.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":36897,"question_id":36893,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1439786603}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36893/are-genes-uniformly-dispersed-throughout-the-genome","last_activity_date":1439786603,"creation_date":1439777986,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are genes uniformly dispersed throughout the genome?","body":"<p>I think that telomeres and centromeres are regions with a very low gene content (= regions that contain few genes).

Mammals that eat these plants get iodine from them, which then accumulates in the milk, making dairy and its products (e.g. cheese) another <em>natural<\/em> source of iodine. <a href=\"http://www.thyroid.org/iodine-deficiency/#table1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table 1<\/a> from the <a href=\"http://www.thyroid.org/iodine-deficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iodine deficiency<\/a> section at the <a href=\"http://www.thyroid.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Thyroid Association<\/a> web page contains a brief list of iodine-rich food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quoting the web site:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What are the sources of iodine?<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Iodine is present naturally in soil and seawater. The availability of iodine in foods differs in various regions of the world. Individuals in the United States can maintain adequate iodine in their diet by using iodized table salt (unless they have to restrict the amount of salt in their diet), by eating foods high in iodine, particularly dairy products, seafood, meat, some breads, and eggs, and by taking a multivitamin containing iodine (see below). However, the amount of iodine in foods is not listed on food packaging in the U.S., and it can be difficult to identify sources of iodine in foods.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As mentioned, the amount of iodine in some food depends on how much iodine is present in the water or soil. For example, in the <a href=\"http://www.iccidd.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD)<\/a> there is some mention about the natural <a href=\"http://www.iccidd.org/p142000267.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sources of iodine<\/a> and its limitations:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most of the iodine we consume comes from what we eat and drink. Seafood is usually a good source because the ocean contains considerable iodine. Freshwater fish reflect the iodine content of the water where they swim, which may be deficient. Other foods vary tremendously in iodine content, depending on their source and what may have been added. Plants grown in iodine-deficient soil do not have much iodine, nor do meat or other products from animals fed on iodine-deficient plants. Because the breast concentrates iodine, dairy products are usually a good source, but only if the cows get enough iodine.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iodine deficiency<\/a> causes <a href=\"http://www.iccidd.org/p142000268.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">important health problems<\/a>.

It is therefore not a trait with a simple mode of inheritance.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two important (somehow related) concepts to understand to explain the relatively high frequency of polydactyly (and other genetic disease such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup_urine_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">maple syrup urine disease<\/a>) in Amish.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>High <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding\" rel=\"nofollow\">inbreeding<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Important <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck\" rel=\"nofollow\">population bottleneck<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>If you have no absolutely no background in biology, the following might be a little bit complicated. You might want to make sure you know some concepts (such as deleterious, recessive, dominant, homozygous, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, locus, allele and of course inbreeding and population bottleneck) by googling them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inbreeding<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I will, here talk only about one mechanism by which inbreeding causes those diseases.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a positive correlation between how deleterious is a mutation and how recessive it is (the more deleterious, the less dominant, the more recessive). The post \"<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/32961/evolution-of-dominance-of-alleles\">Evolution of dominance of alleles<\/a>\" will probably help you to understand why this is true.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inbreeding increases the frequency of homozygote loci and therefore, increase the probability of a locus which polymorphism explain variance for the disease to be homozygote deleterious. Using Hardy-Weinberg formula with Sewall Wright work, if at a given locus the allele <code>A<\/code> is deleterious and is present at frequency $p$, then the frequency of the homozygotes <code>AA<\/code> is $p^2$ without inbreeding (under Hardy-Weinberg assumptions). Taking inbreeding into account, this frequency becomes $p^2 + Fp(1-p)$ (where $F$ is the coefficient of inbreeding). In words, the higher is the inbreeding coefficient, the higher is the frequency of homozygotes (including homozygotes for the deleterious alleles).<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, inbreeding matters because of dominance. There are other reasons why inbreeding matters though but that would be the subject of another post.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottleneck<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In population biology, a bottleneck is is a sharp reduction in the size of a population. Imagine you have a population of size $N$ and you selection a fraction $\\frac{N}{1000}$ of this population, you are going to lose a lot of alleles due to random sampling. Most of the times you are going to lose deleterious alleles (as they were already present at low frequency in the original population) but sometimes you are going to pick up a deleterious allele. The frequency of this deleterious allele was maybe 0.00001 in the original population and then suddenly its frequency jumps to 0.1. This is a big deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Amish went though an important bottleneck, there was a time when the descendent of the modern-day Amish reproduced with everybody and at some point, they stopped doing so as they decided to create the amish community (I actually know little about the Amish history but I assume something similar happened). This community was formed by about 200 families only (according to <a href=\"http://listverse.com/2012/10/29/10-things-you-probably-dont-know-about-the-amish/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this not-necessarily-trustable source<\/a>, so very little genetic variance) in 1693 in Switzerland (according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>). They probably \"won\" by not having the alleles coding for clubfoot, sickle-cell and cystic fibrosis alleles (just to cite a few example) but they \"lost\" by drastically increasing the frequency of alleles coding for polydactyly (and some other diseases).<\/p>\n","answer_id":36847,"question_id":36846,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1439774238},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":36873,"edited":false,"creation_date":1439654726,"comment_id":61661,"body":"Good answer, simple and without explanations of why inbreeding and founder effect can cause higher prevalence of a disease (but making a complete explanation would ask for writing a book). +1.

In normal cells, P53 arrests the cell cycle if breakage occurs in the DNA strands; but cancer cells often inactivate P53, and consequently they tend to proceed with DNA replication even if DNA is damaged.

Loss of a chromosome arm would indeed be lethal to the organism as a whole --- perhaps it would disrupt brain development, or the immune system. But for single cell to survive and develop, most genes are actually not essential, likely because there are so many redundancies.

However, you must also remember that this greatly depends on what genes have undergone mutation. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of cancer, it's usually either a gene that regulates cell proliferation rates, induces programmed cell death or helps to repair damaged DNA. When one (or all) of these genes is mutated, the cell constantly proliferates and/or does not die when it is \"programmed\" to do so or cannot repair mutations to it's DNA, thus creating a cancerous tumor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, on to the immune system. The reason a persons immune system does not target and kill it's own cells is because of a certain set of genes that is specific to each and every person called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Major Histocompatibility Complex<\/a> (MHC). These genes encode specific cell surface molecules that the immune system cannot produce antibodies to bind to because they are \"locked\", if you will (see, the immune has a sort of built-in list of genes that code for antibodies that bind to different sequences of molecules (that's how you develop immunity and fight pathogens), the genes that code for the specific molecules that your cells have on their surface are just not on that list.) In order for a person's immune system to recognize cancerous cells as a pathogen and destroy them, the cancer cell's MHC genes would also need to be mutated drastically.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, breast cancer is usually caused by a mutation in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>BRCA1<\/em><\/a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>BRCA2<\/em><\/a> genes. These genes assist in DNA repair. Even if this mutation happens, these cells still have the same MHC as the rest of the cells in your body because <em>BRCA1<\/em> and <em>BRCA2<\/em> don't really have much to do with MHC. Because of this, the immune system does not recognize the cancerous cells as a threat and is unable to destroy or even detect them.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>CDB<\/p>\n","answer_id":36878,"question_id":36867,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36867/if-tumors-have-lots-of-mutations-in-them-how-is-it-the-immune-system-cant-detec","last_activity_date":1439664164,"creation_date":1439638234,"answer_count":2,"title":"If Tumors have lots of mutations in them how is it the immune system can't detect them?","body":"<p>If a cancerous tumor has a lot of mutations in them why can't the immune system detect them?

Beyond that, you've rightly identified a number of advantages to burying seeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, it may be helpful to note that <em>no physical substrate is even necessary<\/em> for plant nutrition. We can actually grow plants in mid-air, but for the fact that we would still need something to keep them still. Seeds will germinate if you simply spray nutrients at them - see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroponics\">aeroponics<\/a>. This is because plants take in what would be soil nutrients via cation exchange and diffusion, as opposed to more a more active process like phagocytosis. By surrounding the seed with nutrient rich substrate, we inadvertently improved germination by exposing more of their surface area to nutrients.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as soil seeking behavior goes, Thomas Knight demonstrated that plants can actually find the ground by following gravity. He did this by sticking seeds onto a rotating disc to simulate gravity in another direction and germinating them there. The seeds responded by growing roots <em>away from the center<\/em> and sprouting stalk <em>towards<\/em> the center.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, burying seeds too deep means that they may run out of energy before they can break the surface.
