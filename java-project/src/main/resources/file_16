Another way to alter hydrogen bonds is with heat; electric straighteners work because of this principle. The platters on electric straighteners are flat so that when your hair cools it takes the shape of \"flat\" as the hydrogen bonds reform. The same thing occurs with curling irons, but since the heating element is circular, the hair stays curled as it cools. The effect of heat, however, is temporary, over time the hydrogen bonds eventually return to their original form and the hairs goes back to the way they were. This rearrangement happens because moisture in the air hydrates the proteins. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/hair-straighteners/our-report/how-to-get-straight-hair-whats-the-best-option/\">This source<\/a> provides a similar explanation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Running a flat iron through blown-dry hair breaks the hair\u2019s hydrogen bonds. It flattens hair until water or water vapor (from humidity, drizzle or the shower) penetrates the hair fiber and allows the hydrogen bonds to revert to their natural positions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the straightening of hair with an flat iron does not involve the breakage of disulfide bonds as I had originally hypothesized.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For perming hair<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yalescientific.org/2010/04/everyday-qa-how-does-a-perm-work/\">This article<\/a> suggests that perming involves the chemical treatment of hair with reducing agents to break the present disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids, followed by the reformation of the disulfide bonds in the desired curled shape.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a standard \u201ccold\u201d perm, hair is put into curlers and the reducing agent ammonium thioglycolate is added. The disulfide bonds break and keratin molecules are now free to move around and adjust to the shape of the curl. Then a \u201cneutralizer,\u201d such as hydrogen peroxide, is added to reverse the effect of the reducing agent. New disulfide bonds form so the keratin molecules are locked into the shape of the curls.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perm_%28hairstyle%29\">This Wikipedia article<\/a> also suggests that the <em>chemical<\/em> straightening of hair is obtained with the same process.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2243,"question_id":2180,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cfe1f131d0006d7f67910448b289051?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":21872,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/21872/sandra-murillo","reputation":11,"display_name":"Sandra Murillo"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":43330,"edited":false,"creation_date":1455489459,"comment_id":74950,"body":"Welcome to Bio and thanks for your answer. +1 could you add a reference?"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1455487950,"creation_date":1455487950,"body":"<p>When disulfide bonds break it leads to hydrogen bonds, which then changes the shape of the alpha keratin protein.

This location can be of any size. It can be a single <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide\" rel=\"nofollow\">nucleotide<\/a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table\" rel=\"nofollow\">codon<\/a>, a whole <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">gene<\/a> or even longer.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>An <em>allele<\/em> is one variant at a given locus. When considering relatively short loci (say 1 nucleotide or 1 base pair (bp)), then the majority of loci have only one allele.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>What is evolution?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is defined as any change in allele frequency in a population over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of \"forces\" that affect evolutionary processes. I picked the 3 most commonly considered: Mutations, Natural Selection and genetic drift<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Selection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Natural Selection is the process by which variants of genes called alleles are selected and therefore increase in frequency. This selection result from a differential reproductive success.<\/p>\n\n<p>Natural selection occurs whenever the three following conditions are respected<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Individuals in a population varies in terms of a given trait<\/li>\n<li>This trait has some (additive) heritability. <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is one of the several posts that explain the concept of heritability. It might be slightly a post that is a bit advanced for you though but shortly speaking it means that offspring are more similar to their parents more than they are to other non-kin individuals in the population.<\/li>\n<li>The fitness varies (not necessarily linearly) as the trait varies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Simple example:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In a population, there are blue pens and red pens<\/li>\n<li>Reproduction is asexual and blue pens create other blue pens while red pens create other red pens.<\/li>\n<li>blue pens make more offspring than red pens.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In such situation natural selection occurs yielding the frequency of the blue pens to increase in the population while the frequency of red pens will decrease.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may want to have a look at <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/why-is-a-heritability-coefficient-not-an-index-of-how-genetic-something-is/42280#42280\">this post<\/a> (although it might be too advanced) to understand the concept of heritability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In the broad sense mutation is any change in the DNA sequence. Some changes are more likely to happen that other but in any case the likeliness of these changes to happen is not dependent on the consequence they will have on the phenotype (shortly speaking, phenotype is how an individual looks like) and on the reproductive success. So mutations occur randomly and the specific mutation that would be needed in the population may not occur. Therefore saying, if a trait is needed (in the sense of \"if a trait would be beneficial\"), then a mutation will occur to make this trait existing is wrong. Note that most mutations are deleterious (decrease the reproductive success) while few of them are beneficial (increase the reproductive success) and those that are beneficial are more likely to raise in frequency in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations can be a simple a \"small change\" such as nucleotide substitution, an nucleotide insertion and deletion or can be a \"bigger change\" such as a chromosomal duplication/deletion, a whole genome duplication and the duplication/deletion of a long sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations create the genetic variance on which natural selection selects the best variants. As a consequence natural selection decreases the genetic variance while mutations increases genetic variance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic drift<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If the change in frequency of mutations would depend exclusively on natural selection, then I would not have said before that a beneficial mutation is more likely to raise in frequency but I would have said that a beneficial mutation will raise in frequency deterministically. An intuitive explanation of what is genetic drift can be found on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a>.

It is estimated they occur 1 - 2 times per second and they can reach amplitudes of up to 1 degrees of field of view <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n2/full/nrn3405.html\">(Martinez-Conde <em>et al<\/em>., 2013)<\/a> and last for about 15 ms <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427003/\">(Cui <em>et al<\/em>., 2009)<\/a>. It is thought that these movements prevent adaptation at the retinal level, and prevent image fading. Hence, <strong>images on the retina<\/strong> are constantly mechanically <strong>refreshed<\/strong>. The brain in turn stabilizes the image by correcting the image at the perceptual level through oculomotor feedback <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n2/full/nrn3405.html\">(Martinez-Conde <em>et al<\/em>., 2013)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hHZTr.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hHZTr.jpg\" alt=\"Microsaccades\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

The brain has absolutely no problem processing images in low-light at speed.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer is all to do with the fact that the eye is not a camera. Much of the old-school theories which where based on the fact that the eye works like a camera, such as persistence of vision, etc, have been proven demonstrably wrong. The eye does not have a shutter speed - information is constantly being sent back to the brain with no interval delay.\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that resolving blur/etc is done in the brain, not by the eye. Think of digital image stabilization that actually works, and works in real-time.\nHowever, the brain does appear to work on chunks of eye-input, at roughly 16-24 chunks a second. Why this speed? Well, liking the brain to a computer, it probably has something to do with the amount of memory the brain can store for unprocessed eye-data. Long-exposure photos require a lot of RAM to store the raw data, then a lot of time to compile it into a single image. The brain could do no doubt do the compilation from raw data to image, but it very likely cannot store more than 1/24th of a second's worth of data in \"memory\" before it has to compile.<\/p>\n\n<p>More importantly, doing so would reduce our reaction time significantly. This is important because you do not want an organism that can see a branch clearly at night, but when they try to grab it, miss by 5-10 seconds.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43140,"question_id":43095,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e680e1b996d90be5cedf4aba1c783514?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19803,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19803/zigmund","reputation":31,"display_name":"Zigmund"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1455413611,"creation_date":1455413611,"body":"<p>I wish my computer as capable of sending an illustration of the arrangement of the human eye, versus the hypothetical \"camera lens\" idea, <strong><em>as organic eyes and camera optics are in NO WAY SIMILAR!<\/em><\/strong> Most of you have been in gross error by doing such, in your discussions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The eye uses a combination of organic optical cells called \"rods,\" and \"cones,\" in order to manifest an image. In addition, there is a \"dead spot\" on the image perceived by an eye, owing to the insertion-point of the optical nerve. Any discussion of organic vision has to take these facts into account.<\/p>\n\n<p>Organic eyes MUST go through a variable period of \"dark-adaptation\" in order to be able to perceive an image,as well. <strong>The minimum period is between 50-120 minutes;<\/strong> and even then, even an instant's exposure to \"brighter\" light will erase all of this adaptation, necessitating \"restarting the clock\" to dark-adapt the eye, again. <\/p>\n\n<p>There's an anecdotal tale purporting that pirates had worn eye patches so that they achieved and kept dark-adaptation in one eye. There are many advantages to keeping one eye dark-adapted--- one is going from a brightly-lit deck, down into the very dim below-decks areas of a victim's ship. This is a case where being able to pull off the patch and being able to immediately see the enemy crewman coming in with a cutlass would be very valuable!<\/p>\n\n<p>Another factor is that the distribution of rods and cones is not uniform, across the eye. <strong>Cones deal with colour-perception<\/strong>, and are concentrated at the centre of of the visual field. The concentration of cones rapidly declines, going outward. <\/p>\n\n<p>Densities of rods in the same eye rapidly increases, going out from about five degrees from dead centre to a maximum of approximately 25 degrees from dead centre. <strong>Rods are responsible for our peripheral vision, our \"sensitivity\" to even seemingly-microscopic motion, AND OUR NIGHT VISION.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Because of the lack of rod-cells at the centre of our eyes' visual field, we are unable to see anything dead-ahead of us, under low-light conditions!<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to be able to bring the maximum number of rod-cells to bear on an \"item of interest\" in our visual field, <strong>we have to use our peripheral vision and \"cheat\" off to one side of our visual field by about 25 degrees.<\/strong> This is like watching the front door in the centre of a building by looking \"straight\" at the middle of the left or right facade.<\/p>\n\n<p>One would also be able to detect motion far easier than exact shape by looking in such a way.

Has selection on eyesight been relaxed, or changed significantly, in modern humans? If so, when? Do we know what might explain relaxed selection? If there are any genes associated with, for example, myopia, has their population frequency increased through human history, or has it remained constant?<\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/science/agriculture-linked-to-dna-changes-in-ancient-europe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times article<\/a> discusses genetic changes 8 to 4 thousand years ago related to skin color, amino acid absorption, and eventually milk digestion, but it does not mention eyesight.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background on why I find the question interesting:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine speculated that human eyesight is worse today than it was only a few centuries ago, due to the invention and widespread adoption of glasses: a person with poor eyesight genes will now survive and have children, whereas in 1600 they might have died without reproducing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm skeptical: first, glasses became widespread only a few generations ago; second, blurry vision plausibly has little effect on evolutionary fitness. I see no reason why someone with slight myopia would on average have significantly fewer offspring than someone with 20/20 vision, even in a tribe of hunter-gatherers. A short-sighted person could specialize in making hand-axes, for example, and trade them for food -- so I find it plausible that eyesight-related allele frequencies have not changed much over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I recently heard someone on the radio speculate that eyesight might have worsened significantly a few thousand years ago with the invention of agriculture; the story is that above-average eyesight is a major fitness advantage for a hunter, but not for a farmer.  What does the evidence say?<\/p>\n\n<p>Side note: I realize that eyesight is affected by more than just genes -- for example, age as well as time spent reading books probably both affect eyesight. That's not what this question is about -- I'm interested in genetic selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit:  this question is indeed similar to <a href=\"https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17678/bad-eyesight-and-evolution\">Bad Eyesight and Evolution<\/a>, but it isn't identical.  That question asks why poor eyesight can persist at all, while mine asks whether evolutionary pressures have changed over time.  In particular, do we know of any genes associated with, say, myopia?

In the simple system we have our plants (lettuce) and our herbivores (rabbits). The lettuces have a constant population size, and can support a limited population of rabbits. The rabbits satisfy their energetic and nutritional requirements by eating lettuces. <\/p>\n\n<p>We then introduce a new species (humans) which are capable of eating both lettuce and rabbits (omnivores). If the humans limited themselves to only the lettuces as a food source they would have to compete with the rabbits in order to survive. Alternatively the humans could hunt rabbits, as rabbits are also a potential source of energy and nutrition. The point being that, if a strategy has the potential to satisfy the energetic and nutritional requirements of a species, then that strategy has the potential to evolve. <strong>Because both plants and animals carry energetic and nutritional value, herbivory and carnivory/omnivory can evolve.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioural-Ecology-Evolutionary-Approach-Edition/dp/0865427313\"><em>\"All behaviour takes time. All behaviour consumes energy.\"<\/em><\/a><sup> <strong>[1]<\/strong><\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now consider the nutritional and energetic value of two the two food sources, plants and meat. Meat is typically richer in calories than vegetation, particularly those coming from fat and protein. 100 grams of lettuce <a href=\"https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/generic/lettuce-raw?portionid=54930&amp;portionamount=100.000\">contains around 14 calories<\/a>, while 100 grams of <a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/3820/2\">beef contains about 200 calories<\/a>. Protein is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\">used by the body for growth, to repair tissues, produce hormones and enzymes and much more<\/a>. Fat has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat#Chemistry_of_Fats\">high energy content per gram<\/a> (roughly twice as many calories per gram than protein or carbohydrate), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat#Importance_for_living_organisms\">is essential for the digestion of some vitamins,  and is an effective insulator<\/a>. Given that behaviour takes time and energy, it is perhaps not hard to see that <strong>consuming meat can help to satisfy the energy requirements more quickly than consuming plants<\/strong>, allowing meat eaters more time for other essential activity <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioural-Ecology-Evolutionary-Approach-Edition/dp/0865427313\">like sleep and reproduction<\/a>. Consider the activity of two large mammals, elephants and lions. Elephants <a href=\"http://www.nationalelephantcenter.org/learn/\">spend a lot of time eating, some 12-18 hours per day<\/a> (fortunately for them are quite able to eat on the move). Lions on the other hand typically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion#Behaviour\">hunt for short periods<\/a> of the day (dawn and dusk), allowing them to avoid the heat (reducing water requirements), to rest, and reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider also that vegetation is often hard to digest - it is often is rich in cellulose. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant\">Many herbivorous species have complex adaptations to help digestion<\/a>. Therefore, it's not necessarily easy, or easier, to evolve to eat only vegetation. <strong>Improved energy acquisition can evolve by both eating more energy rich foods and by more efficiently extracting energy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Carnivory is also present in plants. According to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.022057199\">this paper<\/a><sup> <strong>[2]<\/strong><\/sup>, such plants may be an adaptation to nutrient poor conditions, where the ability to digest insects (and other small animals) would be a massive benefit, allowing carnivory to evolve rapidly. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Botanical carnivory is thought to have evolved in nutrient-poor and\n  well-lit habitats such as bogs because the marginal benefits accruing\n  from carnivory exceed the marginal photosynthetic costs associated\n  with the maintenance of carnivorous organs.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The egyptian mongoose is an omnivore. <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/8364231/Food_and_feeding_ecology_of_the_Egyptian_Mongoose_Herpestes_ichneumon_Linnaeus_1758_in_Egypt\">This species varies it's diet across the year, according to what is available<\/a>. For example, insects are the major component of its diet in spring, while no fish are eaten during summer (because of dry canals in the summer) and fish are a major component in the winter. This illustrates that allowing omnivory/carnivory can increase the resources available, potentially allowing better survival and reproduction relative to a herbivorous/narrow foraging strategy in the same species. Consider this problem in, for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_zone\">boreal or temperate climates<\/a>, where winter can cover ground vegetation in snow and tree's will reduce foliage. Consuming animals would allow the acquisition of energy and nutrients through the winter.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, carnivory can evolve because animals are a good and plentiful source of energy and nutrition, and may allow diversification of strategies, improving survival and reproduction<\/strong>. If animals were bad food sources then carnivory would be less common as it would be a more difficult/problemtaic behaviour to evolve. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While many people &amp; organisations (<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/living/food/natural-human-diet/\">including PETA<\/a>) try to claim that we are not well adapted to being carnivores, many of the claimed adaptations to herbivory/lack of adaptations to omnivory are overstated, misleadingly presented, and even false, and are used in order to promote their own agenda. It's also worth noting that we are not well adapted to being herbivores (e.g. gut flora) and <a href=\"http://www.allaboutwildlife.com/what-do-chimps-eat\">chimpanzees, one of our closest ancestors, are also omnivores<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>[1]<\/strong><\/sup> Krebs &amp; Davies <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioural-Ecology-Evolutionary-Approach-Edition/dp/0865427313\">Behavioural Ecology, An evolutionary approach.*<\/a> ISBN-10: 0865427313.<\/p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>[2]<\/strong><\/sup> Ellison, Aaron M., and Nicholas J.

One way would be including individuals as polytomies at the species level, but this would make the test quite hard to interpret.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance,\nDiogo<\/p>\n","question_id":43190,"tags":["evolution","data","methods","macroevolution"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":4,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aff0866587273eeae903c6bd2715b717?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":20146,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/20146/jack-m","reputation":116,"display_name":"Jack M"},"closed_date":1455168606,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":43187,"edited":false,"creation_date":1455109286,"comment_id":74607,"body":"A pre-existing answer is linked in the above comment.

Each definition can further be split into two different more detailed definitions. The reason for this slight mess is mainly historical. In short, a mutation can refer to<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An event\n\n<ul>\n<li>narrow sense<\/li>\n<li>broad sense<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>An allele\n\n<ul>\n<li>definition based on ancestral/derived states<\/li>\n<li>definition based on frequency<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Before going into the details of these definitions, it is important to first define a few other terms.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A few other definitions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The terms I want to define here are <em>Locus, polymorphic locus, allele, nucleotide and phenotype<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short (simplified version), a <strong>phenotype<\/strong> is the way an individual look. The variations of phenotypes of the individuals in a population depends upon the variation of genotypes and the variation of environments that they encounter. This concept is very much related to the concept of heritability. You may want to read more about it <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/why-is-a-heritability-coefficient-not-an-index-of-how-genetic-something-is\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DNA sequence is made of four <strong>nucleotides<\/strong>. It is the sequence of these nucleotides that affect the phenotype of an individual<\/p>\n\n<p>A <strong>locus<\/strong> is refers to the position of a DNA sequence of arbitrary length. At a given locus different types of sequence can exist, such a coding or non-coding sequence, a gene or just an intron, only a few codons, etc..<\/p>\n\n<p>An <strong>allele<\/strong> is one variant of a sequence (often a gene) at a given locus. If, in the population, more than one allele exists at a given locus, than the locus is said to be <strong>polymorphic<\/strong>. Most polymorphic loci have only two alleles. In such case we can talk about bi-allelic loci.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Mutation as an event<\/h1>\n\n<p>A mutation can refer to an event.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Narrow definition<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A mutation may refer to the event of a spontaneous change in the nucleotide sequence of an individual such as typically an indel (insertion or deletion of one or few nucleotides) or a substitution (substitution of a nucleotide by another one). In other words, a mutation can refer to the event of changing allele (eventually making up a new one) at a given locus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Broad definition<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The broad definition is similar to the narrow one expect that it encompass more types of genetic changes. In the broad sense, a mutation may refer more globally to any genetic spontaneous change. For example a whole chromosome deletion or a full genome duplication are examples of mutations.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my experience, most often when the term \"mutation\" is used, it is to refer to the broad definition of mutation.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Mutation as an allele<\/h1>\n\n<p>A mutation can refer to an allele. Note however that very often we prefer using the terms \"mutant allele\", \"mutant state\" or just \"mutant\" as synonym to refer to this allele. Pretty much the only circumstance in which we would use the term mutation her is in the sentences of the kind \"Individual <code>I<\/code> carries the mutation.\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition based one ancestral/derived states<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A mutation can also refer to the allele that is derived from a more ancestral allele. Consider for example, a given locus was NOT polymorphic in the past. A mutation (in the sense of \"event\") occurs and the locus is now polymorphic. The allele that has been created by the mutation (in the sense of \"event\") is sometimes called \"mutation\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition based on frequency<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A mutation can also refer to the allele that is at the lowest frequency in the population. For example, consider a bi-allelic locus with two alleles <code>A<\/code> and <code>B<\/code>. If the frequency of the allele <code>B<\/code> is lower than $\\frac{1}{2}$ (that is lower than the frequency of the allele <code>A<\/code>), then the allele <code>B<\/code> can be referred to as the mutation. The reason for calling \"mutation\" the allele that is at low frequency is that most mutations are deleterious and as a consequence the mutant allele is often at low frequency. As a consequence, using the <em>Definition based on frequency<\/em> and <em>Definition based one ancestral/derived states<\/em> is often not important.<\/p>\n\n<h1>To address your question specifically<\/h1>\n\n<p>It is a little hard to directly address your question as it seems to have several misunderstanding on the concept of mutation. In the same time however, it feels like you are turning around the realization that there are several definitions in use.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes you encounter the terminology that one has a mutation on both alleles (father's and mother's side). But why is that called a mutation and not just a variation? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The term mutation (whichever definition you pick) is intrinsically related to the concept of <em>variation in the population<\/em> but not so much to variation within a single individual (homozygote vs heterozygote).<\/p>\n\n<p>If an individuals <code>one has a mutation on both allele<\/code>, refers to the term mutation as an allele in the narrow sense and not as an event. More specifically it refers to one allele at a polymorphic locus (probably a locus of only one nucleotide) within the allele considered at the larger polymorphic locus considered.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does a mutation mean that it changed during lifetime<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A mutation (in the sense of event) is a change that if often view at the moment of reproduction but the mutation may have occurred anytime in the lineage of the germ cells. Note, one may consider also mutation that occurred (during the lifetime of the individual) but in the soma cells. Such mutation will NOT be transmitted to the offspring.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Or is there really a kind of standard taken where deviations are considered to be mutations?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well...yes! A deviation is a deviation to a reference. In other words, we can replace \"deviation\" by \"one allele of a polymorphic locus\" in your question. And yes, a mutation (in the sense of a given allele) can refers to one allele of a polymorphic locus.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43167,"question_id":43159,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1455057346},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2442ea911c89187262d6575d739a1ca7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5148,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5148/swbarnes2","reputation":1824,"display_name":"swbarnes2"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":43176,"edited":false,"creation_date":1455143920,"comment_id":74662,"body":"I have a hard time to think of any case where one could hesitate between using the term <code>mutation<\/code> or <code>variation<\/code> as one refer to either an event or an allele and the other refers to the existence of polymorphism."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1455058280,"creation_date":1455058280,"body":"<p>What I was taught by people in genomics is that \"variation\" is preferred for an allele that was not private to just one individual or family, but was found in pretty much unrelated individuals, while \"mutation\" is preferred for a very recently changed allele that is private to one individual or their family.

However, if swelling occurs on a more rapid time scale it is more likely that this fluid is from the damage of the impact itself and the cells and capillaries are leaking blood and extracellular fluids (<a href=\"http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/swelling-bodys-reaction-to-injury\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is Swelling?<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>In short, when you bump your head your body is trying to fight off further injury and infection by inducing the inflammatory response. It is also leaking fluids due to the impact and may result in rapid swelling at site of impact. The symptoms you discuss are due to inflammation and are a normal process of your body's defense mechanism.
