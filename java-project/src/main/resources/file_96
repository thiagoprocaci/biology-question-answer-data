You can also use a genome browser like the ucsc or ensembl."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7fca2db6ff3f4583df98043bd5166f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1856,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1856/atmosx","reputation":225,"display_name":"atmosx"},"score":0,"post_id":7192,"edited":false,"creation_date":1360712183,"comment_id":8858,"body":"Sure, already did!

I am leaving the information here since it may be useful to someone else. However, I recommend you focus on the UTRs since they are probably what is causing you problems. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are three things that could be causing you problems. I will briefly touch on each one. I will talk about <em>all<\/em> genes, bear in mind that bacteria have no introns so any discussion of splicing and/or introns and exons is not directly relevant to your problem.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. UTRs<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region\">Untranslated Regions (UTRs)<\/a> are sequences at the beginning and end of a gene that are not translated into protein. UTRs are regions that are part of the original genomic sequence, they are also part of the mature mRNA (indeed, UTRs are sometimes modified by splicing events, they are exons not introns) <em>but<\/em> they do not get translated into protein. To illustrate, have a look at this simplified representation of an mRNA molecule:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MtXrs.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Only the green exons will make it into the final protein. Introns are spliced out and UTRs are not translated. <\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if you translate the entire gene, you will not get the correct protein.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Reading frames<\/h2>\n\n<p>Genes are read in words of three letters (the codons). The sequence ATGTGTACCTGA has six possible reading frames (three on each strand) which can be read and translated as follows:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>5'3' Frame 1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>    ATG TGT ACC TGA\n     M   C   T  Stop\n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>5'3' Frame 2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>    a TGT GTA CCT ga\n       C   V   P    \n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>5'3' Frame 3<\/strong>    <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>    at GTG TAC CTG a\n        V   Y   L    \n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>3'5' Frame 1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>TCA GGT ACA CAT\n S   G   T   H  \n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>3'5' Frame 2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>t CAG GTA CAC at\n   Q   V   H    \n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>3'5' Frame 3<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>tc AGG TAC ACA t\n    R   Y   T    \n<\/code><\/pre><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>DNA is double stranded. The sequence of one strand is complementary to that of the other, therefore if you have one strand you can infer the sequence of its complementary one. Genes can be found on either strand, the two are equivalent biologically. However, sequencing projects <em>choose<\/em> one of the two strands (randomly) and call it the plus (+) strand and then save all sequences with respect to that strand. This means that sometimes the genomic sequence that you download from a database might be the complement of the actual sequence you are looking for. <\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Names<\/h2>\n\n<p>I once heard someone say in a conference that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Biologists would rather share a toothbrush than a gene name. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>While that might be a little exaggerated, naming conventions vary between research communities and species and databases. So, are you <em>sure<\/em> that you have downloaded the correct gene? Where did you get it from? How did you identify it? Does the sequence also contain up/downstream regulatory regions, promoters, enhancers and the like? If you post the exact sequence you are attempting to use I can give you more specific help.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the first 20 hits when <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=%28DNA%20Polymerase%203%29%20AND%20%22Escherichia%20coli%22%5Bporgn%3a__txid562%5D\">searching for the <em>E. coli<\/em> <code>DNA Polymerase 3<\/code> in ncbi's nucleotide database<\/a>, are whole genome shotgun sequences. These do <em>not<\/em> correspond to the gene sequence you are looking for. They are huge pieces of the genome (or even the entire genome) that will contain your gene and many others. Look at the Tools section below for suggestions on extracting your gene from the whole genome. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>4. Splicing (irrelevant to bacteria)<\/h2>\n\n<p>Another possible problem is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing\">splicing<\/a>. Lets start with the basics, the process of producing a eukaryotic (bacteria have no introns) protein from a genomic sequence is summarized in the image below (modified slightly from <a href=\"http://err.bio.nyu.edu/courses/index.php/Griffin\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MZRny.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Transcription begins at the transcription start site (TSS) but not all the transcribed sequence is translated into protein. First, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron\">introns<\/a> are spliced out of the mRNA to produce the <em>mature<\/em> mRNA (other things like capping and poly-A addition also occur but are not relevant here). So,the mature mRNA contains the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon\">exons<\/a> of the coding gene. This means that a linear translation of the gene's sequence will not correspond to the protein produced. You will need to take splicing into account. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, bear in mind that splicing will change the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame\">reading frame<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if the sequence <code>ATGT<\/code> were spliced at, for example, <code>AT/gt<\/code> (most splice events cut/join at GT/AG sites) and joined with the sequence <code>agATTATT<\/code>, the resulting (spliced) sequence would be (the splicing process will remove the <code>gt<\/code> from the first sequence and the <code>ag<\/code> from the second):<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>ATATTATT\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the reading frame has now changed. Where before, in the first reading frame, we had the codon <code>ATG<\/code>, the canonical translation initiation codon, we now have <code>ATA<\/code> which codes for isoleucine (I). I hope that is clear,  the main point is that splicing can change the reading frame.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>5. Tools<\/h2>\n\n<p>OK, that was the background. Now, what you will need to do is use existing programs that model splice sites and can correctly align a protein sequence to genomic DNA. My personal favorites are <a href=\"http://www.animalgenome.org/bioinfo/resources/manuals/exonerate/\">exonerate<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/genewise/\">genewise<\/a>. On a Debian-based Linux distribution, you can install them with this command:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install exonerate wise\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Then, to align the protein to its gene do:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>exonerate -m protein2genome -n 1 prot.fa dna.fa &gt; out.txt \n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>or<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>genewise -pep -pretty -gff -cdna prot.fa dna.fa &gt; out.txt \n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>In my experience exonerate is (much) faster but genewise is a little more accurate. I usually use exonerate if I am dealing with a whole genome and genewise if I only have a few kilobases of sequence. Both are very good and both will be able to align a protein to its genome of origin.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will not explain all these options because that is beyond the scope of this site. Have a look at their documentation (which is quite good and clear) and if you still have problems, you could ask a question over at <a href=\"http://www.biostars.org/\">biostars.org.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could link your web application to the <a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat\">ucsc genome browser<\/a> BLAT service.

If an enzyme for sequencing was more rigorously in time step that could help for instance.  The machines read traces in four channels with nice bumps for each base.  See <a href=\"http://www.codoncode.com/GSAposter/GSA_Adap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> for a nice example. You can see that if there are too many of the same base consecutively it gets hard to tell how many bases there are there.  Over time all four traces will start to smear out and you cant tell Adam from Thelma if you take my meaning. <\/p>\n\n<p>But there are other bottlenecks.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sequencers currently put out such a high volume of data that the analysis of the meaning of the output data can't be analyzed fast enough.  This follows the trend in biotech over the past 12 years or so - more sequence data, micro array data, more mutation data, more genomes than people who can actually use it to understand the biology.  There is a bit of an analysis bottleneck now. <\/p>\n\n<p>So some of these sequencers have greater read lengths, which can make it easier to assemble a sequence.  These sequencers generally cost more.  For instance if you have a library to sequence a little fungal or algal genome - you will get the answer back in a day or less now.  In the form of 1 Tb of reads maybe 50 to 200 bp long.

Asexual reproduction can be an advantage when environmental conditions are stable and an organism is well-adapted to its environment. The genetically identical off spring will also be adapted to that environment. Asexual reproduction is carried out by the different artificial propagation techniques. Artificial propagation is the cloning of a plant from a portion of its roots, stems, or leaves. In asexual reproduction in plants, also called vegetative propagation, new individuals are grown from a portion of the roots, stems, or leaves of the existing plant.

Once the seeds have been dispersed and if they have landed in an area that meets the requirements (sufficient water, warmth, and oxygen), they may begin to grow into seedlings or they may remain dormant.  If they have not landed in a suitable area they can remain dormant for hundreds or thousands of years and wait until they are transported to a suitable area to resume growth.  Eventually once the seeds have landed in a suitable area, the seed resumes the process of growth when the seed is able to absorb, the process of resuming growth after being dormant is called germination. The water causes the seed to swell and breaks open the seed coat. The stored food in the endospore or cotyledons begins to break down, and nutrients are made available to the embryo. The food and the presence of oxygen allow cellular respiration to occur, which provides energy to the embryo for growth. The first part of the embryo to appear outside the seed is a structure called the radicle, which starts absorbing water and nutrients from its environment, eventually the radicle develops into the plant\u2019s roots. The hypocotyl is the region of the stem nearest the seed. In many plants, it is the first part of the seedling to appear above the soil. In some dicots, as the hypocotyl grows it pulls the cotyledons and the embryonic leaves out of the soil. Photosynthesis begins as soon as the seedling\u2019s cells that contain chloroplasts are above the ground and exposed to light. In monocots, the cotyledon usually stays in the ground when the stem emerges from the soil. <\/p>\n","question_id":14209,"tags":["botany","plant-physiology","plant-anatomy"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":14213,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":122,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/384c7c67eead4b2a6864ef907fb17987?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5275,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5275/user3034084","reputation":83,"display_name":"user3034084","accept_rate":38},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/415fb73080f1d9f0922c80153f8e95a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5283,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5283/chris-cashwell","reputation":221,"display_name":"Chris Cashwell"},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/384c7c67eead4b2a6864ef907fb17987?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5275,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5275/user3034084","reputation":83,"display_name":"user3034084","accept_rate":38},"score":0,"post_id":14207,"edited":false,"creation_date":1388436419,"comment_id":18657,"body":"So as a seed matures it becomes dormant, and is than released and transported.

In fact, this is seen in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrifty_phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">thrifty phenotype<\/a> in humans. When the mother experiences a period of duress during her pregnancy (say, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_hunger_winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dutch Hunger Winter<\/a> of 1944), the fetus will undergo epigenetic changes that signal, in effect, that food is scarce and resources should be used sparingly.

In the face of a new change in environmental conditions, be it gradual or sudden, the species can only work from its current genetic background. So whether there is a specific theory that deals with this (aside from the examples given above) is not clear. I would think that what we will see with strong-but-gradual climate change is a progressive loss of biodiversity (due to the inability to adapt in time) followed by rapid expansion to fill newly opened niches. To that end, I guess Gould's \"Wonderful Life\" would be appropriate to read. Any book on Evo Devo would lend insight into understanding how species might be able to rapidly adapt to a slowly changing environment, albeit in an indirect/abstract manner (i.e. \"food for thought\"); I like Sean B.

This also means that the evolution of life histories and the tolerance of species to variability in environmental conditions are shaped by their life-history patterns. <\/p>\n\n<p>A consequence of this is that in a long-lived species (as an example), you should find larger variabilty in juvenile survival than in adult survival, since population growth rate is more sensitive to variability in the latter. The lower variability in adult survival can then be seen as an expression of \"hardiness\" to variability in environmental conditions, and this theory can therefore be used to understand likely evolutionary trajectories of different species, also under a climate change scenario. The ways to minimize the negative effects of variability in population growth in this theory is to either be hardy in important traits (change in environmental conditions doesn't translate much into variability in vital rate) or to decrease the sensitivity in vital rates that vary a lot (which amounts to modifying the life-history pattern of the species). Your question mainly deals with longevity, and this is influenced by both maturation age and adult survival. Therefore, this theory can be useful to think about which species should develop a \"hardy\" strategy. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, this answer completely ignores tipping-points in environmental tolerances, nonlinear responses and the genetic variation that selection can act on. <\/p>\n\n<p>Related articles you might want to check out are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462133\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Van de Pool et al. 2010.

It seems as if there are two macroevolutionary ways to deal with environmental change:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Have short generation times, and evolve fast. For instance, the mosquito <em>Wyeomyia smithii<\/em> is under selection by the warming climate in North America and it has shown an evolutionary repsonse. The response is \"detectable over a time interval as short as 5 years\" (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.241391498\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2001<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Be hardy, and 'try' to wait out changes. No real-world example to cite, but imagine a long-lived tree growing in an area that has become to warm for its seeds to effectively produce seedlings.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems intuitively like strategy 1 is better in the case of ongoing climate warming. However, we could easily imagine a 5-year hot spell followed by a return to the normal as part of natural weather variation. Perhaps in this situation strategy 2 is better.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, having a longevity/generation time/hardiness that matches the time-scale of the disturbance would be important \u2013 if the disturbance is long (or unidirectional) compared to your lifespan, evolving fast seems best; if the disturbance is short compared to your life, it seems best to wait it out.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the question is, is there theory that deals with this?

Where do all the myriad animals and plants come from.  IMHO its natural that you have these questions because your view is the more intuitive one.  In fact it was in some ways the dominant view of biology for over over a thousand years. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm going to take a different tack here and hold that the answer why nobody's going to abandon evolution is that there is no coherent theory (creationistic or otherwise) that even comes close to explaining what biologists see.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Science does not simply want to throw away a theory because there are blemishes - in fact there is no such theory in any of science that is complete and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems\">perfect and its been proven mathematically<\/a>.  We have to have another theory that is better at explaining what is known and people will migrate to it. <\/p>\n\n<p>In fact this is what nearly every scientist I know finds so magnetic about the pursuit.  Any Joe with a garage lab has a chance (however small!) in finding the next great discovery, of upending the current order of things.  It has happened several times in fact.  But its also fair to say that it is not so easy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Its interesting to note that it was fairly recently (19th century) that all educated people assumed that the forms of animals were directly ordained by God - created perfect for the environment in which they found themselves.   <\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, basically this sort of creationism was the dominant theory of all living things (I'm giving it a more modern title, but it seems to fit.).  But that did end for most people when they reviewed Darwin's arguments.  That theory was found to have several flaws that just could not be ignored and was thrown out as being too imperfect.  Evolution is in place because it was found to be more perfect than the previous theory.  Anything that follows it will have to do so for anyone who really cares to think about it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of things that Darwin explained so clearly that have not really been explained any other way. Others may fill in the comments to improve this list, but this can get things started:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) <em>We have seen lots of cases where species appeared from previous ones.<\/em>  Previous to Darwin, animals and plants came directly from the mind of God.  The creator would conceive of a perfect animal who would live on an arid mountain and just put them there.  This was satisfactory in that you would go from one mountain to another and find pretty much the same goats and plants.  But when Darwin performed a survey over most of the world, and in particular in the Galapagos Island, he found different animals to be living identical environments  on different islands.  This is evolution observed directly- we now understand that islands get new animals very rarely and so a single group of birds can then speciate after they arrive on an island and take up niches (lifestyles) that other animals would have in europe say.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches\">Darwins' finches<\/a> who eat different kinds of bugs are a good example of cases where its clear new species just popped up because there was time enough and food enough for them to do so.  Islands have lots of other more obvious cases.  The big birds of the south pacific, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa\">the moa could reach 12 feet high<\/a> and didn't even have wings.  They ate plants and could run like the dickens - its basically a deer.  Where did these species come from, if not from others which landed on the island and turned into monsters and midget birds?  <\/p>\n\n<p>2) <em>The theory of natural selection and evolution pretty much predicted the discovery of DNA and allowed the rigorous relationship between all living things on earth to be established<\/em>.  The discovery of DNA illustrates that all living things are almost related to each other.  They share the same genes, the older families of genes are the most widely found amongst not only animals, but also plants fungi and bacteria.  If there were no evolutionary tree where species radiated from common ancestors why do different species relate to each other so clearly ? No one who looks at the DNA sequences would question that we are related to yeast just as surely as a paternity test shows a father and son are related.  I see no great outcry against genetic paternity tests, but they use the same argument. <\/p>\n\n<p>No, nobody who really cares about knowledge is just going to forget about evolution.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I may add more here, but this is getting long. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just to go further into some of your examples though:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>'I can't change my DNA if I want to get taller'<\/em>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Not yet, because we are still learning.  Gene therapy treatments that are being worked on change the DNA of your cells to get rid of <a href=\"http://www.asgct.org/about_gene_therapy/diseases.php\">diabetes, cancer, hemophilia and others<\/a>.  There is biological treatment for some dwarfism.  The very complicated genetic factors that determine your height are poorly understood, but in principle it could happen.  I am average height and I don't really want to be taller - not sure why this particular problem deserves a lot of interest.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":5160,"question_id":5157,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5157/i-believe-in-variation-of-a-species-but-not-in-evolution","last_activity_date":1388194420,"creation_date":1352341114,"answer_count":1,"title":"I believe in variation of a species but not in evolution","body":"<p>I can see that variation within species exists, for example birds with various size beaks adapted for specific food-gathering purposes, one may have a larger beak vs. smaller beak, OK that works for me. So my question is, where did the whole bird design come from or cat or dog or mouse? I see no transitional fossil for all the different life forms on Earth. <\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, the fossil record is incomplete, but surely there should be more evidence. Another question, if a rhino's horn was evolved for digging and fighting for better survival, how does that rhino say, \"hey I'm going to change my DNA to make life easier for me with this horn\"?<\/p>\n\n<p>How does this change really occur? I can't change my own DNA if I want to be taller. Now, you will tell me, that the rhino's horn evolved from female rhinos finding bigger horns more attractive over millions of years, and the evolutionary process begins because they picked larger horns.

Stress-induced Experimentation Hypothesis<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The likelihood of conjugation/transformation occurring may change for a bacterial population as a whole depending on how stressed it is (or perhaps how unfamiliar the environment is?). Stress signals could cause the population to be more \"risky\" and take up the DNA from surrounding living/dead bacteria and incorporate it with its own genome: \"the hell, we're out of options.. lets transform into something that resembles the indigenous species of this strange ecosystem!\". Indeed Bacteria have memory (see: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis\" rel=\"nofollow\">chemotaxis<\/a>) this means that perhaps they can be able to tell whether they have been receiving more stress <em>now<\/em> as opposed to <em>before<\/em>, meaning they can \"trial and error\" with various genes that have been imported within their plasmids! \u2014 \"Let's try this gene, oh wait... I'm dying, hmm let's kill off this plasmid and take some more genes!\".<\/p>\n\n<p>In reply to this my course convener said: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ah yes, a switch from asexual to sexual reproduction occurs in\n  many organisms under stress. The genes that cause the\n  sex/transformation to occur may gain a net benefit from recombination\n  with genes taken from other organisms/the environment.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2. Diversity Plagarism Hypothesis<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>If we look at the entire population of conjugating bacteria as a single competitive unit itself (e.g. like a tissue is a coordinated group of specialized cells) that can compete with other populations of bacteria who cannot conjugate the conjugating population will \"win\". This is because a conjugating population will always have much higher phenotypical diversity as it can mix traits between the individuals. This means a conjugating population is much more efficient at undergoing natural selection for beneficial traits or trait combinations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Think of natural selection (coupled with mutation) as an <strong>inventor<\/strong>... something that helps you invent much \"fitter bacteria\" is the ability to pull things apart from this bacterium and that bacterium and glue them together, this is essentially what conjugation/transformation does!! it allows you to pull bits from this bacterium and stick it to bits from that bacterium to get a \"super-bacterium\". It's like open source technology (free to share) as opposed to patented technology!! Conjugation is immediately a good thing because it means you can \"steal\" cool technology from living/dead bacteria and incorporate it into your population's gene pool!<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this was helpful!<\/p>\n","answer_id":13718,"question_id":13708,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1388194401}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13708/does-conjugation-support-gene-selection","last_activity_date":1388194401,"creation_date":1385721151,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does conjugation support gene selection?","body":"<p>I have already posted this on chat but haven't got any response.

The process of making a highly specific antibody (I'll focus on monoclonals) has three important parts - antigen design and immunization, cloning and subcloning, and screening/validation. Each part is crucial on its own, and the better one is performed, the higher your chances of success downstream become.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order for an antibody to work, it needs to bind specifically to its target. I won't get into all the specifics here, as there is a good open literature on antigen design, but basically you need something that will promote a strong immune response in the host, give you a variety of clones to choose from, and be specific - it shouldn't bind other targets besides your protein of interest. There are lots of factors to consider, including antigenicity, solubility, ease of production (for immunizing and screening), steric considerations (does another protein or nucleic acid obscure the target site <em>in vivo<\/em>?), and others. Antigens can be roughly divided into two types - peptides (typically less than 20 or 30 amino acids) and proteins or protein fragments. You will most likely want to try several antigens to maximize your probability of success. After the antigen is synthesized and purified, you need to come up with an immunization schedule for priming and boosting the animal(s), then determine when and how to test them (screening), and at what time and how to harvest it for the monoclonal process.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cloning process then comes next. Clones can be generated by a variety of methods, some widely available, such as the various hybridoma methods, and some proprietary to individual companies. My former company employed a mix of both, depending on the species of animal, using some really cool in-house tech that was constantly being improved and expanded upon. These processes are very dependent on the quality of materials being used and the expertise of the cloners. The input B cells (which make the antibodies) need to have been harvested, treated, and stored according to a set of precise steps to allow for the highest number of viable clones. Once the immortalized cells have been obtained (after fusion with the myeloma partner cells in the hybridoma process, for example) they are diluted to a pre-determined cell count and plated in 96-well plates and allowed to recover and grow for a time, during which they are secreting antibodies into the medium. This media is then tested quickly (before the cells overgrow the well), and positive wells are diluted out to (hopefully) single-cell suspensions and subcloned, or frozen down for later. The first testing is frequently by ELISA using the immunizing antigen, although depending on your application of interest it may be by high-throughput screening via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. After the initial testing, subsequent steps of subcloning and re-testing can occur at a more measured pace, as the cells can be frozen indefinitely after generating sufficient quantities of antibodies in the supernatant. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is where the quality of your screening program comes in. Your assays need to be well-designed, robust, well-documented and performed, and have appropriate positive and negative controls so that you can truly tell whether a certain clone is of interest, or performs better than an existing product. This means controlled conditions, standardized reagents and protocols, and a high degree of repeatability from assay to assay. Also, the appropriateness of your controls cannot be emphasized enough. Do you have a knockout or non-expressing sample for comparison, or a way of looking at baseline vs. induced or inhibited activity? For ChIP, unless you have a good control antibody and primer pair for your gene of interest, how will you know if the assay works? You may get a great result doing a straight immunoprecipitation-Western blot, but still not pull down DNA-bound protein. If your ChIP method doesn't produce clean DNA, you may never get binding. And if you don't have appropriate data analysis protocols in place with multiple replicate wells, you may waste time chasing noise instead of specific signal. Additionally, along with testing all your clones, you also need to titrate them to determine the optimal working concentration. I've seen a lot of antibodies that look like crap when you first test the supe, but diluted 100 or 1000X they are clean, specific, and still strong. Be patient, testing is a lot of work and requires a ton of repetition to confirm your results, but it'll be well worth it in the end.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, after all this is done, you hopefully have a great clone that does what you want it to do, and better than anything else out there. You now need to decide what you're going to do with it, because if you're an academic lab and publish with it, the world will come knocking at your door. Don't slack off at the end and decide 100 ml of supernatant will be enough to last forever - save the clones and put them in a cell bank, or try to get a commercialization deal with a manufacturing company so you don't have to do all the work!<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps, please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5185,"question_id":3564,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1352489530},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8f52a4feb50530e2cbaef33d833d4cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1656,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1656/kt8","reputation":76,"display_name":"KT8"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1388192294,"creation_date":1352815694,"body":"<p>Answering Konrad's comment, you produce the peptide or protein of interest using bacteria or chemically synthesize them (chemical synthesis generally only work for short peptide chains.

One of the establishing principles of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was to store not only the models (atomic positions and identities) of macromolecules and proteins, but also the originating X-ray data, more recently in structure factors. <\/p>\n\n<p>If the question is 'why are they giving only the structure factors and not the original data they took' - such a task would require a lot of curation effort for very little scientific benefit.   Scaling the individual sets of data from the detector used to be a bear of a task.  The <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm_disscussed_entry.do?id=1mbn\" rel=\"nofollow\">original myoglobin structure<\/a> would entail scanned films in an ancient format from the 50s.  Nobody would be able to use that now without hacking the image format, if it wasn't on paper tape or cards.  In fact in that case the structure factors are not available.  Scaling many or several data collections together was often done with custom tweaks into the 70s and then in the 90s data collection became more routine, but several generations of x-ray detectors became popular and then faded from the market.  Each had its own eccentricities and requirements for combining data sets from multiple reads.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The purpose of having structure factors available is to allow anyone to reconstruct the electron density and evaluate the interpretive act which is tracing a peptide through electron density.  Since that format is mainly independent of the detector and has been fairly consistent over the years, it delivers a significant amount of scientific bang for the buck.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you want raw image data or detector-proprietary data before multiple data sets from different crystals before they were combined you will have to contact the authors, who would probably have to sift through a sea of DVDs to get to it.  In older cases it might be tapes. <\/p>\n\n<p>So as far as Structure factors, which are essentially the square root value of the combined and scaled Intensity data, they are available and a part of every submission to the pdb:  <\/p>\n\n<p>Look on any X-ray Structure Page at RCSB.

Check the \"Structure Factors\" box.  Raw intensity data should be available if you look around for it as well. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Suggestion<\/strong>:  I was thinking that if you look at the scaling software that comes with the X-ray detectors you might find some tutorials with unscaled raw data.

Before the surgery, I discovered I could reach back to the tonsils with my tongue, enabling me to remove the tonsil stones that built up. Gross, I know, but I believe it actually did make the infection noticeably better. After the surgery, and after the area had healed, I resumed discovering the back of my throat and, eventually, up the nasal cavity, all the way to the back of the nasal septum, which means I can reach the Eustachian tubes, adenoids, and posterior nares. If that sounds impossible, I assure you, it is perfectly achievable, and only mildly uncomfortable. With my tongue I can feel the texture of the adenoids but, more toward the posterior nares, this texture changes and resembles folds or crypts like I remember the texture of the palatine tonsils.

Pieces of DNA can float around and occasionally be spliced into a chromosome.  Most such integrated pieces are entirely nonfunctional (the functional version remaining in the mitochondria) and can pretty much be considered junk despite being replicated when the chromosome is replicated.  Useless gene-like pieces are often called nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes or NUMTs (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.pseudogene.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pseudogene.net<\/a>).  NUMTs are of technical importance because they interfere with genome studies: the sequences of the NUMTs can easily be mistaken for true mitochondrial DNA leading to false conclusions about mitochondrial genomes.<\/p>\n\n<p>A more general term is <em>endosymbiotic gene transfer<\/em>, which can be used to describe nuclear DNA which was derived from DNA originally residing in mitochondria but now is no longer found there.  Some of this is nonfunctional, but much is functional, coding for proteins which after translation are sent to the mitochondria.  In fact, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_genetics#Contribution_of_mitochondrial_versus_nuclear_genome\" rel=\"nofollow\">overwhelming majority<\/a> of mitochondrial proteins are coded by the nucleus, many of which probably had a mitochondrial origin. <\/p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotes do vary in how much nuclear DNA is of mitochondrial origin.

One reason light is not required immediately is that many seeds are in essence bundles of stored energy (as carbohydrates, I suppose). This is what makes them attractive food for birds, squirrels, humans, etc. When they're able to escape that predation, the growing plant can use that stored energy, rather than relying only on sunlight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evolutionary. Seed dormancy can be a powerful tool for fitness \u2013 seeds that can remain dormant and germinate during favorable conditions could have a much higher survival rate. These conditions vary from simple: \"spring\" to more complex: \"after having passed through the digestive system of a certain animal\"; \"after a forest fire\"; \"when there's a gap in canopy cover / less competition for solar energy\". The cues that seeds \"read\" in order to try to break dormancy and germinate during these times therefore vary among species.

Its not cut and dried, but I think its quite possible that risky behavior increases. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>T. gondii<\/em> is a parasite whose typical life cycle includes both mice and cats as hosts.  The transmission involves the mice being eaten by a cat.  Mice infected with T gondii will tend to lose some interest in being sheltered in close spaces and wander out into open spaces.  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/parasite-makes-mice-lose-fear-of-cats-permanently-1.13777\" rel=\"nofollow\">They also lose their fear of cats<\/a>.   That is a permanent change even if the mice are cleared of the parasite.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Other animals, such as humans are secondary hosts - they can become infected by handling or close proximity to cat feces, who have a nearly 50% (45.6%) infection rate themselves. As a result toxoplasmosis is very common in humans.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Toxoplasmosis has been found to <a href=\"http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/3/757.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">increase novelty seeking and increases risk seeking behavior<\/a> at least in men.

The personality of infected women, by contrast, showed higher warmth and higher superego strength (factors A and G on Cattell's 16PF), suggesting that they were more warm hearted, outgoing, conscientious, persistent, and moralistic. Both men and women had significantly higher apprehension (factor O) compared with the uninfected controls.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The correlation between toxoplasmosis and lower intelligence is a matter of debate, at least in this review I cite.  <a href=\"http://lineu.icb.usp.br/~farmacia/artigos/toxo_comp_rev.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Its still not clear whether it is a sociological correlation<\/a> - do smart people just handle their cat poo more carefully or not at all? <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23593448\" rel=\"nofollow\">This more recent study<\/a> shows that some factors might make infected humans <em>more<\/em> intelligent and some researchers see toxoplasmosis as a transformative factor in humans ability to generate and use technologies. <\/p>\n\n<p>I do see those links suggesting less risky behavior too.  Some say that the increase in traffic accidents is related to lower muscular coordination for instance.  There is evidence on both sides, but looking at what <em>T gondii<\/em> does to mice, I would bet that some risk behavior will increase.  As such, I'd guess that researchers as such might have a slightly higher rate of toxoplasmosis, but maybe you will do a study and help figure this out!<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said - anyone who tries to link a single phenomenon; host-parasite interactions; a drug; a gene; a mutation to a phenotype with a simple description is definitely oversimplifying.

I can give a couple of examples, but this is an extremely broad question.  Wet science is not cheap might be the message here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gene Ontology terms are meant to cover all biological roles known for genes.  Terms are added and retire regularly.  They embody thousands of person-years of work to establish the framework of what is going on in cells.  At the same time its a <a href=\"http://www.geneontology.org/GO.doc.shtml#not\" rel=\"nofollow\">limited vocabulary of gene behavior<\/a>.  It doesn't represent a complete catalog of all known gene behaviors (e.g. in such detail that it could only be the property of a specific gene) and it is also uneven in the level of its detail of its leaf terms.  Its an ontology that is manually assembled and edited and therefore subjective. <\/p>\n\n<p>I just did an overview of GO 1.2.  there are 34153 unique GO terms.  That's easily 10s of thousands of separate assays, so picking a group of important ones might be useful. There are also lots of orphan GO terms, where only one gene is currently attached to the term.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For GO annotations, a simple and typical case is a metabolic gene which has a high homology to a known gene and you are only trying to verify that biological role, and you have a functioning biological laboratory.  <\/p>\n\n<p>A breakdown might be:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clone the gene ( \\$200 to \\$1000 and up): order primers, use PCR to insert the gene into a plasmid or get the gene synthesized if you have to, transform it into bacteria,  ideally sequence it to make sure you have it right. <\/li>\n<li>purify the protein ( \\$500 maybe).  Run a check culture to see if the protein is produced, then run a full culture with induction, lyse it and then purify on an affinity chromatography column.  you may need to run a second column to get the protein pure. <\/li>\n<li>do a kinetics study with mass spectroscopic validation of the products (minimally about \\$300).  Cost involves reagents - if you have an assay you can use a UV/Vis spectrophotometer this can be simple, if not it can be much more expensive. This part will vary with the enzyme you are looking at. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Hopefully you get all these steps right the first time.  Salaries are not included in this cost.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The more complicated the GO term, the more difficult the work will be - they are not all equal.  If the protein function can't be verified in isolation, but must be <em>in situ<\/em> (i.e. in the living organism). Then you start to get into time.  What if your gene is involved in <a href=\"http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/term_details?term=GO:0071985\" rel=\"nofollow\">protein routing<\/a> through the <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0005802\" rel=\"nofollow\">golgi apparatus<\/a> and modulates the function of other proteins for instance?  That's going to require a very specialized and difficult set of experiments that should involve someone with experience in that field. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finding GO annotations which are not clear from sequence similarity - unknown functions or new genes which reflect previously unestablished GO Terms could cost even more and take a good deal longer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Still, high throughput studies are being done to find and validate electronic GO annotations.  And with that scale, the cost per experiment will go down.  Take a look at <a href=\"http://reducio.princeton.edu/cm/node/14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olga Troyanskaya's research<\/a> for an example of such an effort. <\/p>\n","answer_id":13995,"question_id":13988,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1387304087}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13988/how-much-does-a-biological-experiment-to-validate-a-gene-function-cost","last_activity_date":1387304087,"creation_date":1387150607,"answer_count":1,"title":"How much does a biological experiment to validate a gene function cost?","body":"<p>I am computer scientist working on machine learning methods applied to predicting missing Gene Ontology annotations. \nIn many papers, I wrote that my computational methods are very useful to suggest to the biologists  on which gene functions they should address their research, because my software need less resources (a simple laptop connected to a database) and less time (e.g. with a dataset of all the Homo sapiens Gene Ontology annotations: about 3 hours) than their biological experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now a reviewer asked me to be more precise.

Although most of the damage of HIV is caused by its infection of shorter lived cells, long lived cells which it infects includes anything with adequate receptors including memory T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and some glial cells too. These cells are found widespread in the body from tissues to the blood stream. HIV also infects an as of yet unknown pool, which is thought to be the cause of rebound after HART (Highly Active Retroviral Therapy) is stopped. <\/p>\n\n<p>The constant parts are not exactly there. Every part of HIV can essentially mutate and does. In functional HIV particles (which surprisingly make up a tiny proportion of total HIV particles in an infected individual), the epitopes you mentioned are mostly constant. <\/p>\n\n<p>Destroying them is impossible as of yet and hence no cure for HIV. It is hard to destroy a particular protein. We could make HIV that doesn't make these proteins (it would then rapidly mutate until it did, or be non-functional to the point it was an awful vaccine not inducing a particularly adept CD8 response). Otherwise we could block either these proteins themselves or that which they bind. There is a group of individuals with the delta 32 mutation which blocks CCR5 preventing infection, however this is rare. For the most part most individuals are susceptible as CD4 and CCR5 are highly conserved amongst humans. We would benefit therefore from inhibitors of these proteins themselves, however due to glycosylation generally our antibodies are terrible at inhibiting the glycoproteins. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors exist and are in fact very important as part of HART.<\/p>\n\n<p>HIV came from chimpanzees. In their natural host the HIV equivalent (SIV) doesn't cause immunosuppression. HIV doesn't infect quite a few primates due to restriction factors which do not exist in humans or do not target the same things. Then of course there's the matter of the lack of the correct receptors. There's ongoing research if there's a chemical that does cure HIV however there isn't a subset of individuals where this occurs to study. HIV resistance is normally due to elite control of the virus due to specific genetic features that make the immune system target the best least variable, most deleterious (if HIV mutates them to escape) epitopes. If we could get everyone to respond to these epitopes that would be great (see a billion vaccine trials for HIV) otherwise if we could flush out the cells where it hides latently integrated (our current therapy and the immune system can only target cells where HIV is constantly replicating). <\/p>\n","answer_id":9355,"question_id":9338,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1374332582},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08613e0b782cdf2bb8f2501cae9bdc5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":806,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/806/armatus","reputation":5317,"display_name":"Armatus","accept_rate":81},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08613e0b782cdf2bb8f2501cae9bdc5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":806,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/806/armatus","reputation":5317,"display_name":"Armatus","accept_rate":81},"score":0,"post_id":10639,"edited":false,"creation_date":1380556110,"comment_id":14131,"body":"Here&#39;s a list of FDA-approved drugs against HIV: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/byAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm118915.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">fda.gov/ForConsumers/byAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/&hellip;<\/a>"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1380647699,"creation_date":1380555608,"body":"<p>To answer your title question: Yes, that is a valid principle of curing HIV. In fact that's pretty much the basic idea behind treating any infection.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>1) HIV strains use a combination of two receptors to enter a cell: CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5. It can infect and hide out in any cell which expresses both of these receptors; namely CD4+ T cells and some macrophages.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2) Yes. Except that there are populations of dormant CD4+ T cells in some hard-to-reach tissues such as lymph nodes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>3 &amp; 4) There are currently five strategies against HIV, and each strain may be vulnerable against one of them but not another - or may develop resistance during treatment. This is why HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) always comprises drugs of three different strategies. An article recommended to me on this is <a href=\"http://perspectivesinmedicine.org/content/2/2/a007385.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shattock and Rosenberg, 2012: Microbicides: Topical Prevention against HIV<\/a>. Or in particular, this graphic from the article is a great summary: <a href=\"http://perspectivesinmedicine.org/content/2/2/a007385/F1.expansion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://perspectivesinmedicine.org/content/2/2/a007385/F1.expansion.html<\/a>. Briefly: Drugs either inhibit viral entry into a cell by blocking the receptors mentioned above; or they target the viral reverse transcriptase (two strategies for this one), integrase or protease. *)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>5) No - although partial activity by the drugs against human enzymes is the cause of side effects.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>6) Yes, and we are doing so already (or rather, take them orally - no need for bothersome injections). The only problem is that the above-mentioned dormant cell populations are already infected and have integrated HIV, but it is not being active and hence not noticed by the immune system and not affected by our drugs. As long as HAART is maintained, viral loads in the blood are reduced to near-zero and the patient is for all intents and purposes healthy (including not transmitting HIV) - any latent virus that activates will immediately be wiped out. However, when HAART is interrupted even briefly, the virus can relapse.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Reaching those dormant populations is the focus of current research. If a person starts HAART very shortly after initial infection, before the virus can reach those populations, it is possible to cure them.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of third world, the problem is not the drugs but getting them to the people who need them (money, transport, distribution, legal systems, civil wars etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>*) These are not simply 'chemical X from virus' and 'destroy chemical X'. Our drugs do not destroy the viral particles themselves but prevent them from replicating in a live system. If you mix HIV particles and the drugs in a test tube, leave it for 20min, filter the particles out and inject them into somebody, you will still infect them.
