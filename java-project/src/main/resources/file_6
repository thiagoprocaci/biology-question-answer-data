If the cell is in stress or has low amounts of nutrients, the lysogenic pathway is typically activated.<\/p>\n\n<p>The underlying mechanism has to do with a protein cascade involving either the cro or cI protein that is encoded by the virus. The cI protein is a repressor, and it will prevent the lytic genes from being transcribed. By default the virus will transcribe the lytic genes, so they must be repressed for lysogeny to occur. Similarly, cro is also a transcriptional repressor. The two proteins work in opposition to each other. cro binds to an operator, oR3, that is involved in repressing cI, which may prevent cI from being expressed and thus preventing it from repressing lytic genes (however the importance of this is debatable because if you replace oR3, the cell can apparently still lyse).<\/p>\n\n<p>There are numerous other proteins, such as N and Q, that are involved. The N protein has to be transcribed by the polymerase \u2018anti-terminating\u2019, or reading through a termination signal. This will happen more frequently when the protein RNase III is present at high concentrations. The N protein is a lytic regulator. Thus, when there are high amounts of RNase III there will be more N expressed which leads to the lytic cycle. RNase III is not a viral protein. It is a host protein and the host expresses more of it when nutrients are abundant. This is how the virus is able to \u2018sense\u2019 if nutrients are high enough to enter the lytic cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>The whole system is way more complicated but this is it in a nutshell.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.113656\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.113656<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":9794,"question_id":9787,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9787/what-decides-whether-a-lysogenic-cycle-or-a-lytic-cycle-will-take-place","last_activity_date":1460318163,"creation_date":1376564499,"answer_count":1,"title":"What decides whether a lysogenic cycle or a lytic cycle will take place?","body":"<p>A virus can either participate in a lysogenic cycle or a lytic cycle.

Living organisms create and maintain a bubble that is very far removed from thermal equilibrium. So, you can speculate that at the origin of life, conditions existed where processes that are far from thermal equilibrium could still occur naturally without the support structures one finds inside living cells. This suggests conditions involving very low temperatures e.g. in comets.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you consider complex molecules forming in comets then some unstable intermediary molecule can be metastable at the low temperatures there. Chemical compounds will only react with their immediate neighbor, not with molecules that are a bit farther away. This allows for intermediary unstable compounds to be created and to survive for long enough until it gets a chance to undergo further reactions making it more stable. Of course many more unstable molecules will be formed in such a process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine this happening in a comet kicked out from the Oort cloud that is periodically coming close to the Sun for a short while. When it is far away from the Sun, chemical reactions induced by cosmic rays happen in the interior which creates all sorts of strange chemical compounds. When it comes close to the Sun part of the comet melts and then some of the chemicals formed can disperse. The molecules that are more stable will have a better survival probability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Darwinian selection of molecules may thus happen inside comets and that may have led to RNA molecules and many of the proteins and enzymes that we today find inside cells.

Its abstract says:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oils lower the plasma concentrations\n  of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins in humans. The present study was designed to examine the mechanism(s) by which diets enriched in omega-3 fatty acids reduce plasma LDL cholesterol levels in normal subjects.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the <strong>Dicussion<\/strong> part, you will find your answer:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reductions in the plasma concentrations of LDL in human subjects consuming diets rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils or omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils may be due to a reduction in LDL synthesis, an increased fractional rate of catabolism of LDL, or a combination of both... The present study indicates that the hypocholesterolemic effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids present in fish oils results from a reduction in the rate of LDL apoprotein B synthesis and that such oils do not stimulate the fractional rate of catabolism of LDL. These observations imply that the incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into cellular or lipoprotein lipids does not enhance the rate of receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL as has been observed with omega-6 fatty acids in vitro.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IphBF.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IphBF.png\" alt=\"The Effects of Dietary Omega-3 Fatty Acids upon the Fatty Acid Composition of Plasma Phosphollplds and Cholesterol Esters\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I could not find a paper on its exact mechanism, so I'd rather say that the process is still not clear. Yet, as the paper suggests, the main effects of omega-3 fatty acids are reducing LDL synthesis and/or increasing fractional rate of catabolism (FRC) of LDL.<\/p>\n\n<p>A similar article can be found <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/features/low-cholesterol-diet-fatty-fish\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to lower triglycerides, which are a type of fat in the bloodstream.

In an important review of studies, researchers found that getting daily omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil could lower triglyceride levels by 25%-30%.

This trial was one of a number of studies that attempted to address the clinical question as to why LDL-cholesterol levels increase in patients treated with the triglyceride-lowering omega-3 fatty acids.

Just as a control you might have to do a complete LRS to see if you get any patterns in their egg laying behaviour, which I assume/believe is a decreasing pattern over time but just check the pattern of your WT and make sure your food is the same throughout all your experiments as changes in yeast % can completely distort your results as fly lay eggs like crazy when given yeast!! so use the same batch of fly food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although I'm no expert at this, if you look at female ovaries and do some molecular/phenotypic characterisations, you might get some interesting data if you are already observing a huge difference between your populations although you would have to look at the literature for this but having played around with these stuff a little, you find a surprising amount of data! This is in a way nice since you take the males out of the equation as the reproductive fitness could be compromised by either males or females in a population. To determine this you need to cross the males and females of your population of interest to WT flies and count the embryos (although this is slightly dangerous since if males are not performing well, females can lay lots of unfertilised eggs, blanks, and they are indistinguishable from fertilised egg so maybe count the hatched offspring and immediately discard them although that presents its own set of challenges and variables and to be honest its not likely to happen since you usually get this blanks in virgin females that have not yet courtshiped). If you observe lets say no changes in embryo numbers when your male populations are crossed to WT females but significant changes when females are crossed to the WT males, you would know the problem is with the males in your population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: So I looked a bit further into this and came across this paper (<a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024560\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024560<\/a>). If you look at Fig 6, I think it answers your question. I'm basically quoting the paper here. They measured the correlations between adult LRS and cumulative and short-time measures of fecundity and offspring production. Correlations of the short-time measures of fecundity and offspring production with adult LRS were highly dependent on the time of measurement. For young females the correlations were low, but when measured from older females, the correlations were much higher (up to 0.67 for short-time fecundity and 0.83 for short-time offspring production). For both short-time fecundity and short-time offspring production the highest correlations with adult LRS were reached when the female age was about 50 to 80 days. The length of the time frame had only a minor effect: the correlation of the 10-day measure with adult LRS was generally only slightly higher than that of the 2-day measure. The short-time measures performed well in comparison to the cumulative measures of fecundity and offspring production. So in short if you let your females age a bit and measure their fecundity, then it should be representative of their LRS.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17318,"question_id":11351,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1399888325},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1459408498,"creation_date":1404390651,"body":"<p>Just finished an experiment (yesterday) where I measured lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of a few hundred flies, with measures taken from 24 hours of production every 7 days over the entire life of the fly.

Electrocardiograms are the exception in this regard. The trick then is to get the event-related signal out of the noise.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is done by <em>multiple repetitions<\/em> of the \"event\" combined with <em>signal averaging<\/em>. You mark the electrical record with the time of each event, line up portions of the record by the event markers, and average the lined-up signals around the multiple events. This can be the full waveform for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">sensory evoked potentials<\/a>, or if you are examining action potentials in a nerve, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17753210\" rel=\"nofollow\">histogram of post-event occurrence times of action potentials<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The particular signal-processing mechanisms used have evolved with technology. I'm old enough to have known people who 60 years ago recorded electric neural activity on magnetic tape and processed the data, after analog-to-digital conversion, on what were then state-of-the art computers with 65,000 words of memory. Even then, there was discussion about the best technologies to use for specific purposes, as <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/4470\" rel=\"nofollow\">this 1959 MIT monograph<\/a> indicates.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main problem, the low level of event-related signals to the noise from other electrical activity, still remains 60 years later. The noise is biologic rather than technical, so more recent improvements have more to do with ease and speed of processing rather than the fundamental signal-to-noise problem. For event-related potentials, use whatever technology allows you to collect the electrical data along with linked notations of the event times, then to average the signals synchronized on the events to build up the signal out of the noise. In a standard clinical application of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem_auditory_evoked_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">brainstem auditory evoked potentials<\/a> to evaluate hearing, you may need to average over 500 or more stimulus presentations.<\/p>\n\n<p>This signal-in-noise problem is also seen in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function, which must consider not only the signal over time but also differences among brain regions within individuals and differences among individuals. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia page on fMRI<\/a> goes into some detail on methods for getting specific signals out of the background noise. You should pay particular attention to the issue of \"Block versus event-related design\" on that page. My understanding is that for \"events\" of the type that you consider, like \"thinking about a turtle,\" the block design works best in fMRI. The paper by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n4/full/nn1864.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thierry et al<\/a>, provided in the helpful answer by @Christiaan, shows how to apply this type of blocking approach to EEG measurements during presentation of visual stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p>The methods in that paper by Thierry et al also indicate the type of practical care that is used in professional analyses of this sort. The authors go into detail about the nature and placement of the electrodes, choice of which electrodes to use for analysis, signal-sampling rates, and so on. For example:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scalp activity was digitized at a 1-kHz sampling rate from 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes distributed throughout the scalp according to the 10\u201320 convention using Cz as a reference. Impedances were kept below 7 kOhms. The electroencephalogram was filtered on-line between 0.01 and 200 Hz and off-line low pass at 35 Hz using a zero phase-shift digital filter. Eye blink artifacts were mathematically corrected, and signals exceeding $\\pm$ 75 $\\mu$V in any given epoch were automatically discarded. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading papers like this are probably the best way to learn about what's involved and to find people who can teach you how to do it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":45062,"question_id":44975,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1460238539},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4d0917cf3785fd7bc9e95abeb1bcd1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11581,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11581/smeeb","reputation":43,"display_name":"smeeb","accept_rate":92},"score":1,"post_id":45067,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460234372,"comment_id":78718,"body":"As always, thanks again @Christiaan!

If they able to \"feed\" 300 million sperm cells, they probably will be able to feed a child.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36298,"question_id":36292,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1437576904},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNlya.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9124,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9124/alex","reputation":404,"display_name":"Alex","accept_rate":50},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ygbs5.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16897,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16897/voldemort","reputation":195,"display_name":"Voldemort","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":36319,"edited":false,"creation_date":1437682463,"comment_id":60271,"body":"If a male mates with the female, and then comes another male, wouldn&#39;t the first male be much more likely to succeed because he introduced the sperm beforehand?

These\n  investigators found that giving a male vasopressin causes it to stay\n  with its mate, whereas blocking this hormone prevents a pair-bond from\n  forming. The scientists saw similar effects in female prairie voles,\n  with oxytocin determining the extent of pair-bonding. In contrast, the\n  administration of these substances had no influence on social\n  interactions in the promiscuous montane voles. Surprisingly,\n  vasopressin and oxytocin are naturally found at similar levels in both\n  prairie and montane voles.[5]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/Libraries/images/200332193024_307.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Source:<\/p>\n\n<p>[1]. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22107910\">The role of oxytocin in mating and pregnancy<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[2]. <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Relationships/Hormones#Oxytocin\">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Relationships/Hormones#Oxytocin<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[3]. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9949283\">The role of oxytocin in relation to female sexual arousal.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[4] Grewen, K.M., Girdler, S.S., Amico, J., Light, K.C., 2005.

Also, in the form of clouds, atmospheric water can have a cooling effect on earth temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clouds illustrate why water vapor, unlike carbon dioxide and methane, is not thought of as a driver of recent changes in earth temperature but rather is more of a follower. Unlike those other two gases, if you keep trying to put water vapor gas into the atmosphere it will convert to liquid water at some point, leaving only a constant level of water in the form of gas. That's what happens when a cloud forms; what you see and what can shield you from the sun is a collection of water droplets or ice crystals. Large amounts of water vapor are also regularly put into the atmosphere by evaporation of water from the earth's surface, dwarfing the contribution from human respiration. Eventually the atmosphere gets locally saturated with water vapor and it falls back to earth as rain or snow in the hydrologic cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>In principle methane and carbon dioxide could similarly condense out of the gas phase, but not at temperatures that occur in our atmosphere. You need to go far out into cold reaches of the Solar System to find naturally occurring methane lakes or solid carbon dioxide. There is no equivalent of rain to remove excess of those gases from our atmosphere. Carbon dioxide can dissolve in water to leave the atmosphere, but at the cost of acidifying the water. Ocean acidification is another serious result of adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.<\/p>\n\n<p>The amount of vapor you can add before conversion to liquid water increases with the temperature. So as land temperature increases the rate of evaporation of water into the atmosphere can increase, and as atmospheric temperatures increases the amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can hold also increases. So in principle water vapor might thus serve to amplify the greenhouse warming from other gases, although its transition to liquid or ice in the atmosphere might tend to counteract that. This is a major issue being investigated in attempts to understand the interplay of factors that determine earth temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>A focus on carbon dioxide has an important practical aspect. If you control the excess release of carbon dioxide due to fuel combustion, you necessarily also control the associated excess release of water vapor.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, human activity ends up having much less direct influence on changes in atmospheric water vapor than it does on changes in carbon dioxide or methane.

I cannot comment on the reliability of the answer, but hopefully someone will have the expertise to do so:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One, our galaxy has a chiral spin and a magnetic orientation, which causes cosmic dust particles to polarize starlight as circularly polarized in one direction only. This circularly polarized light degrades D enantiomers of amino acids more than L enantiomers, and this effect is clear when analyzing the amino acids found on comets and meteors. This explains why, at least in the milky way, L enantiomers are preferred.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Two, although gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong nuclear force are achiral, the weak nuclear force (radioactive decay) is chiral. During beta decay, the emitted electrons preferentially favor one kind of spin. That's right, the parity of the universe is not conserved in nuclear decay. These chiral electrons once again preferrentially degrade D amino acids vs. L amino acids.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Thus due to the chirality of sunlight and the chirality of nuclear radiation, L amino acids are the more stable enantiomers and therefore are favored for abiogenesis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123615\" rel=\"nofollow\">BIOSYNTHESIS OF NONRIBOSOMAL PEPTIDES<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/t746466251668633/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reasons for the occurrence of the twenty coded protein amino acids<\/a> <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/12/7/4745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molecular Basis for Chiral Selection in RNA Aminoacylation<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8749373\" rel=\"nofollow\">How nature deals with stereoisomers<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4669121\" rel=\"nofollow\">The adaptation of diastereomeric S-prolyl dipeptide derivatives to the quantitative estimation of R- and S-leucine enantiomers.

This is a very deep and thorough answer, wich takes well into account the side of computational complexity (and computing machines theory). From a theoretic point of view, the Systems Theory shows that, no matter the complexity of a system, and no matter if the system itself is or is not digital (based on binary logic or analogic), it is always possible to translate it into a digital system, with a defined level of accuracy (overall quantization noise). The big issue in real world is to define and measure the state vector of a real brain, and even more difficult to define the component values of the state vector at time 0 (the concept itself of initial time is hard to define in this case). Under this point of view, the details of the biological structures and of the neural processes running in the bain, do not change the substance of the problem, only its complexity. To solve somehow the big issue of defining the state vector of the brain one day, would mean to have defined an acceptable logical schema of the wole brain. To approach that outcome a way bigger effort should be made in the direction of cathegorizing the different structures and processes of the brain into the blocks of a logical system comparable to a computer program, or if we prefer, to a finite state probabilistic digital machine, in which each block should embody a single structure or process of the brain.

Does it mean \"O2 released from the oceans into the atmosphere, where it contributes to a growing surplus\"? That can't be the case since the amount of O2 in the atmosphere is pretty constant, and there is evidence that it is significantly lower than in Jurassic times.  Overall the global O2 sinks must balance the O2 sources, or if anything must slightly exceed them, resulting in the current gradually increasing atmospheric CO2 levels at the expense of O2 levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>So by \"released\" we have to just mean \"released by the process of photosynthesis, at the point of its operation\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Oceans fix 80% of the total CO2 fixed by photosynthesis, yes, but they also unfix it at a similar rate. For every algal cell that's photosynthesising, there's one that's dead or dying and being consumed by bacteria (which consume O2), or that's consuming oxygen itself in order to keep its metabolic processes operating at night. So the NET amount of O2 released by the oceans is something close to zero.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now we have to ask what we mean by \"productivity\" in this context. If a molecule of CO2 gets fixed due to algal activity but then almost immediately gets unfixed again, does that count as \"productivity\"? But, blink and you'd miss it! Even if you don't blink, it's hardly likely to be measurable. The dry weight of the algae at the end of the of the process is the same as at the beginning. so if we define \"productivity\" as \"increase in dry weight of algae\" then the productivity is zero.<\/p>\n\n<p>For algal photosynthesis to have an enduring effect on global CO2 or O2 levels, the fixed CO2 has to become incorporated into something less fleeting than algae. Something like cod or hake, which as a bonus can be harvested and placed on tables. \"Productivity\" usually refers to the power of the oceans to replenish the stocks of these things post-harvest, and that is indeed low when compared to the ability of the land to produce repeated harvests.<\/p>\n\n<p>It would be a different story if we were to regard algae as potentially suitable for mass harvesting, so that their ability to grow like wildfire in the presence of fertilizer runoffs from the land was regarded as \"productivity\" rather than as a profound nuisance.

The lack of otters feeding on sea urchins causes an increase in their abundance, and this leads to an increased consumption of kelp by the sea urchins, which leads to the decrease in the density of kelp. Therefore, the sea otter is the keystone species since a change in their abundance has a significant impact onto the ecosystem and the organisms living in it. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":44777,"question_id":44746,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1459497369}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44746/based-on-this-diagram-how-do-you-deduce-the-keystone-species","last_activity_date":1460152462,"creation_date":1459387369,"answer_count":1,"title":"Based on this diagram, how do you deduce the keystone species?","body":"<p>How would you figure out what the keystone species is in the following textbook question?

Natural selection was never proposed to explain <em>all<\/em> evolution, nor how advantageous traits <em>arise<\/em>, but was proposed to explain how advantageous traits spread. Ultimately, why adaptation is so prevalent?<\/p>\n\n<p>The modern theory of <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_14\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolution<\/a> is so much more than a theory of evolution by natural selection. It can explain perfectly well how all variation has come in to being. Its mechanisms of mutation, migration, drift, and selection can both erode and generate new genetic variation. New genetic variation, and the phenotypic changes that brings, occurs by <em>mutation<\/em>. Various <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/mutations_03\" rel=\"nofollow\">types of mutation<\/a> can occur. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutations are random in their <em>effect<\/em>.<\/strong> Now it is possible that mutation <em>rates<\/em> are <em>not<\/em> random; if you imagine two theoretical species which have both gone through genetic bottlenecks, such that they both have little genetic variation, then the species with a higher mutation rate <em>might<\/em> have a better chance of staving off extinction because mutation will increase genetic variation, and genetic variation limits the rate of adaptation. Therefore, if there is a genetically coded trait which increases mutation rates then it may spread. Conversely, mutation is generally detrimental (see Fisher's Geometric Model) so, in general, there will also be selection for lower rates of mutation. From what I can gather on Wagner's theory on <em>innovation<\/em> is that mutation may be some kind of premeditated, directed mechanism with the organism trying to make a certain trait evolve.

The accuracy and completeness goes down fairly quickly as you go back in time but thousands of years to hundreds of thousands of years is roughly possible.

If gene A is nearly identical in every individual in a population, but gene B has thousands of pretty distinct variations, it's clear gene A does something important and has been powerfully selected for.

The loss of genetic diversity at linked loci occurs by a process called a <em>selective sweep<\/em>.

Genetic diversity will be lost from the linked loci at a rate determined by the strength of selection and the degree of linkage (where tighter linkage and stronger selection increase the rate of loss). <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692205/pdf/9533122.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper<\/a> (see section 7 for selective sweeps) provides a good discussion of the factors affecting genetic variation in natural populations, and draws on the example of the <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43460/is-complete-genetic-linkage-possible/43462#43462\">Y chromosome<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One or more selective sweeps will have left the Y chromosome\n  with little or no variability<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Inference of ancestral populations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You could sample DNA of the population at the time you are interested in.

DNA degrades over time therefore it is important to have an understanding of <em>how<\/em> DNA degrades over time if you want to infer about the population. <em>(I saw a talk a while back by a researcher, can't remember the name, taking samples from graves.

It's often difficult to find sources of DNA samples which <em>a)<\/em> of high enough quality and <em>b)<\/em> with enough individuals to allow good inference of the ancestral population; a small sample will be prone to sampling bias.<sup>*<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>There is another approach, and its commonly used now. If you are interested in finding more you should be searching for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">coalescent theory and methods<\/a>. This infers back, based on current (or relatively more recent) genetic composition of populations and using population genetic theory. It's not really an used as an attempt to estimate the <em>specific allele frequency<\/em>, rather as an attempt to <a href=\"http://www.sfu.ca/biology/courses/bisc869/869_lectures/MHP_Coalescent.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">infer population size, migration rates, and recombination rates.<\/a> It infers when was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent common ancestor<\/a> (MRCA). <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790309002164\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper reviews<\/a> coalescent methods for phylogenetic trees and this is an <a href=\"http://www.sfu.ca/biology/courses/bisc869/869_lectures/MHP_Coalescent.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction lecture on coalescence<\/a>. Coalescent theory has many considerations that need to be made; Are some mutations more common than others (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molecular Clock<\/a>)? How does selection affect genetic variation (e.g. selective sweeps)? Does linkage vary across the genome? Do rates of mutation, drift, and selection vary across the genome? Are different parts of the genome differently affected by migration?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Both approaches raise serious considerations which are at the forefront of evolutionary genetics right now.<\/strong> Research groups all over the world are developing lab methods, statistical methods, and mathematical models in an attempt to make inference more accurate. Right now the only way, in my opinion, to infer the frequency of <em>specific alleles<\/em> in ancestral populations is to use ancient DNA methods; coalescent can be used to infer population genetic parameters, but regarding specific alleles it just has so many factors to consider which (right now, but certainly less so in the future) we just don't have a thorough understanding of. In other words, the assumptions that need to be made for coalescence to be able to estimate specific ancestral allele frequencies are rarely going to be satisfied. However, as long as this is properly discussed there is no problem with the method being used, and I am certain that the future is bright for such methods.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*On sampling bias: Imagine you want to work out the frequency of the number two on a six-sided die (we know the true frequency is 0.167). You roll the die four times and the die shows the side with two dots once. You population frequency estimate is 0.25. Your friend rolls the same die <em>4000<\/em> times. They see the two dots 652 times, which is 0.163, much more representative of the true population frequency.

What happened just after the impact was that a sizable fraction of the entire volume involved on the collision would be on ballistic trajectories. Most of these would fall back to Earth, while a small fraction would escape Earth's gravity. Now, these ejecta actually contain a significant fraction of the total energy of the impact and almost all of that in then dissipated as heat when they re-enter the atmosphere.

Thanks"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1429111225,"creation_date":1429111225,"body":"<p>First of all, there is a very heated debate about this in the field of social evolution at present, and you aren't likely to get a conclusive answer. One theorist may give you one answer, but another will vehemently disagree. I'll start by logically answering your questions in reverse order!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2:<\/strong> <em>Can you please provide an intuitive explanation of why kin- and group-selection are the same thing?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The first formal 'proof' that they are the same came from a paper by <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462497?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Queller<\/a> in 1992. Let me give you the gist of what he found without being ultra rigorous. I won't focus on relatedness, since that was answered nicely by @falsum, \"Price's equation tells us that this happens when the genetic variance between-groups is higher than the genetic variance within-groups. This is equivalent to saying that altruists tend to interact with other altruists and, accordingly, that the coefficient of relatedness increases.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Queller explored the change in mean additive genetic (breeding) value for a trait over a single generation using Price's equation <\/p>\n\n<p>$\n\\Delta \\bar{G} = \\mathrm{Cov}(W,G)\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $G$ is the additive genetic value, and $W$ is relative fitness. Now, the key question is, how should we define fitness? If we treat it as a random variable, we can do a linear regression of fitness on a set of explanatory variables. What should we choose for the explanatory variables? One natural choice might be to predict the fitness of a focal individual based on the phenotype of the focal individual itself, <em>and<\/em> the phenotype of the individuals the individual interacts with socially:<\/p>\n\n<p>$\nW_{i} = w_{0} + \\beta_{direct} P_{i} + \\beta_{social} P_{j}\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $w_{0}$ is baseline fitness, $P_{i}$ is the phenotype of the focal individual, and $P_{j}$ is the phenotype of the focal individual's social partner. However, another way to predict the fitness of a focal individual might be to focus on the average phenotype of individuals in the focal individual's group, and the deviation of the focal individual's phenotype from the mean phenotype of individuals in the group<\/p>\n\n<p>$\nW_{i} = w_{0} + \\beta_{deviation} (\\bar{P}_{group} - P_{i}) + \\beta_{group} \\bar{P}_{group}\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>These regression equations for fitness hold exactly (only for a single generation), independent of the 'true' form of the fitness functions (they can be as non-linear as you like). What these allow us to do, however, is partition fitness effects into those that are due to benefits of a behaviour, those that are due to costs of a behaviour (and unmodelled residuals or 'noise'). <\/p>\n\n<p>From a kin-selection perspective, it turns out that the benefit in Hamilton's rule is<\/p>\n\n<p>$\n\\beta_{social} = B\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>and the cost in Hamilton's rule is<\/p>\n\n<p>$\n\\beta_{direct} = C\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>From a group-selection perspective, it turns out that the benefits and costs in Hamilton's rule are distributed over deivation and group effects<\/p>\n\n<p>$\n\\beta_{deviation} = C - B\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n<p>$\n\\beta_{group} = C + (N-1)B\n$<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, we find that it possible to write fitness equivalently in two different ways that relate the change in frequency of individuals to benefits and costs associated with a social phenotype. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1<\/strong> <em>Is group selection equivalent to kin selection for any evolutionary game or exclusively for the prisoner's dilemna?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>They are always equivalent no matter what game is being played or how the population is structured <em>if<\/em> you are happy use the regression methods described to define fitness, benefits, costs, and relatedness. Many people have issues with the regression methods though. See <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/50/20135.abstract\">Allen et al<\/a> for a discussion of this. Others argue that kin-selection holds in every case and that the problems with kin-selection stem from a misunderstanding of the methodology. See <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02236.x/pdf\">Gardner et al<\/a> for a discussion of this. <\/p>\n\n<p>Many biologists find the debates in social evolution about kin/multi-level selection unhelpful (at best), and choose either framework to work in based on the question at hand. A few are very partisan on either side. There is a great deal of misrepresentation floating around about both, so read papers making strong claims with skepticism and caution.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":31378,"question_id":19692,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2240fd34b086b0c1c8d22aad19974030?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":23053,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/23053/charles-goodnight","reputation":21,"display_name":"Charles Goodnight"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":45012,"edited":false,"creation_date":1460057586,"comment_id":78594,"body":"Welcome to Bio and thanks for your great answer.

It then combines each of these component/partial solutions to solve the original equation. In laymen's terms, it's like taking a smoothie, and breaking it down into its recipe of ingredients.

It can certainly be a factor but usually dominance is mostly known to arise because of a slight difference in function (or in other words activity) of the gene product (which may be a protein or an RNA). <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that a change of function doesn't mean the alleles would have a totally different function. It just means that the alleles can be different in the way they function. For example two variants of an enzyme may have slightly different kinetic properties (such as V<sub>max<\/sub> K<sub>m<\/sub> and k<sub>cat<\/sub>). While change of activity may generally refer to V<sub>max<\/sub> (maximum enzyme activity), mutations can also change the other constants. Some mutations can make the enzyme sensitive to temperature by affecting the stability of the overall structure. The extreme would be a functional allele and a non-functional allele. <\/p>\n\n<p>While concentration of the product does affect its activity, it does not change its specific activity, which may change in the presence of a mutation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, even if one allele is actually has a higher expression than the other, the resultant trait can be differentiated from that of the <code>aa<\/code> homozygote only if the two alleles have slightly different functions or if the difference in expression level between of the gene product in <code>Aa<\/code> and <code>aa<\/code> is great enough to elicit different biological effects. In the second case there would be no change in the gene function and the effect of <strong>dominance<\/strong> is purely based on <strong>gene dosage<\/strong>. This review by <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/path.2623\" rel=\"nofollow\">Veitia and Birchler (2010)<\/a> explores the possibility of <em>stoichiometric alterations of macromolecular complexes or cellular networks<\/em> being <em>responsible for dominant phenotypes<\/em>*.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Now, how can a mutation lead to a difference in expression level without changing the activity of the product?<\/h3>\n\n<p>There are three cases here:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The mutation is in the expressed region (exonic) but doesn't lead to change in activity (for e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonymous_substitution\" rel=\"nofollow\">synonymous mutations<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>The mutation is in the transcribed region but in the intron.<\/li>\n<li>The mutation is in the non-transcribed DNA regions such as promoter/enhancer etc. <em>Exceptions:<\/em> certain <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/38784/3340\">downstream promoter elements<\/a> are actually transcribed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Only mutations in the promoters/enhancers can affect transcription by affecting the recruitment of RNA-polymerase. However, you should note that mutations in the non-transcribed regions, especially in the distal regulatory elements are not considered a part of the gene in consideration. Since, such complex modes of regulation were unknown during the time of Mendel, the classical genetics does not explain these effects. Hence, these mutants would not be called alleles of the considered gene. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations in the transcribed regions may affect the elongation rate of polymerase (especially if it leads to formation of stable DNA secondary structures). <strong>This is just a theoretical possibility<\/strong> and I <strong>have not<\/strong> come across any study that reported has reported something like this. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, mutations in the untranslated regions of the mRNA can change the expression of the protein.

Similarly, a gram-force is 9.80665 mN, and a milligram-force is 9.80665 µN. \nKilogram-force is a non-standard unit and does not comply with the SI Metric System.\nSee:\n<a href=\"http://www.sengpielaudio.com/ConvForce.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sengpielaudio.com/ConvForce.htm<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":41356,"question_id":20276,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20276/relationship-between-mn-and-mg-in-vessel-contraction-studies","last_activity_date":1459996516,"creation_date":1407334191,"answer_count":1,"title":"Relationship between mN and mg in vessel contraction studies?","body":"<p>What is the relationship between <strong>mN<\/strong> and <strong>mg<\/strong> as the units involved to measure the changes in contraction?

It's important in the field of genomics and useful in transcriptomics and proteomics.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's best to extract DNA as soon as the sample has been removed from the living organism since all kinds of physiological processes start breaking down DNA in dead tissue.

Biological repeats refer to, for example, taking three strands of your hair for analysis, while technical repeats refer to, for example, carrying out three PCR experiments on material from the same strand of hair. Once you've used tissue to extract DNA you don't keep remaining tissue because it gets contaminated during experimental preparation. That is why you may want to have biological repeats. It's also important to take precaution when removing the sample from the organism. This means wearing latex gloves and even using dilute ethanol to sterilize the sample before placing it in a sterile container. The problem is that ethanol can interfere with DNA extraction and be a contaminant itself.

If the accumulated probability of detection across all habitat types is high (approaching 1, given that the animal is present), then the detection probability shouldn't be a problem for the binary occurrence variable. An indication of this would be if you have sites (cameras) with either zero or a very high number of occurrences, which should indicate that the binary occurrence is rather robust. On the other hand, if sites have 0-4 occurrences in total it will be extremely difficult to separate non-occurrence from random factors or detectability. I assume that the detection probability across habitats is unknown though (as well as the accumulated probability of detection), but you might be able to make an educated guess. Also, by using a binary response, you will completely exclude the possibility to estimate e.g. an effect of habitat quality (for instance a difference in abundance between habitats), since counts of 1 or 13 will both be represented by 1 in the binary detection variable. In the Q, you talk about \"<em>modeling relative suitability<\/em>\" which indicates that you are indeed interested in something similar to this (relative habitat quality). In that case, I think that a binary response will be too coarse to provide useful information.<\/p>\n\n<p>One possible toy scenario could be that you have two habitat types A and B (10 camera locations/sites of each) with a binary detection variable as:<\/p>\n\n<p>A: 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1  (species found in 7 sites)<br>\nB: 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0  (species found in 4 sites)<\/p>\n\n<p>In that case, the species can obviously exist in both habitat types (as you have categorized them), so the higher amount if zeros in B can represent (among other things) 1) lower occupancy of this habitat (in a metapop perspective), 2) that the quality of B is heterogeneous which is not captured by your habitat categorization (so parts of B is just as suitable as A), 3) lower population abundance in B compared to A (but the same detectability), or 4) lower detectability in B compared to A (but the same abundance). I don't really see how you can separate between these cases with only the binary variable, and I don't believe that using a binary detection variable will solve any specific problems compared to using the count data.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is all very hand-wavy, but can hopefully give you some useful ideas/perspectives.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44942,"question_id":44819,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1459949120}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44819/different-effects-of-detection-probability-between-presence-and-count-data-at-th","last_activity_date":1459949120,"creation_date":1459623191,"answer_count":2,"title":"Different Effects of Detection Probability Between Presence and Count Data at the Same Location","body":"<p>I'm modeling habitat suitability for a large, mobile animal using occurrence data (presence only - I have no true absence data in this case) collected from camera traps (stations with automatic motion/heat sensing cameras). At each camera trap location I have 0 to several occurrences recorded.<\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, when such data is modeled, they are modeled as count data, and detection probability is included in order to mitigate for covariates that affect detection, which otherwise may be identified as covariates that affect suitability. For example, an area where detection is less likely due to, say, dense vegetation, may be mistaken as less suitable due to that vegetation structure when in fact that may not be the case (or even the opposite may be true).<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is, if the count variable were to instead be used as a detection/no-detection variable (so, a binary) would the probability of detection have less of an effect on the model (*when modeling relative suitability, not probability of occurrence)? i.e. if you didn't account detection probability, would using a binary response variable give you a less biased estimate of habitat suitability than if you were to use count data?

Ionizing radiation can cause <strong>chemical changes<\/strong> by <strong>breaking chemical bonds<\/strong> and <strong>damage living tissues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shorter wavelength UV begins to have enough energy to break chemical bonds. X-ray and gamma ray radiation, which are at the upper end of the EM spectrum, have high frequencies (~100 billion billion hertz). Radiation in this range has high energy and it can <strong>strip electrons from an atom<\/strong> or even <strong>break up the nucleus of the atom<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The process in which an electron is given enough energy to break away from an atom is called ionization. It results in the formation of two ions: the molecule with a net positive charge, and the free electron with a negative charge. Each ionization releases a <strong>large amount of energy<\/strong> which is <strong>absorbed by the surrounding tissues<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are three main kinds of ionizing radiation:<\/p>\n\n<p>Alpha particles, which include two protons and two neutrons; beta particles, which are essentially electrons; and gamma rays and x-rays are photons.
