A \"genetic test\" is just simply a test that tells you whether or not you have a certain genotype. Yes, it is often times used to tell if a person has a disease or not, but that doesnt always have to be the case. I may just want to know, for example, if a mouse I have carriers a certain transgene. The reason why genetic tests are good at determining if someone has a disease is because many diseases are simple, or at least have a well-defined genotype. Sure, you can make a genetic test for a complex disease like obesity if you want, but no one does this because as you pointed out in your question there are sometimes more than one gene involved, so a genetic test for that would not be very good.<\/p>\n\n<p>But for genetic tests of diseases of a known genotype, they are very accurate. Of course you have some false positives and false negatives. Look up the terms selectivity and sensitivity. If you have a sensitive test you will catch a lot of people with the disease but also many false positives. If you have a selective test you will not have many false positives but you may miss people who actually have the disease. Its a trade-off. Testing someone twice will clear things up usually.<\/p>\n\n<p>And then there are cases where you have a disease with a known genotype but still have an inaccurate genetic test on rare occasions. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716110\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heres a paper about a disease known as Spinal Muscular Atrophy<\/a>. There is a genetic test that works 95% of the time but sometimes it does not match up with the phenotype. In the paper they find a mutation that explains why the genetic test does not match the phenotype. Two things are interesting about the paper. One, the genetic test is not wrong, its just that the phenotype is not what you'd expect. And two, not all people who have a discordant genetic test have this mutation. So whats going on in these patients and why their test doesnt match their phenotype is anyone's guess.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first point is especially important so I will repeat it. The genetic test was not wrong, the phenotype just did not match it as expected.

Often times there isn't just one gene, but rather many genes playing a role (these are called polygenic traits).  For example, see my <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/9948/4101\">answer to a question on hair color<\/a>; there are dozens of simple changes that can affect the color of hair and eyes.  These complex traits are really hard to tease out!<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, not everything is 100% from genes; the environment can also play a <em>huge<\/em> role.  Often we talk about how heritable a gene or a trait is by giving a percent, meaning how much of is due to genes you inherit from your parents.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">heritability of IQ<\/a> is an interesting read for an introduction to the concept.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what is the use of the genetic tests?  Well, for starters, ancestry is really interesting and useful for people.  Not just paternity or maternity (which is obviously accurate and widespread) but knowing where you are from.  <a href=\"http://refer.23andme.com/a/clk/1CBc1K\" rel=\"nofollow\">23andMe<\/a> is a great service (I'm 2.9% Neanderthal!) for finding out where you came from genetically.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are, additionally, a number of traits that we've studied, or that do have strong genetic factors.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sickle-cell disease<\/a> is a classic example of something just from your genotype, whereas other things are less determinate; for example, the heritability of baldness is around 81%, and I know from my genome that I have a slightly lower chance of becoming bald.  There are other, more serious health risks that people would want to be tested for (BRCA for breast cancer, LRRK2 for Parkinson's, APOE for Alzheimer's) as well as inherited traits that are very genetically determined (like sickle-cell or Tay-Sachs).<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, the genetic tests are very good at determining what the genotype is, which can be very useful for certain traits but completely useless for others.

There are many ways to interpret that word!<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this doesn't totally suck any romantic ideas out of you, but metaphysical concepts of love and romantic ideas of love are not always relevant when you talk about biology.  A case for the universal human family and world peace can be made. <\/p>\n\n<p>In evolutionary biology love usually has a different meaning than most people mean, but maybe one similar to what you refer to here; Love is often considered to be the bond with one's offspring to help ensure that they succeed and reproduce.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This idea is most often expressed in terms of \"kin selection\".  A theory that an individual is helpful to your reproductive success if they carry genes similar to you.  In particular ant colonies may be entirely built around the solidarity of the family unit: all the workers are birthed from the queen and they themselves do not reproduce, but they do work together because, to put it plainly, helping the hive is helping themselves reproduce. <\/p>\n\n<p>The biologist Sarah Hrdy has written an excellent book that looks at the biological origins and variety of ways that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Blaffer_Hrdy#Mother_Nature\">motherhood creates social and emotional relationships, which is not entirely a human idea of motherhood<\/a>, but biological and mind expanding for the evolutionary take.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the idea that only close relatives should be loved is not quite right. Even intuitively we see adults adopting children distinctly unlike them in appearance, people devoting their lives to the general good, etc etc. Biology cannot pretend that this sort of behavior doesn't exist - it can only try to explain it within the framework of what we understand. <\/p>\n\n<p>Its well understood that cooperation and social cohesion are also the result of evolutionary forces.  The primary reference for this is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma\">iterated Prisoner's Dilemma<\/a> experiment; in systems where individuals are interacting over and over again, helping others creates a system of cooperation where reciprocity where everyone benefits because the payoffs are stability, security, safety etc.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Again this might not sound like 'love', but in human social, cooperative situations it can be professed as love. Love of country, profession, causes etc if you will. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is a big debate about whether <em>altruism<\/em> exists: many biologists believe that an extended from of kin selection is in play - that we're all one sort of human family.  This is essentially an argument that all our energies are self interested on some level - we're just trying to further the interests of the human race because it will help our own offspring do well. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think it might go further than that - we also care for non human and even ugly very distant forms of life if you look at some people's lives.  One can argue that the realization that caring about the ecosystem is self-interest and not altruistic.  The distance at which this extends kin selection is pretty far, but anyway the argument goes on. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Points: Lots of human interests like science, are a sort of love? They don't seem to help reproduction.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty deep point, really.  I'd say it can help to understand question to start with uncles and grandmothers.  Lots of animals do not reproduce, and this is considered okay by kin selection.  Take a look at wolf packs.  The alpha male is the only animal to mate, the other males seem to be hanging out.  First of all the wolves may be closely related, so the avuncular role of taking care of cousins and nephew/nieces is one kin selection argument.  But even if they weren't, there is the fact that pack structure is not biologically altruistic; the other males and females who do not mate may still do so in the future.  In the meantime, the pack cooperation creates a more secure condition where offspring can have a better chance of success.  Lots of creative, cultural, scientific work is similar as far as I can see.  We can adopt non-reproductive pursuits and still feel that we are doing something worthwhile.  I guess the same can be said for adoption, social causes, religion and just about anything else people do which is not having children. <\/p>\n\n<p>How can this be a selective advantage - included by evolution into the human instinct?  I'd cite the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis#The_grandmother_effect\">grandmother effect<\/a> here.  There is some evidence to support the idea that women live longer after menopause because it creates more successful grandchildren.  While this is not a direct effect, any mutation that extends the caregiving instinct would be sustained in the gene pool.  Its possible that if such a caregiving instinct of uncles and grandmothers were to extend to other people, even beyond the family, that it would be sustained in the gene pool.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed being smart and or rich usually doesn't increase the <em>number<\/em> of children humans have.  In fact the opposite is the case for both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate#Developed_or_developing_countries\">statistical<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/07/smart-women-not-having-kids\">anecdotal<\/a> evidence.  Few would say that this is a bad thing.  Human being are getting a better deal when they spend energy on better quality offspring, not quantity.  You can look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\">r/K selection theory<\/a> for a better understanding of this argument, but some animals have chosen cheap offspring and many of them - think cockroach or guppy.  These animals would rather eat their offspring than try to feed it.  Humans, more than nearly any other animal i believe, spend their lives caring for helpless offspring until they are ready for life.  Modern life has only extended this from a few years to nearly 20 years.  But it certainly works - the only animal that can compete with human beings is other human beings. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hope that makes sense.  There's some speculating here, but its hard to dispute that people devote their time and energy to all sorts of things besides mating.  In the end biology has to accommodate such behavior.  Biological theories we call laws don't change the behavior of living things;  its always the other way around. <\/p>\n","answer_id":10817,"question_id":10816,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1381685496},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1375440688/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":4139,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4139/johntreml","reputation":536,"display_name":"johntreml"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1381501838,"creation_date":1381501838,"body":"<p>Shigeta brings up the question of altruism which Richard Dawkins famously explains in the context of evolution in The Selfish Gene.

Because of the massive diversity amongst those pathogens, no one single MHC allele will allow the best response.  For example, the delta-32 deletion that bears resistance to HIV also increases susceptibility to West Nile; if you're more likely to suffer from the latter, that is a fitness reduction that could be selected against.

If everyone has similar alleles one virus could wipe everyone out; we observe something similar happen with our crops, for example, when grown in massive monocultures.  There is also a fair amount of evidence, mainly in humans and mice I believe, supporting a role for MHC in mate selection.

For example, a paper from 2003<sup><a href=\"http://iai.asm.org/content/71/4/2079.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a><\/sup> points out that in an immunological response, only a few peptides dominate the response; there may be no real advantage to having extra ones if they are unused, and having those others around might dilute the useful response (That paper also takes an interesting view of serial infections, and shows that heterozygotes are indeed <em>advantaged<\/em> during coinfection).

The speaker presented 5 questions which, if you answer yes to, you can only come to the conclusion that evolution exists. Firstly though we should define evolution: Evolution is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. <\/p>\n\n<p>It was one of the best arguments I've seen put forward so I'll try to recreate it here. Put this to them and see what they say - and just in case they say no to any, I've put answers in for you ;) There is no hard evidence for the first four points because they are so damn obvious that if people say no, even after a logic based argument, then all they will ever say is no, they shouldn't need a scientific paper.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>1) Do individuals reproduce?<\/em><\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The answer to this is undeniably yes, you were the result of reproduction. Reproduction exists.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>2) Is there variation among individuals?<\/em><\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, again this is undeniable. Do we all look and act the same? No. Are some people taller than others? Yes. Some more physically fit than others? Yes. Is everyone's hair or eye color the same? No. See, undeniable. Variation exists. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>3) Do some individuals die before they get to reproduce?<\/em><\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously yes. Children unfortunately die (of natural causes) which means they do no get to reproduce. Just go look in a cemetery or open the obituaries page of you newspaper and you'll likely find some one who died before they could have reproduced. Some people also never reproduce, because of life choices or fertility problems. Variance in reproductive success exists.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>4) Do offspring resemble parents?<\/em><\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>The answer to this is also yes, when two humans reproduce they (normally) produce something that resembles a human. And when that human reaches maturity they will likely look a more like their parents than a random stranger. Personally I was looking at old family photos recently and I honestly though I had found a picture of me marrying my mother, that's how similar my dad and I look. Heritability of variance exists.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>5) Does heritable variation lead to differences in reproductive success?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If you've answered yes to all of the above then you really should be answering yes to this one too. As a hypothetical illustrative scenario, imagine two male deer. One has big antlers and one has small antlers. The size of antlers is largely genetically determined. The male with big antlers is seen as more attractive by a female. She chooses to mate with him. She gives birth to his offspring (n=2, 1 male 1 female) who inherit his genes for large antlers. This repeats with several females in the population (n=10). The smaller male has fewer mating events (n=2) and therefore sires fewer males in the next generation. The next generation contains more males with large antlers (n=10) than small antlers (n=2). This is evolution, the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another example is humans. We know <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/mens-sexual-health/male-infertility-22754.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">some men have low sperm counts leading to low probability of successful mating<\/a>. Further, we know that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103481\" rel=\"nofollow\">male infertility can be genetically<\/a> caused for example by Y-linked genetic defects. Therefore we can expect that males with low sperm counts, caused by Y-linked defects, will have fewer offspring than a healthy male (given equal opportunity to mate) and because all males inherit their fathers Y chromosome they too will have low sperm counts. They will be represented at a lower level in the population's next generation. Again, this is evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Speciation:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It then doesn't take much to jump from this to speciation. It involves the introduction of isolating mechanisms. These can be things like geography (allopatric speciation), or sympatric mechanisms like morphology, behavior, or any trait which prevents one group of individuals mating with another. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'll illustrate first, and take the more difficult type - sympatric speciation. Again imagine our deer population. This time there is variance in sperm morphology, and female reproductive tracts. Males can produce two different types of sperm, one (male type S) is a slow moving but more resistant to the hostile female reproductive tract (because it is resistant to all types of antibody the females can produce), the other is faster (male type F) but less resistant (because it is resistant to only some of antibody the females can produce). Female reproductive tracts vary in the number of different antibodies they produce, one produces \"all\" that can be produced (female type R) and the other only a subset of the full array (female type W).<\/p>\n\n<p>What will happen is that type S males will be more successful when mating with type R females because their sperm survive (whereas type F males have no sperm fertilizing the egg). However, type F males will be more successful in sperm competition than type S when mating to type W females. Repeated over many generations, these incompatibilities will cause distinct mating groups which do not overlap, i.e. species.<\/p>\n\n<p>In reality it is much simpler to demonstrate this with allopatric speciation. Here two groups of one species become isolated by a geographical feature, like a river. Over time these populations evolve differently (because genetic mutation is random and selection might differ on opposite sides of the river).

Originally the predominant color was white, which camouflaged them against light-coloured trees such as <em>Betula<\/em> plants, while dark-colored moths were rare.

Here is a good definition from wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In biology, a ring species is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can interbreed with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two \"end\" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential gene flow between each \"linked\" species. Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, \"end\" populations may co-exist in the same region thus closing a \"ring\".<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Ring species provide important evidence of evolution in that they illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, and are special because they represent in living populations what normally happens over time between long deceased ancestor populations and living populations, in which the intermediates have become extinct. Richard Dawkins observes that ring species \"are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You can continue the reading at the related <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia article<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":10660,"question_id":10656,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1380616198},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934a90404fe944a01135142de991d393?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4199,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4199/von-mises","reputation":746,"display_name":"von Mises"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1380642900,"creation_date":1380642900,"body":"<p>Of course you dont see a transition species at present!

When we divide things up into discreet species it makes it seem all neat and tidy but really it is not because of the large amount of variation that exists within a species.

The major function of the SNS is fight to flight response along with maintaining homeostasis in which case it internally will be alert maintaining body status from the background. <\/p>\n\n<p>Before sending any response to target tissue when there is input to SNS it has to secrete neurotransmitters but before this to the sympatho-adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the great secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>So whenever SNS senses (message flow is bidirectional) any stress it responds it in following action mentioned:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the synapses within the ganglia, preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons. In response to this stimulus postganglionic neurons - with two important exceptions - release norepinephrine, which activates adrenergic receptors on the peripheral target tissues. The activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the receptors receive the information then the response flows to the target tissue via neurons with the help of the neurotransmitters. To explain goosebumps technically:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Properly known as piloerection, horripliation or pilomotor reflex, the bumps we get are stimulated by fear and cold and they are essentially just a temporary change in the skin. These stimulants cause a nerve discharge from the sympathetic nervous system (which is an involuntary portion of nerves we have) and the nerve discharges create muscle contractions called arrrectores pilorum that raise the hair follicles in our skin. It is the elevation of the hair that causes the Goosebumps.  The name Goosebumps actually comes from the fact that plucked goose feathers resemble the human hair follicles.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMAu2.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Goosebumps also occur when we listen to surprise songs, sad songs or some other kind of thrilling music.

Perhaps more commonly, these techniques can be used to validate an artificially produced protein before approving it for therapy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, while we can know the sequence of amino acids in a protein very easily we don't necessarily know which ones are useful.  A region oriented toward the outside of a protein may partake in a biological function.  If a specific protein domain is imbedded inside the center of the protein, it is not very available for function, either by the protein or for other targets such as antibodies.  For example, one of the big projects in HIV research now is to get very good and very fine structure of viral proteins on the envelope of the virus; knowing which regions are readily accessible would make for potential good drug/cell/antibody targets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the structure itself can give some insight as to function.  Proteins may not have homology by amino acid sequence, but similarly-structured proteins can have similar functions.  People smarter than me can recognize those features and can learn quite a bit about a protein just from its shape.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's a fun little anecdote I conveniently just came upon.

From this you can see if the compound is able to enter the active site of the protein, the orientation it would be in, etc. Using a supercomputer you can do this with hundreds of compounds in a matter of hours.

Since biological processes are all fundamentally chemical ones.  The specific positions of the atoms reveal how proteins, nucleotides, lipids, drugs and other biological molecules specifically interact.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Protein structures broke the ground in biological inheritance (Watson / Crick / Franklin's DNA structure) <\/li>\n<li>Protein structures of lysozyme and proteases were the first to show exactly how proteins bind their substrates and enzymatically catalyze chemical reactions.  <\/li>\n<li>Protein structure of hemoglobin in both oxy- and deoxy- forms (i.e. with and without oxygen bound). showed that proteins change their spatial arrangement to modulate their function.  <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>This list goes on to more recent breakthroughs in how signals and molecules interact with the cell through the membrane.  There is literally no topic in cellular biology which has not substantially benefitted from having a protein structure revealed. <\/p>\n\n<p>The advantages of working with protein crystals are that they can be larger proteins and certain kinds of difference experiments an be more easily performed when a protein crystal is obtained.  For instance if you have a crystal of a 100 kDa (~900 amino acid) protein, you can often find the binding pocket of the enzyme without a tremendous amount of work. <\/p>\n\n<p>The disadvantage of working with protein crystals, as you probably know well is that getting crystals is often a quixotic effort soaking up months or years, often with little or no results.  Pretty demoralizing until you hit the target.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you're astounded to think that proteins, which are often hundreds or thousands of times larger than a salt or mineral you usually find in crystals...you are dead on.  The crystals are often very tiny - a decent sized crystal measures about a millimeter on one side, but often are only a fraction of that size.  That's why protein crystals often are taken to synchrotrons, linear accellerators or other free electron X-ray sources which are millions (?) of times more intense than a dental x-ray.

You should check your sequence and the cells you are going into to make sure you aren't getting Amber (UAG) suppression.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before you do anything, you should check your DNA of all your groups.  Run it uncut on a gel and make sure the majority of the DNA is super coil.  The next easiest thing to check is translation problems.

The prestige of riding a white horse has thus led to selection of the Gray-causing mutation by humans; this mutation is by far the most common cause of white color in horse.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This phenotype is actually often detrimental, as white/gray horses can have <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/28/rspb.2009.2202.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">eye problems and higher rates of skin cancer<\/a>; Camargue's are <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0749.2000.130109.x/pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">particularly susceptible to melanomas<\/a>, present in around 70% of horses by age 15.

It can be DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded, circular or linear. Animals, in turn, possess only double stranded DNA as their genetic material: linear dsDNA for the nuclear genome and [usually] circular dsDNA for the their mitochondrial genomes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>DNA termini pose a special problem for the maintenance of the molecule and show very unusual organization in terms of DNA sequence and structure. Repetitive terminal sequences of eukaryotic chromosomes have 3'-overhangs, which form a special quadruplex form of DNA.

This conclusion is based partly on indirect evidence that CpG motifs are considerably much less frequent in smaller viruses. Integrated \"genetic parasites\" like retroviruses are normally rich in CpG and are highly methylated.

Adult bats do not grow (as is the rule for mammals) and wing parameters (wing span and area) show growth curves with more or less pronounced plateau, which asymptotically leans to \"adult\" values. (This reflects progressive ossification of the cartilage.) As one could intuitively expect, variability in wing relative parameters decreases with age, meaning that juveniles before their first flights show more diversity in wing shapes than flying juveniles and those, in turn, approach gradually the narrow variability of these parameters of the adults.<\/li>\n<li>Juvenile bats start performing their first short flights even before weaning. The main requirement for the flight ability per se is a certain threshold value of wing loading. Sustained flights start roughly half-way to maturity and correlate with the emergence of the above mentioned plateau on the growth curves.

Lead is a good example of this, as it can take the place of calcium; I believe beryllium does the same for magnesium.<\/li>\n<li>Some metals themselves are very reactive.  Hexavalent chromium ($Cr(VI)$) is highly reactive, and will cause damage through severe oxidative reactions, whereas $Cr(III)$ is largely okay.<\/li>\n<li>A lot of metals are okay, even required, at some level, but become toxic at too high a concentration.  Iron, for example.<\/li>\n<li>People can simply have allergies to metals.  Nickel in silver jewelry is a good example, although in my experience it can be overcome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The basic gist is that some metals are required for life, some aren't but aren't too terrible, and some are completely toxic to it.  Different organisms can vary a bit in which metals are useful or not.  A good implant will of course not be toxic at all, and will be strong and long-lasting.

An Fe-O-O bent bond preserves more of the electronic character of the O2 molecule and promotes strong but reversible binding to Hemoglobin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The oxygen molecule forms a partial covalent bond with the iron in the heme (the ringlike molecule in the picture below <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ovXx.jpg\" alt=\"nice picture from Rice Univ Biotechnology intro class\"> ).  The lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom which forms the bond to the iron has a 120 degree angle with respect to the oxygen molecule itself.  In chemistry we say it is sp2 hybridized.  This implies a slightly greater than 120 degree angle between the Fe-O and the O-O axis would be energetically preferred in oxygen binding. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can see on the other end of the oxygen, there is a histidine sidechain nitrogen which interacts in a similar way - crooked at a similar angle to the oxygen molecule. <\/p>\n\n<p>As @MattDMo points out in the comments, it would not be 120 degrees exactly in fact even freshman chemistry molecular orbital theory would say that the double bond would take up more 'space' than the sp2 orbitals, widening out the angle Fe-O=O angle to be greater than 120 degrees.  Then the protein has its own geometry - the histidine and the heme iron are fixed in space and probably have their own location, so this is just an approximate, qualitative bond angle..<\/p>\n\n<p>The claims of <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/67/4/1846.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">superoxide formation<\/a> is because the oxygen is diamagnetic the iron and he oxygen, which are both paramagnetic, somehow pair to eliminate their magnetic moment.

The article curiously just says the highly reactive superoxide is kept from being chemically consumed by the hydrophobic pocket around it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The oxygen almost makes a superoxygen the iron sort of oxidizes but doesn't quite. Its also due to the peroxide like character of the oxygen molecule, partially bonded at both ends.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Still the point is that hemoglobin holds onto the oxygen by making a partial covalent bond.

At times this is insufficient and the Harbour Authority is using a mobile oxygenation barge built by McTay Marine with liquid oxygen stored in a tank.

The hydrogen bond is fairly weak (~ 0.5 kcal/mol) but water does a lot of hydrogen bonding.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So hydrogen bonding and polarity are often a shared characteristic of an molecule, but are not the same thing.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Ions are quite hydrophilic but do not need to be hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

Depending up on the nature of a person's body, this hormone controls the growth of the hair.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why shaving facial hair leaves the skin dry ?<\/p>\n\n<p>First let me explain the reason behind the oiliness of the skin. Sebum is produced by the sebaceous glands and is a complex made up of cholesterol, free fatty acids, glycerides, squalene, and wax esters. Sebum and sweat, along with the epidermal lipids discussed earlier, make up the oil on the surface of the skin. Some people will have more oily skin and some have less which depends on the nature of body.<\/p>\n\n<p>While shaving the sharp razor cuts the hair and also damages the skin and hair follicles. The level of damage to skin also depends whether you are shaving downwards or upwards. Because upward shaving usually causes more damage to skin and hair follicle. Complete detail of damage to hair follicle can be found in this article: <a href=\"http://blog.modernmechanix.com/exploring-the-science-of-shaving/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science of shaving<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shaving also removes skin lipids and water content creates pores which exposes the skin. If the surrounding atmosphere is dry then skin loses water. Or if the surrounding is moist or humid then water content will be balanced. That is the reason why we use artificial face moisturizer for immediate remedy to avoid infection and balance the wetness of face. So it takes a while for the skin to get back to normal state if nothing is done after shaving which sometime leads to acne or rashes due to infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another reason for dry face is use of hot water which removes skin oil instantaneously. So lukewarm water or cold water will further reduce the dryness of the skin. (Use of shaving cream with high alkaline content will obviously result in dry skin. This holds for soaps also.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Complete details can be found in the first link provided and <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/301811-my-skin-is-dry-after-shaving/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drying skin after shave<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10594,"question_id":10524,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10524/why-does-shaving-dehydrate-the-skin-is-there-an-hormonal-effect-involved","last_activity_date":1380231808,"creation_date":1379792951,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does shaving dehydrate the skin?

The difference being in the composition of the cell, particularly a nucleus contained within a membrane for eukaryotes, along with other membrane bound organelles, e.g. chloroplasts. They all share a common ancestor, according to this paper, that split 1.576 Bya (billion years ago) +/- 88 Mya (although it states the relationships are unresolved - it is often difficult to resolve relationships so deep in a tree). They form distinct groups known as Kingdoms under Linnaean based biological classification; the Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. Thus, in answer to your question, no, animals did not evolve from plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plants have chloroplasts in their cells, which provide the ability to produce energy via photosynthesis. It is thought that the chloroplast resulted from a symbiotic relationship between early plants and a cyanobacteria in that they both relied on each other for survival and so coevolved. Animals don't contain chloroplasts and instead contain an organelle called the mitochondria (although most plants also have mitochondria), which is also thought to have been a bacterial endosymbiont, probably related to <a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/6/reviews/1018\">rikettsias<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Protists also contain chloroplasts. The protists are intermediate between all three groups and have been notoriously difficult to classify, being placed into a fourth Kingdom, the Protozoa, although this grouping has been contested. The current Cavalier-Smith system was proposed in 2004 and classifies life into <a href=\"http://www.cladocera.de/protozoa/cavalier-smith_2004_prs.pdf\">6 Kingdoms<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from a single endosymbiotic event in Archaeplastida, although there are evidence to suggest some secondary endosymbiotic events. Check out <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/197\">this paper<\/a> for more information; figure 1 shows the relationships between the different groups and the endosymbiotic events.
