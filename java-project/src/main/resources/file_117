David -  First of all, what actually\n  makes something smell?   Molecules have to leave the smelly objects\n  and get to your nose through the air and that means that these\n  molecules must be very small and volatile.  That's to say they must be\n  easily evaporated.  The chemicals that make dogs smell are mostly what\n  we call volatile organic acids and they are produced by bacteria from\n  the fats that are breaking down from sweat; and that's maybe why we\n  find these body odours unpleasant.  They signal a presence of bacteria\n  and decay and death to us.   <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Their [dogs] skins mostly have\n  Staphylococcal bacteria, which don't produce much in the way of a\n  smell at all, but they've also got some yeasts too which are really\n  pongy.   But why does the smell seem worse when the dog is wet?  Here,\n  I think we have to go into some physics.  The amount of evaporation of\n  a substance is related to the concentration of the compound on a\n  surface it\u2019s evaporating from and the amount of compound that's in the\n  air, just above the surface.  <\/p>\n  \n  <p>So how might that change when it\u2019s wet? <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Well, if the organic acids are dissolved in water on the fur of the\n  wet dog, as the water evaporates, the concentration of those smelly\n  acids increases, so they'll evaporate more, so there are more\n  molecules in the air for us to smell.  Diana -   A bit of evaporation\n  can effectively amplify the amount of volatile chemicals that emanate\n  from a dog\u2019s skin, and Dr. Williams thinks it\u2019s the same effect that\n  causes that damp earth smell when it rains.  It may also alter how\n  dogs interact with each other when they're wet.  So, if you have a\n  dog, watch to see if it sniffs differently at other dogs on a dry day\n  versus a wet one...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There's a start, sounds legitimate to me...<\/p>\n","answer_id":2431,"question_id":2426,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1338479715}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2426/what-makes-a-wet-dog-so-stinky","last_activity_date":1338479715,"creation_date":1338363123,"answer_count":1,"title":"What makes a wet dog so stinky?","body":"<p>Similarly, what makes a wet down comforter so stinky?

As we get older the lens of the eye becomes stiffer and inflexible, which means that the muscles that pull on the lens can't flatten it as easily and focusing on nearby objects becomes difficult or impossible.  This is why we need to get bifocals or reading glasses as we are older.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The reasons for nearsightedness are '<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/tc/nearsightedness-myopia-cause\" rel=\"nofollow\">natural changes in the shape of the eye<\/a>'.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Mentioned briefly in the WebMD link above is that close work (e.g. reading, web surfing, phone videos, reading and reading, etc) tends to cause nearsightedness.   <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Near-sighted\" rel=\"nofollow\">25% of adults in the US and 40% of adults in Asia are myopic<\/a> and it does look as if there is a strong genetic component to myopia.  If neither parents have myopia, the incidence is only about 7%. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm probably going to get ding-ed for this, but I am going to offer alternative explanation, which makes good scientific sense to me, so hear me out. <\/p>\n\n<p>This seems like a poor adaptive phenotype for humans who are otherwise so optimized for survival.  Why would we naturally lose our ability so young (often before the fifth grade)?  So many people who have myopia are so impaired that they can't find their way around their own house (or legally drive) without glasses/contacts/corrective surgery. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is supported by studies which show that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8963918\" rel=\"nofollow\">non industrial societies have almost no natural myopia compared to industrialized ones<\/a>.  This is just one example reference, not a survey of all evidence.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Physiologically the explanation for myopia is this: in the relaxed state, the eye is focused at the horizon (infinity).  If one habitually focuses on a book or screen within 1-2 feet from your face, the muscles might well adapt to a set point that is closer than infinity.  This would make myopia an adaptive response to modern life.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Eye exercises are proposed as a way to correct myopia.  This is a bit controversial - some <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/191866-free-eye-exercises-for-near-sightedness/\" rel=\"nofollow\">say they help<\/a>, others say they <a href=\"http://www.allaboutvision.com/buysmart/see_clearly.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">do not<\/a>. I would not be surprised that myopia developed in youth (8-15 y.o.) when the eye and body are developing can't be overcome by eye exercises when you are 25-30, but the jury is still out. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are enough free descriptions of eye exercises out there that you don't really need to pay for them.  Getting young students outside to look around once in a while doesn't sound like a bad idea either, given this. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are going to down vote or complain, I would appreciate it if you please cite counter reasoning other than 'this is not a popular explanation'. <\/p>\n","answer_id":2439,"question_id":2323,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2323/cause-of-short-sightedness-far-sightedness","last_activity_date":1338409502,"creation_date":1337537925,"answer_count":1,"title":"Cause of short sightedness/ far sightedness","body":"<p>I recently had gone for an eye test.

In most cases the bacteria can sense when they are being hosted by the animal through quorum sensing mechanisms, and start producing light. <\/p>\n\n<p>The evolutionary pressure for the bacteria to produce light is to be in the protected environment of the animal which often feeds them. On the animal side, there can be several reasons to host the luminescent bacteria. In many cases, the evolutionary pressure is linked to reproduction. In order to successfully reproduce in the immensity of oceans, marine animals need to know that they are among their kind before they release their gametes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another example is the one of some deep see fish like the anglerfish which have developed a special \"flash light\" organ to host bio-luminescent bacteria. Fish can use the bacteria to emit a light to aid in camouflage, hunting, and attracting mates.

The questions are a bit anthocentric, and I think that's why folks with a bit more biological culture might be concerned about the answers.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Alpha type structures can be found in all sorts of animals.  Sperm competition, where many males simply mate with the female and let the sperm work it out are also v common from snakes to mice to primates.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its hard to say without you asking a more specific question, but the essential question is whether the competition occurs between the animals themselves or between the intermixed sperm of the males inside the female.  If that sounds gross, that's a typical reaction if you are not a monkey, snake, duck or mouse to name a few.  Different species choose different social roles in mating and for reasons that may be difficult to divine. <\/p>\n\n<p>For animals in an alpha troop modality, the alpha male will eventually get older or weaker and the younger ones will have their chance to mate.

The results are released into the blood stream for the most of the body to assimilate. <\/p>\n\n<p>With foods with complex carbohydrates (scenario 1), the results can be only a modest change in the glucose level in the serum.  This depends upon the specific food which you can understand better by researching the 'glycemic index'.  Highly glycemic foods result in rather short term release of simple carbohydrates glucose/sucrose into the blood.  Lower glycimic food contain complex carbohydrates (which are elaborate chains of sugars) which need to be broken up into simple carbohydrates before they are metabolized the the cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Foods which contain a lot of simple carbohydrates change the sugar levels in the blood nearly immediately and it can go quite high.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate\">simple carbohydrates are monomers or dimers of sugars<\/a>.  BTW complex carbohydrates have few pictures on the web, but you can imagine them as chains and networks of many many simple carbohydrates linked together.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Not all simple carbohydrates are used by human beings for energy.  For instance the glycosamine in 'joint juice' is the sort that makes cartilidge, which just to show you how different some complex carbohydrates can be. BTW i don't recommend joint juice, just trying to give a familiar example.  Its unlikely that the glucosamine you drink will be directly used for your joints!<\/p>\n\n<p>So glucose is the energy currency in the blood.  when the glucose level goes up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin\">insulin<\/a> is secreted by the pancreas which tells the cells to take up the glucose for glycogen (internal cell energy storage in a complex carbohydrate) or to be metabolized directly.  Diabetes results when insulin is not produced (type I) or when the cells stop responding to insulin (type II).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Human tolerance to glucose in the blood is estimated to be up to about 100 mg/dl long term. higher than this on the average is not healthy and can go up to several hundreds and cause lots of degeneration in the kidney, liver, and eyes, and more.  Exercise and fasting increase insulin sensitivity and athletes have blood glucose that is quite low even if they have a sugary beverage.  <\/p>\n\n<p>hope this helps - many keywords embedded within...<\/p>\n\n<p>One last note.  Fructose, which is about 45-60% of high fructose corn syrup (the rest is sucrose) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose#Liver_function\">is almost entirely metabolized in the liver<\/a>.  This is why fructose can be harmful to people who drink too much sweetened beverages.  With the liver taking in the vast majority of fructose, it tends to make fat out of it, sort of overdosing it to make it fatter than the rest of you relatively quickly.  Fatty liver is a marginally disfunctional liver and can cause health problems down the way.  Abdominal body fat (not on your love handles, but amongst your chest cavity and internal organs) is particularly harmful as it interferes with all sorts of organ function.

We could talk about how this trait is post-reproductive and about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">grandmother effect<\/a>, but I'm setting that aside for now.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The lack of statistical power of the study is also hampered because a mere 800 centenarians probably reflects dozens of different combinations of longevity groups.  (this is another reason all of these people are of specific european ancestry - to keep the number of variations in combinations down).  There are 281 significant mutations they found.   APOE is by far the most significant (fig1) but given the situation, just focusing on that one is not enough.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, even in flies it looks like <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110921/full/news.2011.549.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the sir2-1 gene is not a single mutant anti aging phenotype<\/a>.  When they cross the mutant strain with wildtype, the sir2.1 mutants live 15% longer.  Its at least one other mutation they had not detected in that caused a 50% longevity bump in the mutants.  Its probable that if there were 5 other important mutations, that the average crossover has one or more of these mutations with it too. <\/p>\n\n<p>In order to try to understand how these loci might work together to expand life span, they created clusters of these SNPs (interestingly half of them are in genes which is relatively rare).  these clusters of genes look like they affect the lifespan together.  the paper is open and all the 281 genes are downloadable, each one of them has a known biological property you can look at.  how they fit together is still to be determined, but their clusters might point the way for now. <\/p>\n","answer_id":2364,"question_id":2084,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2084/have-any-mutations-or-genetic-loci-been-associated-with-exceptional-longevity-in","last_activity_date":1337784841,"creation_date":1336050505,"answer_count":1,"title":"Have any mutations or genetic loci been associated with exceptional longevity in humans?","body":"<p>Individuals that avoid age-related diseases into later life are known as 'exceptional survivors', and have increased longevity compared to their 'controls' (those that were born at a similar time, yet have 'aged' and died sooner).

For a primitive animal living in water, an obvious advantage of bilateral symmetry is that it makes directed swimming easier.  If the animal were completely asymmetric, it would have to continually exert active control over its heading to be able to swim straight.   On the other hand, an even more symmetrical animal (such as one with 90&deg; rotational symmetry) might have trouble controlling its vertical and lateral heading separately, which could be a problem in aquatic habitats where staying at a certain depth is often useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Indeed, in many ways these reasons are the same as why pretty much all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft\">aircraft<\/a> are bilaterally symmetric: in the absence of active steering, we want them to fly straight and level.  That requires at least rough left&ndash;right symmetry and generally also some degree of top&ndash;down symmetry, although some breaking of the latter is usually needed both for landing and to account for the effects of gravity on flight dynamics.  We <em>could<\/em> build completely asymmetric aircraft if we wanted, they just would be harder to fly.)<\/p>\n\n<p>As for why this ancestral bilateral symmetry has survived so well throughout the course of evolution, that's presumably both because it's so deeply embedded in the genes that control our <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny\">ontogeny<\/a>, but also because the basic reasons why such symmetry is useful still remain, even though our size, shape, habitat and locomotion are very different from those of the first \"urbilaterian\".  Even though we mostly move by walking instead of swimming, it's still useful for us to be able to walk straight without having to pay constant attention to it.  Furthermore, once we've first learned to walk (or crawl) straight, it's useful that we can also learn to run, swim and jump (and ride a bike or drive a car) straight without having to always re-learn the exact amount of control needed to maintain a given heading with each of these modes of locomotion.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ps.

As I noted above, any significant deviation from that would cause issues with gait and balance.  Although such issues can certainly be adapted to and overcome with active control &mdash; after all, even people who've lost a whole <em>leg<\/em> manage to get around one way or another &mdash; they're presumably still significant enough to be selected against over evolutionary timescales, which is why our body shape remains so nearly symmetrical.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1815,"question_id":1814,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1334425903},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":9,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d5e678991b454a8c183888bc135f475?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":746,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/746/jake","reputation":172,"display_name":"Jake"},"score":0,"post_id":1816,"edited":false,"creation_date":1334497887,"comment_id":2352,"body":"<i>Afterthought: CG of human body is well known, could have inferred that both halves weigh the same.

A line from the interior to the exterior will usually pass through two lipid bilayers, one that is the inner wall of the nucleus, then through the outer wall.  This may seem like the inner wall is separate from, and nested inside, the outer wall, but it is not.  As nicely illustrated in your reference (<a href=\"http://www.molevol.de/publications/136.pdf\">Martin 2005<\/a>), the two walls are continuous with each other and not nested.

And how they do this depends upon which cells they are and what they are supposed to do.   A partial list: <\/p>\n\n<p>In multicellular animals, cells DNA 'ages' where the telomeres, sequences at the ends of the chromosomes, will be degrade and shorten.  This relates to how many times the cells have divided and acts as a sort of clock for development and probably also ageing.  Telomere degradation does not happen in all cells - the germline cells are not modified of course.  This is one of the probable reasons that cloning animals sometimes doesn't make perfect copies. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cells will also add Methyl groups to the DNA nucleotides.  Methylation is triggered when environmental or developmental conditions.  The textbook example for methylation is the markers on the DNA of children whose parents have experienced starvation conditions.  Methylation can disappear in subsequent generations.  It also happens to cells in the brain which mark different stages in their brain development.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Meiosis, When sexual mating happens, the cells that make the sperm and eggs shuffle the pairs of chromosomes, editing so that about half of the resulting single set of chromosomes contain half of each parent's chromosomes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then, there is DNA repair. When radiation or chemicals breaks the chromosome, there are enzymes that repair them. Usually they read the opposite strand of the DNA to see how the repair happens. Sometimes the DNA is not reparable from the strand, and the result is not the same as the DNA the cell started with.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Short repeat DNA seem to show up in chromosomes - segments of short repeats can change length (AGGAGGAGGAGGAGT -> AGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGTAGGAGG etc). I'm not sure how this happens, but its different between identical twins.

Once activated by a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the alpha subunit and the beta-gamma complex dissociate from the receptor and from each other. They can both go on to affect signaling by binding to various effector proteins, depending on the particular pathway in which they are involved, and their activities can be mediated by other proteins (e.g. the alpha subunit GTPase regulated by GAP proteins). <\/p>\n\n<p>I spoke to my Protein Engineering professor, and she also directed me to a few examples, although I'm not sure they're quite what you're looking for in the strictest sense.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclin-dependent kinases, as @Armatus mentioned, bind to all sorts of different cyclins. (I get the sense that subunits found in multiple protein complexes will probably be more common in signal cascades. I don't have any real data on that, but it makes sense that a signal protein could interact with two or more protein complexes and even have slightly different functions in each.) <\/li>\n<li>Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is an example of a protein with different quaternary structures between species. According to my professor, it occurs as a homodimer in mammals, but as a tetramer with some slightly different residues in budding yeast. I can't say whether the sequence changes are what affect the oligomerization, although my prof also mentioned \"oligomerization domains\" that could mediate protein-protein interactions.<\/li>\n<li>She also directed me toward a slightly more interesting example (in my opinion), though, again, it's also more along the lines of oligomerization. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) undergo something called \"dynamic subunit exchange\" and can take on a wide variety of oligomeric architectures. Binding is transient, but it's still kind of neat. There's a review here: <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411001903\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000411001903<\/a>.

The cornea works together with the lens to focus rays of light onto the retina.  The cornea accounts for two-thirds of the optical power of the eye (1) (i.e. the eyes capability to focus light), however unlike the lens is of fixed power. It is the lens that changes is shape by the action of suspensory ligaments and ciliary muscles in order to focus light by the correct amount depending on how far away the light originated from (and consequently the angle of incidence with the cornea).

What you need to do in order to make the correct map is try all possible positions of the restriction sites:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You start with HindIII and place it at position 0 of your vector.<\/li>\n<li>The KpnII site can be either at 2kb (left of HindIII) or at 8.5kb (right of HindIII).

Also, what do they mean by double digest to confirm ur analysis?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A double digest means that you cut your plasmid with two different restriction enzymes at the same time. As you already have a putative map of the plasmid, you can predict which would be the expected bands. If you observe the expected sizes, then your design is correct and your analysis are confirmed.<\/p>\n\n<p>To check which one is correct I would do a double digest with:\n1) SstI and PvuII, generating a 1.5kb and a 9kb bands if design a) is correct or                              3kb and a 7.5kb bands if design b) is correct\n2) StuI and SstI, generating a 4.5kb and a 6kb bands if design a) is correct or                             a 10.5kB band if design b) is correct           <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To confirm the \"ampicillin gene\" starts at kpn I 2.0 and end at the 3.0 stu I site right?? So the amp gene is 1 kB long?? So the relative position of the amp gene starts at 2.0 and ends at 3.0.\n  Why is it that in the question it says cloning into the kpn I and sst I sites abolishes ampicillin resistance whereas cloning on other sites does not?\n  What do they mean by this? Is the ampicillin resistance gene diff from the ampicillin gene??<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The ampicillin resistance gene and the ampicillin gene are the same. It refers to an enzyme (beta lactamase) which degrades ampicillin, and thus the cells that harbour the ampicillin-containing plasmid can survive when plated on ampicillin. <\/p>\n\n<p>Are you sure that the resistance is disrupted if cloning into SstI site and not StuI? If this is really the case, then the StuI site and SstI sites are next to each other, as first you have the SstI site, followed by StuI. The amp gene \nThe gene is a little above 1kb, so it starts upstream of KpnII and ends right after SstI, but it doesn't disrupt StuI. If something is cloned into KpnII or SstI sites, then the open reading frame of amp is disrupted, and the protein cannot be functional.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2255,"question_id":2254,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1337063996},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db7f504ad06993c5504937484aa29e22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":877,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/877/revown-sada","reputation":11,"display_name":"Revown Sada"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1337454244,"creation_date":1337454244,"body":"<p>Heres the solution<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UM0Mc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>i got 1 mark off for the position of Not I<\/p>\n","answer_id":2316,"question_id":2254,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2254/restriction-mapping-of-plasmid-assignment","last_activity_date":1337454244,"creation_date":1336933377,"answer_count":2,"title":"Restriction Mapping of Plasmid Assignment","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>pUWL22 is a circular, double stranded, 10.5 kb plasmid.

In this case they would need to only look over the data they put into their training. <\/p>\n\n<p>That might not answer your question though.

One might use pubmed's referencing feature, where you can start at these confirmed articles that describes the gene in question and use pubmed to show articles that have referenced that first article.  I'm not sure if this is accessible by API, but you can build an article graph by crawling the bibliographic references. <\/p>\n\n<p>For anything that was neither directly contradicted nor confirmed you would have to go back to google and look until you found something.  Clearly there are genes for which you will find no reference at all, and you will have to avoid these for confirmation.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if they checked for any biases here.

The hypothesis was based on the conjecture that there was so little phosphorus in the culture medium that phosphorous would have been replaced by arsenic in all its roles in the cell.  IF they had found arsenate DNA, it would have been derived from NTAs (nucleotide tri-arsenates) or a hybrid Phosphorous/Arsenic analog of the compound as DNA polymerase <a href=\"http://wiki.cstl.semo.edu/agathman/DNA%20polymerase.ashx\">consumes NTPs to create DNA<\/a>.  If there were only NTAs to drive DNA biosynthesis, then the cell's energy cycle would also have had to use ATA. <\/p>\n\n<p>BUT<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary evidence was that the mono lake strain grew in a fermentor (culture) with lots of arsenic (which is impressive) and very little phosphorous. <a href=\"http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2012/01/growth-of-gfaj-1-under-phosphate.html\">how little<\/a>? 3 micromolar. The investigators say that they did add a little phosphorus (3-5 micromolar), which, after some more careful accounting, appears to be enough to keep the bacteria growing at the observed rate <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/01/23/independent-researchers-find-no-evidence-for-arsenic-life-in-mono-lake/\">without using arsenate nucleotides<\/a> (<a href=\"http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2012/04/latest-on-our-arseniclife-manuscript.html\">submitted to Science<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>This is not completely surprising as the original publication in 2010 of a preliminary finding in <em>Science Express<\/em> which only had x-ray abosorbtion fine edge spectroscopy work consistant with an arsenate like that found in a phosphorus backbone.

There are three main lines of evidence pointed out in the <em>Science<\/em> reviews that were published after the initial publication of the paper.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The incorporation of arsenate ions into NTAs is not a plug-and-play process, <em>per se<\/em>. Arsenate does not simply replace phosphate ions from molecules. In order for an NTA to form, it must arsenylate (like phosphorylate) a ribose molecule, then have the purine/pyrmidine ring form (and be attached to the ribose), and then two more arsenates have to be linked via ester bond to the other first arsenate. Mind you, this all happens in water. Arsenate esters are notoriously unstable in water, so it's difficult to imagine an NTA forming stably.<\/li>\n<li>The original team in Felisa Wolfe-Simon's lab didn't intentionally add phosphate ions to their growth media; instead, the approximate amount of phosphate impurity was measured and reported. The lab compared this level of phosphate with the minimal levels reported in <em>E. coli<\/em> from another paper and basically said, \"There isn't enough phosphate in our growth media for our GFAJ-1 strain to grow solely on phosphorous.\" Well, that logic is a little <em>non sequitur<\/em>  because GFAJ-1 is a halomonad (they said so themselves) and there is literature pointing to a species within <em>Halomonadaceae<\/em> that can grow on phosphate levels <strong>lower than<\/strong> that of the impurities reported.<\/li>\n<li>Although the Wolfe-Simon team added arsenate into their growth media, it's unlikely that any biologically-useful arsenic ended up in the cells at all. Under physiological electrochemical conditions, arsenate gets reduced to arsenite. Phosphate ions, on the other hand, are stable at physiological potentials.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>All in all, there's a reason why life chose phosphorous instead of arsenic.

The 'critical thermal maxima' of many species of frogs have been\n  determined by several investigators. In this procedure, the water in\n  which a frog is submerged is heated gradually at about 2 degrees\n  Fahrenheit per minute.  As the temperature of the water is gradually\n  increased, the frog will eventually become more and more active in\n  attempts to escape the heated water.

Your claim is that starting at a high alcohol percentage, then gradually decreasing alcohol content, gets you intoxicated faster. @nico is correct that you will get drunk faster this way (more alcohol sooner rather than later, so this is trivial). If we allow only one variable to change, the alcohol content (and therefore the water content), then the first drink is the most potent, and each drink afterwards is getting progressively more dilute, then this implies you are able to rehydrate better the more you drink. This argues exactly opposite to your claim. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since you offered up the example of vodka to wine, this introduces two new important aspects: fermentation impurities and sugar content. Vodka is distilled and relatively pure, so it offers little in addition to alcohol and therefore easy to process by the liver. Scotchs and whiskeys are low sugar, higher impurities, and so would be a bit more troubling to filter and process. As you move down to wine, impurities rise and sugar content is <em>much<\/em> higher. This added sugar load dehydrates faster as well as causes a cascade of hormonal changes that are more immediately troubling than the alcohol. Beer would generally be the extreme end of the impurity and sugar continuum.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since you bring up the USSR and the KGB, I imagine that if they did stick to this regimen of interrogation, it could be more effective by power of suggestion.

The classic biological model of variation comes from accidents of history and environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Many mutations disappear over time because they aren't helpful (advantageous).  The reasons variations persist for more than a few generations is that our differences have helped us to live successful lives and (in biological terms of success) have offspring.  In europe the lactate dehydrogenase gene and others like it that help people digest milk is active through adult life as the result of domestication of milk producing animals,  in asia, this trait is rarer or non existent as agriculture does not produce milk there (in most cases). <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a broad difference, but its true in smaller ways for all of our individual traits, or so the theory goes.  Individual family traits are helpful to create stronger family bonds, so even something like distinctive dimples or foreheads have claim to being an advantageous trait.  Its possible that blonde hair is the product of such an advantage - its a strong signal to paternity if the father is blonde for instance. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another answer to your question I think, is that there are probably mechanisms in the cell or in mate selection that increase or decrease variation in the community at given times of stress.  For instance, snakes are among the animals who have a particular ability to select gender depending upon the conditions the female is experiencing.  more males may increase variation in the community - fewer males and more females will decrease it.  (not by a lot mind you, but a bit). <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional response added as requested:<\/p>\n\n<p>I see what you are getting at - why do children seem like such individual and unique things sometimes?<\/p>\n\n<p>In sexual reproduction, the offspring are the product of the shuffling of the parent's genomes through meiosis, where the pairs of chromosomes we have are combined to make a single chromosome that will be half of the children genome.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This process can result in completely novel combinations of genes while conveying many likenesses from the parent.  I would guesstimate that this is the major cause of the uniqueness of offspring/children.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Also in mammals there are some cell lines which splice families of genes which will cause offspring to be potentially quite different from either parent.  Immune genes for instance are created from scratch from a bunch of genes that the parents give.  Making each offspring unique but also the product of the parent's genetic repertoire.  This can be significant as it affects health and also to some extent attraction - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor_and_subconscious_human_sexual_attraction\" rel=\"nofollow\">studies have shown that people who smell attractive to us are immunologically distinct from us<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>@David mentions epigenetic variation, which is a more recent significant development.  During our life, the germline (sperm/egg) DNA may be chemically labelled depending upon environmental conditions we experience.  A famous example is <a href=\"http://epigenome.eu/en/2,48,872\" rel=\"nofollow\">experiencing famine conditions<\/a>, which caused the children to be born on the small side amongst other effects.   More recent studies have shown that this is a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7271/full/nature08514.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">widespread mechanism to control cells in our body during our lifetime as well as communicate to our offspring how life is<\/a>.

Even if you were to, say, spill a mixture of persistent broad-spectrum poisons on an area that killed off 99.9% of all species there, the remaining 0.1% that did survive would benefit from the lack of competition.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"great garbage patch\" is hardly so extreme a phenomenon, but similar effects can be seen there: some species suffer, others benefit.  In that sense, it's no different from any other changing habitat.<\/p>\n\n<p>From a conservation viewpoint, there are two issues here that one might find worrying:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>First, novel, extreme or rapidly changing habitats tend to have lower than average biodiversity, at least initially: the few species that thrive in the new environment tend to proliferate at the expense of others, forming a relatively simple (and often not very stable) food web.  Of course, over evolutionary timescales we'd expect the surviving species to adapt and diversify and the ecosystem to settle into a more stable state, but that tends to take a long time compared to the human timescale on which such novel habitats are created.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Also, the effects of the \"garbage patch\", or ecological changes in general, are not limited to the directly changed area.  Creating a new habitat in one part of the ocean is one thing; disrupting the ecosystem of the <em>entire<\/em> ocean is something else, as doing so leaves no unaffected refuge for the species that are harmed.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, fish, birds and marine mammals passing even just occasionally through the patch might end up swallowing plastic and accumulating it in their gut; meanwhile, even for less motile organisms, the patch might act as a population sink, depleting their population density in nearby areas.  And if some organisms, such as the sea skaters mentioned in the article you cite, thrive in the patch, the increased population will likely spill into other areas, potentially harming their competitors or prey species.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>As for why the news are focusing on the beneficial effects of the garbage to the sea skaters, well, that's what the study that prompted this current batch of news stories was about.  It's also seen as newsworthy precisely because it seems so unexpected: we've all heard stories of plastic flotsam <em>harming<\/em> wildlife, so finding out that some species are actually benefiting from it has some \"man bites dog\" style news value.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, it's a lot easier and more convincing to observe something that <em>is<\/em> there than something that isn't: we can directly <em>see<\/em> these insects laying their eggs on the bits of plastic, giving direct and incontrovertible proof of a causal connection.  Meanwhile, simply observing that some species used to be more common in the area of the patch than it is now is a lot less direct and informative: we might never be sure just <em>how<\/em> the patch is harming that species, and it always leaves skeptics an opening to claim that the decline <em>might<\/em> be caused by other factors.

This is then <strong>propagated<\/strong> along a nerve fiber until the target organ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, a neuronal cell has a body and several long extended structures that \"sprout\" from the cell body. <strong>Dendrites<\/strong> receive signals from other cells and they convey signals towards the cell body by creating small electrical currents. The <strong>axon<\/strong> is a single \"sprout\" that is usually much thinner and longer than the dendrites and it conveys action potentials from the near the cell body to target cells and organs. Some axons can be as long as 80-90 cm (imagine!)! At the place where axon leaves the nerve cell body there is a small protrusion called the <em>axon hillock<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The AP originates at a special part of the axon called the <em>axon initial segment (AIS)<\/em>. The initial segment is the first part of the axon as it leaves the cell body and sits immediately after the axon hillock.<\/p>\n\n<p>The electrical pulse is the short electrical discharge, that can be seen as a sudden movement of many charged particles from one place to another. In our cells we have ions of Na<sup>+<\/sup> (sodium), K<sup>+<\/sup> (potassium) and Cl<sup>-<\/sup> (chloride) (and in some cases also Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>) that constitute these charged particles. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are two types of driving forces for these particles: besides the <strong>potential gradient<\/strong>, e.g. the difference in the total charge in two different places there is also another force called <strong>concentration gradient<\/strong>, e.g. the difference in concentration at two different places. These force can point into opposite directions, and thus by exploiting one force (let's say concentration gradient) we can influence another one.<\/p>\n\n<p>What we need here again is a so-called <strong>semi-permeable membrane<\/strong>, this is just a barrier for ions, but only for specific ones. We need this because our main ions -- Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> -- are both positively charged. Therefore the cell membrane acts as a semi-permeable membrane, letting K<sup>+<\/sup> into the cells and Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> ions outwards but not the opposite. Therefore we have two <em>concentration gradients<\/em>: Na<sup>+<\/sup> (outside is the peak) and K<sup>+<\/sup> (inside is the peak).<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to start the pulse we need to initiate a massive ionic drift from one place to another. This is done by the cell, and the first event here is the drastic change (increase) of the permeability for Na<sup>+<\/sup> ions. Na<sup>+<\/sup> ions massively enter the cell and their charges, moved into the cell, form the upstroke of the <em>action potential<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The protective mechanism of the cell immediately start working against the Na<sup>+<\/sup> invasion and open the reserve shunts -- the K<sup>+<\/sup> channels. K<sup>+<\/sup> leaves the cell, taking away some charge and this is revealed as the decay of the action potential. But potassium channels are generally slower, that is why the decay of the pulse is more steady, not as sharp as the upstroke.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering now: what triggers the rapid change of membrane permeability then? There are several factors here that may contribute into this process.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Potential change of the membrane. Sodium and potassium channels are <strong>voltage-sensitive<\/strong>, meaning if you manage to change the resting potential of the membrane, formed due to concentration gradients and normally being about -90..-80 mV (millivolts) up to about -40 mV it will trigger the sodium channels. This is how the impulse propagates -- having originated at one place it just decreases the resting potential of the adjacent membrane area, sodium enters the cell there and the AP travels along the nerve. The AIS is the site of AP initiation because this part of the cell has a very high density of voltage-gated sodium channels.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Chemical agents, called neurotransmitters, can be detected by receptors on the cell membrane. Some of these receptors are ion channels themselves and open directly when neurotransmitter is bound. Other receptors act through intracellular signals to open ion channels. This is how the signal appears at the sites of nerve cell contacts -- neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine or adrenaline, just act here as triggers for membrane permeability.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":104,"question_id":91,"up_vote_count":18,"last_edit_date":1324304299},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1d3326342ee9de40822577d766465e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":72,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/72/yamad","reputation":2340,"display_name":"yamad"},"score":37,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user24"},"score":0,"post_id":110,"edited":false,"creation_date":1325526152,"comment_id":449,"body":"Neat summary to a broad question!

I'll try to outline the basic view.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, let's review how neurons signal between each other. The canonical way for a neuron to send a signal to a downstream neuron is by generating an <strong>action potential<\/strong>, the \"electrical impulse\" you have heard of. This action potential causes the release of neurotransmitter at a point where the two cells are very close to each other called a <strong>synapse<\/strong>. The downstream postsynaptic cell receives the neurotransmitter signal and converts it into a small electrical signal. If enough of these small electrical signals happen in a short time, they sum together and are likely to initiate an action potential in the second cell and the cycle repeats all along the circuit.<\/p>\n\n<p>How is the electrical signal generated? The basics of how this works was worked out most famously by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952. The short story is that the <em>plasma membrane is selectively permeable to ions<\/em>. Let's build the concept from the ground up.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The toolbox<\/h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Imagine a sphere of plasma membrane that represents a simple neuron. For starters, we assume that this membrane is bare lipid with no membrane-associated proteins. Because of the hydrophobicity of the bilayer, charged particles cannot diffuse through the membrane. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The cell is bathed, inside and outside, in a solution containing many <strong>ions<\/strong> (charged atoms), including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+). As we noted above, these ions cannot go through the membrane without \"help\".<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Now we add an <em>ion pump<\/em> protein into the membrane which will pump sodium ions out and potassium ions in. This particular pump, the <strong>Na-K ATPase<\/strong>, creates an excess of sodium ions outside the cell and an excess of potassium ions inside.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Now we add a potassium <strong>ion channel<\/strong> to the membrane. This protein creates a pore in the membrane that only allows potassium ions through. This particular protein's pore is always open. Now things start getting exciting...<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>What do the potassium ions do now that they can go through the membrane? Ions will move based on the forces created by their <strong>electrochemical gradients<\/strong>. The pump created a chemical gradient by putting excess K+ inside, so the K+ ions start to flow out through the ion channels. But K+ ions are positively charged, so when they flow out, positive charge starts building up outside and negative charge builds up inside. This electrical gradient opposes the chemical gradient, tending to pull the K+ ions into the cell while the chemical gradients pulls K+ ions out. The influx and efflux reach an equilibrium at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation\">Nernst potential<\/a>, where the electrical and chemical forces equal out. For physiological concentrations of K+ ions, the K+ equilibrium potential is about -80mV or -90mV. This means that K+ ions will flow until the outside of the cell is 80-90mV more positive than the inside of the cell. We started at 0mV, so K+ ions mostly flow out.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>We now have a <strong>membrane potential<\/strong>, a difference in electrical potential between the inside and the outside of the cell at about -80mV (usually closer to -70mV or -60mV in \"real life\"). In particular, this membrane potential is the <em>resting potential<\/em> that exists when the cell is not active. We can simplify for now and think of the resting potential as being set by a resting permeability of the membrane to potassium ions, but not to sodium ions. We call this membrane polarized, and thus <strong>depolarization<\/strong> is when the membrane potential becomes more positive, and <strong>hyperpolarization<\/strong> is when the membrane potential becomes more negative.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Now, we add to the membrane a <strong>voltage-gated sodium channel<\/strong>, an ion channel that passes only sodium ions but is usually closed. The voltage-gating means that this ion channel is sensitive to the membrane potential. At the resting potential, the pore is closed and the membrane is still impermeable to sodium ions. When the membrane potential becomes slightly more positive, the channels opens and sodium ions can flow. This channel is also <em>inactivating<\/em>, so that when it opens it only opens for a short period of time, letting in a limited amount of sodium.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>What way will sodium flow when we open this channel? Because of the negative resting potential (-70mV) and the excess of sodium ions outside due to the pump, both the electrical and chemical gradient will drive sodium ions into the cell. The sodium equilibrium potential is usually around +60mV.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>To complete the machinery for generating an action potential, we also add a <strong>voltage-gated potassium channel<\/strong> to the membrane. It works just like the voltage-gated sodium channel that is also closed at rest and opens when the membrane potential becomes more positive. This channel opens a bit more slowly than the sodium channel does, but it does not inactivate.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h2>Generating an action potential<\/h2>\n\n<p>Ok, so how do these parts come together to create an electrical impulse?<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The cell sits at its resting membrane potential, with all of its voltage-gated channels closed. It receives a signal from an upstream cell that causes a slight depolarization. The action potential will initiate when the membrane potential hits the <strong>threshold potential<\/strong>. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>At the threshold potential, the voltage-gated sodium channels open letting sodium ions flow into the cell. The sodium flux pulls the membrane from the resting potential (-70mV) towards the sodium equilibrium potential (+60mV). These values are far apart, so the driving force is large and the membrane depolarizes rapidly. This is the action potential <strong>upstroke<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The depolarization also activates the (slightly slower) voltage-gated potassium channels. The potassium ions flow out and drive the depolarized membrane (about +20mV at the action potential peak) back towards the potassium equilibrium potential (-80mV). At the same time, the sodium channels are inactivating so that sodium is no longer depolarizing the membrane. The repolarization rate is usually slower than the depolarization rate. This is the action potential <strong>downstroke<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The whole process of the action potential depolarization/repolarization cycle takes about 2-3 milliseconds in an \"average\" neuron. Once the cell reaches resting potentials again, the membrane is basically reset. The voltage-gated channels are turned off. The ion pump moves the potassium ions that flowed out and the sodium ions that flowed in. That patch of membrane is ready to fire another action potential!<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>As a final note, I'll mention that the voltage-gated sodium channel provides a mechanism for the action potential to <strong>propagate<\/strong> down the axon. The action potential is initiated in one location of the cell, and creates a depolarization. This depolarization causes the voltage-gated sodium channels in neighbouring regions of the membrane to open and generate an action potential cycle of their own.

These features supposedly 'couldn't have evolved' but of course one's disbelief doesn't make anything true or untrue. This is what Dawkins calls 'argument from personal incredulity'. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let me also point out a few evolutionary counter arguments to such reasoning.<\/p>\n\n<p>The presence of selection radically changes what is 'likely' or 'possible' to happen. For example, you wouldn't argue that it's highly improbable that the stones on the beach are ordered by size, if you know that the action of waves orders them in a certain way. Dawkins' weasel (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program<\/a>) also demonstrates this principle. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another Dawkins' argument is that, contrary to what creationists claim, complex features such as eye don't have to be completely functional to be useful. In the early history of life, when no organism had eyes, any simple system which could distinguish light from darkness could provide a huge advantage to its owner. The simple system can then evolve to a more complex one to provide a competitive edge etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, evolution happens over time scales we cannot grasp.

So, to you a slight increase in intelligence might be unnoticeable, but in a naturally selecting system it would be very noticeable. Don't mix up sexual selection (where the preference of one sex shapes the selection of genes) with natural selection (where fitness to the environment shapes the selection of genes). Sexual selection may or may not have helped shape brain evolution, I can't produce evidence that it did.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the increased fitness that slight gains in intelligence convey are easier to create evolutionary anecdotes about. It's simplistic to speak of just \"intelligence\" as evolving. Many different nervous structures evolved through out the animal kingdom, each with a function that directly increased fitness. I get the feeling that you're specifically talking about the evolution of the neocortex, because you reference human intelligence.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what I guess you're really asking is what evolutionary advantage does the neocortex convey? The answer isn't that hard, once you understand a little about the neocortex. It is an organ that simply models the external and internal world as perceived by your sensory organs. By external world, I mean modeling things like vision, hearing, touch, etc... By internal world, I mean modeling the actions you can perform, the plans you make, and so on. Increasing the size of the neocortex is essentially increasing the possible complexity of these models. Not only can you find more subtle and complex patterns <em>out there<\/em>, you can develop increasingly subtle plans and ruses too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Watching documentary footage of tribal hunters provides a really stark look at just how useful the neocortex is. It frames our intelligence in terms of a situation similar to one we evolved in. It's not hard to imagine why the growth has been explosive. Outsmarting other animals is a great niche that in our evolutionary history was virtually unexploited.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2099,"question_id":2093,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b219b646efa3c74061977c39306c1841?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":810,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/810/shep","reputation":1198,"display_name":"Shep","accept_rate":67},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/487b39e86dd577c22005472b9a307b1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":826,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/826/jez","reputation":159,"display_name":"Jez"},"score":0,"post_id":2101,"edited":false,"creation_date":1336160601,"comment_id":2780,"body":"OK, so I ask you the same question I did Preece; if this is such an obvious selection mechanism, why is it so extremely rare in evolution (only ever happened in humans)?

To answer the question, my friend is a horticulist and has given a more detailed answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Subspecies is the most generic, <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">taxonomically-defined<\/a> term one rank order lower than species. The subspecies (either an individual subspecies, or collective group of subspecies) are defined to be genetically or morphologically distinct among other subspecies belonging to the same species, yet still produce viable offspring from interbreeding. For example, every type of dog is a sub-species of <em>Canis familiaris<\/em>, and all dogs are capable of breeding with each other. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Subspecies<\/a>, abbreviated Ssp, may refer to an individual subspecies type, or a collective group of related subspecies when a distinct subset is difficult to define or unknown.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a variety of terms that are analogous to subspecies, when the strict definition does not apply, or a different term has been used historically. For example, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varietal\" rel=\"nofollow\">varietal<\/a> is the botanical term, and refers to a named subspecies. For example, grapes are a family of species, divided into the various subspecies, and a varietal is a specific subspecies that we refer to by a more common or familiar name, such as Riesling, Chardonnay, etc. (Grapes are a slightly different case in which most grapes are produced from hybrids or crosses for reasons of withstanding environmental conditions avoiding insect prey and fungal infections.) Microbiology has yet another distinction, called a strain. Strains are often genetically different, and yet all belong to a species. For example, several E. coli strains exist. In contrast, viruses are also given strain/subspecies names which don't technically fit the ICZN definition of interbreeding. Cultivar is a similar term, also from the field of botany. Cultivar is specifically applied to plants that are grown for some agricultural benefit, and have been bred or altered by humans for some reason.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, there is a zoological definition of subspecies set out in ICZN. This definition requires viable interbreeding among subspecies belonging to the same species. The term applies to individuals, or groups, as the context dictates. Analogous terms of subspecies are applied (adapted?) to other realms of biology, such as botany, microbiology and virology, but the definitions are slightly different, but consistent within the branch of biology (eg, viruses can't breed so they don't fit the ICZN definition, but the term applies). Ssp can also be qualitatively used to describe an unknown subset of a species (I've seen this used in microbiology mostly).<\/p>\n\n<p>Crosses/hybrids are indicated with the \"x\" in the nomenclature. Since I found this confusing, I'm copying from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_%28biology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From a taxonomic perspective, hybrid refers to offspring resulting\n  from the interbreeding between two animals or plants of different\n  species.<\/p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Hybrids between different subspecies within a species\n  (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as\n  intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the\n  same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are sometimes known as\n  interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera\n  (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>The second type of hybrid consists of crosses between populations,\n  breeds or cultivars within a single species. This meaning is often\n  used in plant and animal breeding, where hybrids are commonly produced\n  and selected because they have desirable characteristics not found or\n  inconsistently present in the parent individuals or populations. This\n  flow of genetic material between populations or races is often called\n  hybridization.<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_%28biology%29#Examples_of_hybrids\" rel=\"nofollow\">horticultural examples<\/a> of crosses in which an example of interspecific and intergeneric hybrids, and others, are shown.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1976,"question_id":1975,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1336010319}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1975/does-the-use-of-var-x-and-or-ssp-in-a-scientific-name-provide-specific-i","last_activity_date":1336010319,"creation_date":1335397097,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does the use of \"var\", \"x\", and/or \"ssp\" in a scientific name provide specific information?","body":"<p>What exactly does it mean when a plant has a scientific name that specifies a vairety, for example  <em>Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides<\/em>, or when the name includes an \"x\", as in <em>Populus maximowiczii Henry x trichocarpa<\/em>, <em>Populus xcanadensis<\/em>, or \"Crataegus x macrocarpa\"?<\/p>\n\n<p>All of these species are in the USDA Plants database (of plants that occur in the US).

It's one of the responses cells take when something goes wrong-- DNA damage, viral infection, telomere depletion, that sort of thing. Senescent cells have stopped proliferating. We have a word for cells that don't stop proliferating, and that word is \"cancer\". So, p16-INK4a is a major tumor suppressor.

Similarly, restricting the intake of nutrients to the <em>minimum without causing malnutrition<\/em> also extends lifespan in lab animals (including primates [2]).<\/p>\n\n<p>Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR pathway (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) - specifically mTORC1 (Complex 1) - which influences protein synthesis, autophagy and inflammation (among others). Upstream factors of mTOR include nutrient availability and insulin signaling (see \"Deconvoluting mTOR biology\" for good review [3]).<\/p>\n\n<p>It has been hypothesized that the lifespan-extending effects of caloric restriction (CR) are mediated by mTOR (one can see why - mTOR is affected by nutrient availability).

On the other hand, CR (most of the different types) seems to be <em>mediated<\/em> by mTOR - this difference is critical: mTOR is not necessarily inhibited by CR, it is just required for its effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore combining rapamycin and CR is unlikely to have an additive effect as rapamycin may override any influence CR has on mTOR signaling, but I have not seen a study in which this has been tried. Combing different methods of CR (or developing drugs to do just that) may well have additive lifespan-enhancing effects.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, et al.

Restriction digestion of PCR products will only work if there are at least a few bases on either side of the recognition site so that the restriction enzyme is able to \"grab on\" to the DNA.

The back of the TOPO manual tells you how to do this as well as many other sources. Ligate this using your TOPO kit to produce a shuttle vector that you can then doubly digest your insert out and gel purify it. Then you may ligate this purified, digested DNA with your previously digested destination vector.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong> that in my hands and in others in our lab, topoisomerase is unstable and has a short half-life. It is especially sensitive to temperature changes (warming from -20&deg;C to 4&deg;C) which you wouldn't expect since it is designed to work at room temperature. The vector is not affected, but without a working topoisomerase, the ligation step does not occur and the DNA does not transform.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As an aside:<\/strong> If you plan on doing more cloning in the future and need to replace the kit, I would recommend getting the basic TOPO TA cloning kit, clone your PCR product (with 3'-A overhangs) into the vector, transform, pick white/light blue colonies for screening then cut out from the TOPO vector (the shuttle vector) for downstream applications.

The first is Kenneth Rothman's <em>Epidemiology: An Introduction<\/em>, which I'm affectionately going to refer to as \"Baby Rothman\" from hereon out for reasons that will become obvious.<\/p>\n\n<p>Baby Rothman is an excellent \"getting your feet wet\" book. It's simplistic, and clearly designed for someone with no background in Epidemiology, so it starts from things that, if you have a statistical background, you might find a bit dull. But it accomplishes two key tasks:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A basic treatment of the subject from a pre-eminent methodologist and advocate for the field that doesn't make some of the sloppy slight-of-hand mistakes many introductory books do.<\/li>\n<li>An introduction to the \"vocabulary\" of Epidemiology as a field - what we call things, how we thing about effect estimates, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The second book I would buy would be <em>Modern Epidemiology: 3rd Edition<\/em> by Rothman, Greenland and Lash. This is <em>the<\/em> definitive reference book for most epidemiological methods  currently used in the field. As I said on a related <a href=\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/21405/good-reference-book-for-epidemiology\">CrossValidated<\/a> question, ME3 is the only epidemiology book that has always come with me, regardless of what project I'm doing, and which I have routinely found invaluable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other benefit of the book is that it's \"platform agnostic\". It's not going to try to teach you a statistics package - its going to teach you the science and philosophy of Epidemiology, the actual doing of the science, rather than the toolkit. Without that kind of methodological rigor, you can be a wizard at your language of choice and still do bad science.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I were only going to buy one book, it would be ME3.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1996,"question_id":1917,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1917/could-someone-recommend-an-introductory-book-on-epidemiology","last_activity_date":1335506220,"creation_date":1335053995,"answer_count":4,"title":"Could someone recommend an introductory book on epidemiology?","body":"<p>I'm hoping to learn the basics of epidemiological methods, terminology, etc. I come from a background in statistical economics, and I'm moving into the economics of public health.
