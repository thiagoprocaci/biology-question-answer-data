I'll go through your three questions sequentially.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Q1: Why does lower capacitance increase \"the effectiveness of nearby nodes\" or allow the depolarizing voltage to \"travel not by ion diffusion, but as an electric field\"?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A: Capacitance basically results in sequestering of charge of opposite polarities along the cell membrane, which basically results in a neutralization of charge differences. The effect of this is explained on the website of <a href=\"http://amrita.vlab.co.in/?sub=3&amp;brch=43&amp;sim=137&amp;cnt=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amrita<\/a> and I quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] a higher capacitance results in a lower potential difference. In a cellular sense, increased capacitance requires a greater ion concentration difference across the membrane.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What myelin does is insulating the neuron, thereby decreasing its capacitance. You could say that by increasing the thickness of the membrane, the negative insides of the cell do not attract positive charge outside the cell. It's a bit simplified, yet it effectively describes what myelin does (<a href=\"http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part1a/intro_to_circuits/Capacitors3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">see cambridge web page on capacitance<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>So in a myelinated axon, when Na<sup>+<\/sup> enters the cell in a node of Ranvier, the positive charge entering the cell is not counterbalanced by outside negative charge and hence, the charge is not or at least less counterbalanced. This allows for the depolarizing potential to be transmitted by electric charge. If there were no myelin, the depolarizing potential would fade out pretty quickly along the axon by neutralizing charges outside the cell. Without myelin the opening of more sodium channels in the direct vicinity are necessary not only to transmit the action potential across the axon, but it is also necessary to amplify the signal to prevent it from dying out. In a myelinated axon, hence, the depolarizing potential reaches much farther and in answer to your next question:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Q2:This allows us to say that Î», or the rate of spatial decay of potential, increases, decreasing the effective length of the neuron. Why should its decrease help faster conduction?)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One could say that myelination effectively decreases the length of the axon (the lamba parameter) as the depolaring potential reaches further along the axon.    <\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that the depolarizing potential reaches further means that voltage-operated sodium channels can be activated at larger distances from a certain depolaring potential. Hence, adjacent nodes of Ranvier can be spaced by as much as 1.5 mm. Due to the fact that the next node is activated by passive spread of an electric field, which is pretty much instant, it skips the intervening distance with about light speed, greatly enhancing conduction velocity. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Q3: And another question is, how would reduced density of sodium voltage gated channels cause a decreased capacitance?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Basically there are no ion channels below a myelin sheath as they are totally useless there. It is the myelin that decreases capacitance and there happen to be no channels underneath.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24260,"question_id":13986,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13986/how-is-membrane-capacitance-related-to-the-increased-speed-of-saltatory-conducti","last_activity_date":1436164986,"creation_date":1387119307,"answer_count":2,"title":"How is membrane capacitance related to the increased speed of saltatory conduction?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8282/why-is-saltatory-conduction-faster-than-continuous-conduction\">Here<\/a> is the original question which inspired my question. As explained by the answers there, the reason saltatory conduction in myelinated neurons is faster than non-myelinated conduction is because the capacitance of the membrane is lowered by reducing the number of channels (Channel density) or equivalently, increasing the spacing between channels. I also did a preliminary study of membrane electrodynamic modelling <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cable_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Electrical_properties_of_cell_membranes\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>From what I gathered from the linked question, the decreased capacitance overcompensates the effect of absence of channels reinforcing the sodium current, and on the whole, increases the speed of conduction by allowing the depolarizing potential to travel to the adjacent node faster than in case of an unmyelinated fibre. In view of this, I have a question:-  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Why does lower capacitance increase \"the effectiveness of nearby\n  nodes\" or allow the depolarizing voltage to \"travel not by ion\n  diffusion, but as an electric field\"?

The cells responsive to sound, the hair cells, are located along the <em>basilar membrane<\/em> (BM). Going from base (high frequency) to apex (low frequency), the BM becomes wider and less stiff, making it more susceptible to encode low frequencies apically.

Of those molluscs species, about 70'000 are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropoda\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Gasteropoda<\/em><\/a>. <em>Gasteropa<\/em> is most diverse <em>Mollusca<\/em> phylum.<\/p>\n\n<p>The winding you describe is present in all <em>Gasteropoda<\/em> and is often called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(gastropod)\" rel=\"nofollow\">the torsion<\/a>. So the answer to why there are so many molluscs that make a torsion is simply, because of phylogenetic independence. The torsion evolved only once in the gastropods. The answer to the more specific question, why is the torsion right handed rather than left handed in all gastropods is 1) phylogenetic independence again. The torsion evolved only once and was therefore either sinistral or anti-sinistral. There is no need for an explanation of why they are all sinistral because the observations are not independent.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why has the torsion evolved at first place?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One may ask <code>but why did the torsion evolved at first place?<\/code>. I think the reasons are still to be discovered. The following is a summary of what I read on wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(gastropod)#Evolutionary_roles\" rel=\"nofollow\">torsion#evolution<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"Why torsion is bad\"<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As a result of this torsion, the anus is found next to the mouth which is an obvious hygiene issue and therefore seems rather deleterious. Moreover, there are a whole bunch of issues about organs spinning around and entwining. Also, ventilation seems to be reduced by the torsion which is pretty deleterious.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"Why torsion is good\"<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>However, because there's no \"hole\" left in the posterior position, the torsion may help preventing sediments. Some have suggested that the torsion may allow to move sensory organs closer to the head. The most likely explanation is that the torsion might have evolved as a defense mechanisms against predation as torsion allow an organism to hide its head behind its shell. Finally, citing from wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The evolution of an asymmetrical conispiral shell allowed gastropods to grow larger but resulted in an unbalanced shell. Torsion allows repositioning of the shell, bringing the centre of gravity back to the middle of the gastropod\u2019s body, and thus helps prevent the animal or the shell from falling over.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note also that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whatever original advantage resulted in the initial evolutionary success of torsion, subsequent adaptations linked to torsion have provided modern gastropods with further advantages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Why sinistral rather than anti-sinistral<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To repeat myself, we only have one single observation of torsion (as it evolved only once) and this observation is either sinistral or anti-sinistral. It sounds therefore quite likely that stochastic processes have driven the evolution of sinistral (rather than anti-sinistral) torsion. In other words, the first mutation allowing for some degree of torsion was probably causing a sinistral torsion and this is it.<\/p>\n\n<p>But there might eventually be a more functional reason for why torsion evolved to be sinistral. The reasons would then be related to the already existing asymmetry of organs. For example, anti-sinistral torsion may yield to more entwining between the gut and the respiratory system, or to not squeeze too much the one lung, who'd be smaller than the other one due to the presence of circulatory organs. I don't have enough knowledge in the anatomy of the molluscs ancestors to have a good intuition of whether I'd expect sinistral or anti-sinistral torsion to be more beneficial.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35796,"question_id":35792,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1436122825}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35792/are-there-any-theories-why-such-an-imbalance-in-chirality-of-molluscs","last_activity_date":1436122825,"creation_date":1436115413,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any theories why such an imbalance in chirality of molluscs?","body":"<p>Most gastropods exhibit sinistral  (right hand) winding of their shells.

Many of these organs have a heterogenous mixture of endocrine cells sharing the same glandular space.<\/p>\n\n<p>There appear to be some glands that are considered \"master glands\" such that they take a variety of relatively independent input, apply some control logic via a diverse set of endocrine cells and tissue and secrete a diverse hormonal output. The pituitary and hypothalamus are the best examples, however the adrenal cortex and the pancreas also fit this definition to a certain extent. Many times the diversity of hormones and cells within an organ have no obvious connection (eg thyroid). Some glands appear more specialized with a relatively straightforward endocrine axis of input and output (eg testes).<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of this multifunctionality seems unnecessary, in that insulin secretion could occur anywhere and be effective in the manner of an insulin pump, or contain risks due to excessive centralization as in a pituitary tumor or renal artery stenosis, so there must be some advantages I do not understand.<\/p>\n\n<p>My textbook (Headley, Levine, 6th) seems to minimally cover multiplexing, signal cross-talk and competition between diverse endocrine cells sharing an organ.

Thats the whole point of glycerol use, which we use in our lab at 50% (v/v) to store bead bound proteins. Thats also why antibodies and restriction enzymes are stored in glycerol since freeze thawing antibodies dissolved in water often leads to their degradation, although you only tend to store stuff in glycerol, like restriction enzymes, if the concentration of the protein is very very high. One golden trick I use is aliquoting my samples and snap freeze them in liquid nitrogen and store in -80 freezer. I'm curious as to what happens with your protein, does it degrade after a freeze thaw cycle? (I'm aware that transmembrane proteins are notorious when it comes to storage/maintenance due to their awkward hydrophobic transmembrane region so its best to speak to an x-ray crystallography expert, if there is some one like that roaming around your research lab :), since they have face problems like this quite frequently and have excellent suggestions). Are your proteins GST tagged and bound to glutathione agarose beads? or you use HIS tags and nickel beads and elute the purified protein through imidazole? i suspect it is GST in which case its probably not a good idea to snap freeze although I have (somehow) had frozen glycerol beads at -20 and they were fine after use. I have had a friend talking about protein purification and the fact that protein isolation has to be done fresh so you might have to go down that root if your current method is not ideal. Also one last question, are you purifying you protein bacterially or they get secreted into the media? I suspect if its a membrane protein you are using the cell based system since if it was E. coli you were using (as suggested above) you could have just had your protein expressed through IPTG and just washed you cell pellet in STE buffer and spun it down hard and stored the pellet at -20, in which case would save you some time in the purification process. The use of Na azide is a good idea too but I only use it for primary antibody storage which is already dissolved in the block buffer such as 5%-BSA-TBST for WB and store the whole thing at 4 oC and Na azide is there to prevent BSA and the Ab going off.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main problem many many people have, including my self is that the majority of times, over expressed protein is insoluble or just doesn't get expressed in certain systems so you are very lucky to have a working system.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is all I know about protein storage.

The molecular receptor sensing isothiocyanates is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_cation_channel,_member_A1\" rel=\"nofollow\">transient receptor channel A1<\/a> (TRPA1) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5237/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ref]<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here a simplistic view of how ingredients are perceived:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/i83wb.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<h2>Gustatory sensation<\/h2>\n\n<p>First we get a burning sensation in the buccal cavity due to TRPA1 receptors present on the surface of the sensory neurons of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve#Sensory_branches\" rel=\"nofollow\">trigeminal nerve<\/a>. In essence isothiocyanates dissolved in the saliva will activate those neurons via TRPA1 provoking electrical impulses in the trigeminal nerve which leads to a burning sensation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Retronasal olfactory sensation<\/h2>\n\n<p>For several food ingredients we also perceived an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor\" rel=\"nofollow\">aroma<\/a> (taste = gustation, aroma = olfaction, taste + aroma = flavor). The aroma of an ingredient is perceived by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptor_neuron\" rel=\"nofollow\">olfactory sensory neurons<\/a> in the nasal cavity and because some of the ingested ingredient will be vaporized inside the buccal cavity and travel through the nasal cavity where they are perceived (retronasal perception).<\/p>\n\n<p>Not so surprisingly, isothiocyanates will again be perceived by sensory cells of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">olfaction system<\/a> via TRPA1 hence a burning sensation in the nostrils.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How receptor activation leads to a neuronal stimuli<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is a very broad subject and I will only give an overview of what is happening. We first start with the activation of a receptor by an agonist (in your question, isothiocyanates binding and activating TRPA1). Upon binding of the agonist the conformation of the receptor will change from an inactive to an active state. The way the signal is transduced varies according to the type of receptor but for the TRPA1 channel what happens is that the channel opens leading to an influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the cells which changes its electrical state (as calcium ions are positively charged), a phenomena called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization\" rel=\"nofollow\">depolarization<\/a>. Depolarization of specific sensory cells (here the one expressing TRPA1) start an electrical signal in the nerve which travels to the brain where it is then decoded. The exact way the brain decodes sensory signals is still under debate but a likely explanation is that only some neurons within the nerve are activated which allows the brain to decode the sensory signal based on the nerve activation pattern. As an analogy, it would be the same as having only specific wires (neurons) turned on within a bundle of wires (nerve).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Further reading<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you want to further extend your knowledge on taste perception at the molecular level read this excellent review <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/nature05401.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chandrashekar, 2006<\/a>.

Evolutionary Biology is a big field and I would recommend that your take some time to get an introduction (slightly more advanced than what you received in school). I am suggesting you take advantage of <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_01\" rel=\"nofollow\">this free online resource<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am briefly making comments and answering your question(s) below. They may be hard (or easy, I don't know) to understand but for more info you should really get to the above free online resource.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Species A evolved from species B<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution did not make mammals out of reptiles, mammals are reptiles. Evolution did not make birds out of reptiles, birds are reptiles as well (I am using here the phylogenetic definition of reptiles (<em>Reptilia<\/em>), more info <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35370/if-dinosaurs-could-have-feathers-would-they-still-be-reptiles\">there<\/a>). It is wrong to think of any two extant species as one having evolved from the other one. But it is correct to understand how closely related are two extant species. It is also correct to make predictions about how the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) look like and it is true the the MRCA might look more like one of its descendents than like another.<\/p>\n\n<p>We talk about clade as a lineage including many species. In these terms both any lizard species and any given bird species belong to the same clade, the <em>Reptilia<\/em>, they are both reptiles. They are also both vertebrates (<em>Vertebrata<\/em>) and animals (<em>Metazoa<\/em>) and eukaryotes (<em>Eukaryota<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>If the statements of the kind \"mammals evolved from reptiles\" are very misleading the statement \"amphibians evolved from reptiles\" is simply wrong. The MRCA of reptiles and amphibians was not a reptile (neither an amphibian), it was a tetrapoda (vertebrate).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>I can roughly imagine that there are giant evolutionary gaps between an insect and a jellyfish but is there any common ancestor of all of them?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Any two species on earth have a common ancestor. The universal common ancestor, that is the common ancestor that any living thing (bacteria, plants, lizard, human, fungi, jellyfish, Archea, etc...) is called LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor). So yes, jellyfish and insects have a common ancestor. LUCA is one of them. Their MRCA is the same guy as the MRCA between jellyfish and you, as insects and primates are more closely related than are insects and jellyfish. This MRCA is an animal (a <em>metazoa<\/em>) and therefore is also a eukaryote (<em>Eukaryota<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do they also have some evolutionary table like vertebrates or was there evolution never that interesting to begin with?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution occurs in every single living population. So yes, evolution occurs in jellyfish as it occurs in insects. The clade of jellyfish contains several thousands of species (most of them belong to the clade <em>Hydrozoa<\/em>). There are almost a million species of insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are just a few fun facts that come to my mind when I think about jellyfish:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some species have tentacles, some don't.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some species have <em>alternance of generation<\/em> (a given individual is either a sticking thing on the ground while its descendent is swimming).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Size of jellyfish vary wildly<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>And a few fun facts about insects:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some have evolved 3 pairs of wings to fly (we think it evolved from gills but it might have evolved from the exoskeleton as well).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some live in water, some not, some live in water in the larvea stage and not in their adult stage.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>They have all sorts of diet<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>When flight evolved at first, they had 3 pairs of wings. All extant species (who are descendents of this species that evolved flight) have now lost at least one pair of wings, the one closest to the head.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some species have lost flight.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some species have lost a second pair of wings (<em>diptera<\/em>)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some have evolved crazy mimetism and defense mechanism from the developmental pathway of the third pair of wings.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Eusociality (which is arguably one of the most mind boggling things in evolutionary biology) has evolved several times in insects.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Some species have sex that is determined the ploidy (number of sets of chromosomes) level (it is the case in many eusocial species).<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is the common ancestor between vertebrates, arthropods and molluscs?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can explore the tree of life by yourself on <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/tree/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tolweb.org<\/a>. Arthropods and molluscs are more closely related than any of them are to vertebrates. The MRCA of vertebrates, arthropods and molluscs was a <em>Bilateria<\/em> (animal, eukaryote). You can see this bifurcation <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/Animals/2374\" rel=\"nofollow\">here on tolweb.org<\/a>. I'd recommend to explore a bit this tree of life, it is pretty fun to do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2.

Usual method of working out root patterns on plants is to remove what's known as a monolith, or a block of soil where the plant is - the soil is then either carefully removed by hand, in the manner that archaeologists use, or air blasted, or soaked off in water to reveal as much of the roots as possible. For trees or plants with very large roots, newer methods include geophysical surveying by machine, or electric resistance surveying. Even this doesn't reveal everything - many roots may penetrate too far down, or run along cracks in rocks beneath the soil.

This activates DNA damage repair and also induces signalling towards the melanocytes (which produce the pigment). Signalling means the excretion of signalling molecules (mostly alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone, aMSH) which binds to the MC1R receptor (melanocortin 1 receptor) on the surface of the melanocyte (the cell which produces the pigment) and induces (or increases) the production of melanin. The melanin is then transferred in the melanosomes to the adjacent keratinocytes, which are then better protected from the sun. This figure (from this <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414302\">article<\/a>) illustrates this process nicely:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JFkDo.jpg\" alt=\"diagram of UV effects on the cellular level\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Short term tans (the fast reaction) are based on the changed distribution of melanosomes (granules containing pigment) from the melanocytes to keratinocytes. Longer term suntans are caused by increased pigmentation in the skin as a reaction to the UV exposure by the accumulation of melanin and by the burning of cells. So it is no wonder that it looks like increased pigmentation, it really is. People tan differently because of their genetic background. This influences their ability to react to sun exposure.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is relatively little known about the degradation of the melanosomes (the granules containing the melanin). What is known is that they are degraded in the lysosome, and that the melanin is most likely degraded through oxidation. There happens to be a permanent turnover of the melanosomes, and when the body is producing fewer new melanosomes than are degraded, your skin will get lighter again.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22404235\">Shining light on skin pigmentation: the darker and the brighter side\nof effects of UV radiation.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/4036/fgm9a2k9_pdf.htm\">Melanocyte biology and skin pigmentation.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/4036/agomik2j_pdf.htm\">Melanosome Degradation: Fact or Fiction<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":35716,"question_id":35713,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1435851298},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1435829217,"creation_date":1435828904,"body":"<p>Some additional details on the same lines as Chris' answer:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799903/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coelho et al.<\/a> have studied the short and long term effects of UV on human skin and they report that there are different stages of tanning:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate pigment darkening: happens in a few minutes and persists for some hours.

This happens in all people, the deeper the skin color is, the better is the protection.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is different between people is the amount of pigment they produce, the number of melanocytes is approximately the same. This depends on their genetic backgroud and is influenced by mutations in the pigment production pathway. As this is relatively complex, there are numerous positions which can influence the ability to tan, so I will only name a few.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rate limiting enzyme for the pigmentation is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosinase\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tyrosinase<\/a> which catalyzes the first step of the melanin biosynthesis and oxidizes the amino acid tyrosine into DOPA. Without tyrosinase humans are not able to make any pigment at all which causes albinism. This is pretty drastic and doesn't happen too often. See reference 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other possibilities are mutation in the signalling towards pigmentation, more specifically mutations in the MC1R gene which encodes on of the receptors. These mutations affect the ability to tan and are associated with red hair color, pale skin and freckles (most of the red-haired people carry at least one mutation in their MC1R gene). See reference 2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there are mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which results in an enzyme with a lower processing rate. Because of this, less pigment can be made as the amount of materials is limited. See references 3 and 4.<\/p>\n\n<p>The diversity of the human pigmentation is influenced by all these (and much more) genes.

It is the pragmatics that can be prohibitively challenging. From an (zoo)archaeological point of view, few animals have actually been domesticated, and only recently in our species' history. The dog is an unusual case, perhaps domesticated 14,000 years ago; most domesticated animals only show skeletal changes within the last 10,000 years. Cats, compared to livestock's total dependence on humans, are 'barely' domesticated--they got used to humans while camping out in Egyptian storehouses where all the mice were, perhaps around 4,000 years ago, but even today a fluffy house cat will revert to a feral state if abandoned. <\/p>\n\n<p>Many animals are behaviourally unsuitable for domestication. If an animal is dangerously aggressive, for example, they cannot be penned and isolated--so the many controlled generations it takes to reduce their baseline aggression cannot occur. Humans also tend to co-opt pre-existing social structures in a species, such as becoming the 'alpha' in a dog pack or the head 'ram' of a sheep herd. Species without a hierarchy or herd mentality are difficult to control and keep track of, and so do not lend themselves to human care. <\/p>\n\n<p>You mentioned tigers in your question. Tigers have little to offer people (other than pelts), they're massive/aggressive, and they're jungle loners. You can't raise a herd of tigers; they'll kill each other and the survivor will kill you. That they're carnivores is also challenging, since a carnivore is much more expensive to feed than a bunch of grass-munching sheep. Altogether, there was never a situation in prehistory that would have turned tigers into giant house cats. House cats eat unwanted mice; tigers eat your cattle (and children). The occasional tiger 'pet' won't change that. <\/p>\n\n<p>Domestication, outside of recent experiments (like the Russian foxes mentioned above), has always been a protracted, indirect process. People started interfering with animals that were already useful in some way(s). Dogs offer warmth, hunting aid, defence, transport, and (in a pinch) food. Alligators, tigers, and sharks are not useful enough to make the danger and cost of raising them worthwhile. Even if you did eventually produce a 'human-friendly' shark, there would still be a 'wild' population ready to eat you--and your complacent pet sharks, too!<\/p>\n\n<p>For a very readable explanation, try the chapter on domestication in Jared Diamond's (1997) <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel<\/em>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20293,"question_id":19396,"up_vote_count":9},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a358989c15d27a086a52c6fca13e4ce4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9679,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9679/peter-masiar","reputation":111,"display_name":"Peter Masiar"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11736,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11736/jamesqf","reputation":401,"display_name":"jamesqf"},"score":0,"post_id":35677,"edited":false,"creation_date":1435785919,"comment_id":58524,"body":"There are also two very different kinds of domestication.

One is famous Russian experiment with foxes, another is infamous Hitler's experiment with cows (experiment with bringing back Aurochs, Heck cattle, cows were \"undomesticated\"). There, in controlled environment, true genetic plasticity of behaviour were showed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that as other posters wrote, this is theoretical. In nature and by natural means, domestication was always hindered by immediate usefulness (not even potential future usefulness). Most of domesticated animals are highly social in their natural form and not very aggressive. Even big cats are quite close. Tigers not as much as cheetahs, which were traditionally bred (or kept as pet) from ancient times.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In short, can you theoretically get any animal to have heritable traits?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All animals have heritable traits.

One extreme answer is to say that all things are relative, and that the concepts of local and invasive are all relative.  This matters to a certain extent because we (ecologists) draw a fuzzy line between invasive and naturalized (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1472-4642.2000.00083.x/abstract\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1472-4642.2000.00083.x/abstract<\/a>).  You could start with some basic species that we all think of as either good, local, or neutral.  Take the earthworm.  Most people think of it as a common native species, but it's actually an invasive species that has radically changed much of North America that came over with the Europeans (<a href=\"http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/terrestrialanimals/earthworms/index.html\">http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/terrestrialanimals/earthworms/index.html<\/a>).  Similarly, brown trout are also invasive, coming to the US in the 1800's (<a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/fish/resources/WildTrout/WT_BrownDesc.asp\">http://www.dfg.ca.gov/fish/resources/WildTrout/WT_BrownDesc.asp<\/a>).  <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as why invasive species succeed, it's still an open question.  What you reference is the enemy release hypothesis, but there are others such as disturbance, diversity of the new community, and just the traits.  Here's a good review: <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.431/abstract\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.431/abstract<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01418.x/full\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01418.x/full<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>To answer your question about adapting, I wouldn't trust your memory. It's important to keep in mind that most likely your memory is flawed, and you are only observing a very limited number samples with an incomplete sampling methodology.  For instance gypsy moths undergo wild population fluctuations, and have for over 100 years. (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00012004\">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00012004<\/a>).  How well do ecosystems bounce back from invasions depends on lots of factors.  Often time the ecosystem can survive, but the some species won't.  An easy example would be Norther Hardwood forests.  Chestnuts (extirpated by an invasive fungus)are mostly gone from the wild, but the forest persists, as well as many of the species that rely on them.  So in part the answer to your question depends on scale.  The forest survived, but an individual species was nearly destroyed.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Ecological economists have tried to put a value on the destruction that invasive species have caused too (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800904003027\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800904003027<\/a>).  <\/p>\n","answer_id":15143,"question_id":10140,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10140/do-invasive-species-cause-long-term-damage-to-ecosystems-they-invade","last_activity_date":1435781900,"creation_date":1377879899,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do invasive species cause long-term damage to ecosystems they invade?","body":"<p>Growing up in the U.S., I was warned at various times of the dire consequences of a variety of introduced pests (usually insects).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_beetle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japanese beetles<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_moth\" rel=\"nofollow\">gypsy moths<\/a>, and most recently the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_marmorated_stink_bug\" rel=\"nofollow\">brown marmorated stink bug<\/a> are all introduced pests that, at various times, were described as serious threats to our ecology.<\/p>\n\n<p>These threats aren't confined to arthropods, either.

This is due to some key factors:<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, the philogenetic distance between plants and animals is huge. Diseases transmitted by the consumption of animals are called zoonosis, and obviously it is more likely to catch a zoonosis by eating pork than eating shrimps or clams. While it's true that certain parasites have different hosts and use them to transmit themselves (for instance, many platyhelmintha uses mollusks or insects to spread themselves towards mammalian or avian hosts) parasites than have only one kind of host usually are adapted to live inside them, and they usually are unable to infect different organisms. Very few parasites can infect a human and a starfish, and even fewer can infect at the same time a human and a tomato plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, and related to the first, plant physiology differs completely from animal physiology. Plants usually defend themselves by their natural barriers (cuticles, cell walls), hypersensitive response (programmed cell death in order to limit the spread of a pathogen), isolation and/or outgrowing of the pathogen and accumulation of chemicals. Animals main mechanism is immune system. There are very different strategies and very few organisms can effectively avoid all of them at the same time. In the case of viruses, they would even have to face the fact that animals and plants have huge genetic differences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Third even if they could, the pathogen will face competition against other pathogens that would be more specialized. Bacteria and fungi can be really hostile towards their microfoes, using a wide array of strategies. This hypothetical pathogen would be very unspecific, so they would have a hard time against more focused microbes. It should be noted, however, that unspecialized organisms usually have a great advantage if the environment have some perturbation, and they also are more resilient toward stress. Many plant pathogens are generalistic organisms that attacks when the plant is harmed or stressed. The same applies to many opportunistic infections in animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite all of this, there are some diseases that should be mentioned. Some fungi of the <em>Clavyceps<\/em> genera are plan pathogens, but they produce toxins than can affect the nervous system of animals, causing an intoxication called ergotism (the most famous of this chemicals is the lisergic acid, also known as LSD). Other fungi can produce toxins while they grow in plant tissue. Moreover, there are many fungi that can grow both in plant tissue and as animal parasites (mainly arthropods and nematodes), but in this case the plant pathogenesis usually occurs only when high fungal concentration is achieved or the plant is already damaged. While it's not a real infection, plant pathogens can cause allergic reactions. Finally, phytopathogenic fungi and some bacteria can cause infections in wounds or mucoses in individuals with a compromised immune system, but in this case the source seems to be the spores in the air.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9872,"question_id":9870,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1435695085},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUToS.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3971,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3971/atl-led","reputation":3371,"display_name":"Atl LED","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1377035438,"creation_date":1377030360,"body":"<p>I think a main problem here is limiting logic.  <\/p>\n\n<p>By eliminating both toxic/poisonous plants, plants that have evolved to discourage you from eating them, and improperly \"washed\" plants, things which contain non-plant mater that can make you sick, you are not left with the possibility of diseases. <\/p>\n\n<p>BSE is caused by prions, which are mater of serious debate and research in academics at the moment.  The leading cause of transmission is likely ingestion (1, 2), but it is quite possible that it arises as a mutation sporadically in certain mammals (3).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Coming back to your question, let's suppose two scenarios:<\/h2>\n\n<p>First let's suppose that a prion, or really any other pathogen, were to fall onto a piece a fruit from another mammal.  If you, or a cow, were to eat it in this unclean state you have the chance to develop disease.  But we would not eat the plant in this unclean state because we are to have it properly washed.  The same is true for pathogenic microorganisms that are naturally occurring on plants.  I think you addressed this well in the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>But let us propose another situation where a plant evolves a new protein, or a new form of a protein as is the case in the prion.  For simplicity let's call this protein \"X.\"  X may or may not be toxic to the plant, and cause disease in the plant.  If it does, it would likely have selective pressure against the population it was in (even if it was infectious to plants like a prion).  But we may not, at least in the beginning be able to tell if the plant has the protein in it, so we go ahead and eat it (and for the sake of argument, we won't cook it, which is bad news for all kinds of pathogens).<\/p>\n\n<p>If that protein causes sickness in an animal (like humans) we would say that it is toxic, and we would exclude it per your preamble.  If it is stable enough, it would remain toxic in our bodies, and should anyone be unfortunate enough to eat us or roll around in are carcass, there would be a small but theoretical chance they could get sick as well.  Again it would likely be excluded from this question as a toxin.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think these get at what you are asking, but I think there is a spirit of what you are asking which goes further:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why aren't contagious agents produced by plants?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Miguel addresses the problem quite nicely.  First, the genetic distance between humans and plants is so vast that a prion-like protein developing is highly unlikely.  Second, plants themselves are unlikely to make good pathogens.  Finally, natural selection has favored the production of toxins and irritants when plants have sought chemical means to deter animals (as opposed to a physical deterrent like a thorn).<\/p>\n\n<p>Prions work because of shared/similar proteins existing within species.  A similarly shared protein that we would had with plants would probably be so basic that it was shared by the vast majority of eukaryotes, and if it existed, would likely be capable of destroying a good deal of life, including the plant itself.  Thankfully most of the very basic proteins we make a well regulated, and have mechanisms in place to \u201cthrow away\u201d miss folded questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we move past the genetic distance, and ignore the conditions that would be needed to select for plant being pathogens, let\u2019s look at other obstacles plants would face.  Plants aren\u2019t very good at locomotion, so it would need to get on us by direct contact, carried to us from the elements, or by some other animal.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good case example would be C. immitis, a fungus.  It needs the spores to be kicked up and inhaled by an individual who is in some way compromised (normally).  Once this happens, it can begin the next hard step which is to grow.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The immune system of a healthy individual would definitely recognize any fungal or plant matter as foreign object and try to get rid of it.  Also note that a pathogenic plant would be limited in size by our behavior.  I think even a sloth would not allow a flower or tree to grow out of its back or arm.  Anything big enough would cause itching and/or illicit a behavioral effort to physically remove it.  Many microbial infections do cause itching, which if you are larger than a microbe, is a good way to have your whole body scratched off your host.<\/p>\n\n<p>But let\u2019s assume that our pathogen has made it on a human, found a place where it can grow, found enough food to live there (presumably us), has matched our immune system, is small enough that we haven\u2019t been able to physically remove it (think algae), and/or made it to an internal part of body like our lungs where we have a harder time getting rid of it.  After doing all that, it has to grow to the point where it can get back out of bodies, and then back into another human and start over.  A prion-like pathogen would also have to replicate to significant enough numbers to be transmitted host to host.  Transmission is a very difficult process, and as Miguel points out, normally requires a good deal of species dependent specialization and adaption<\/p>\n\n<h2>In summary:<\/h2>\n\n<p>I have hard time imaging how a plant, even a small one like alga, could undergo enough selective pressure to become an infectious agent.  It would be further complicated by that fact that you were eating it in your question, which means it would have to contend with the GI track.  The genetic distance makes a prion like pathogen highly improbable if not outright impossible.  Toxins, however, are in great abundance in the plant world, and seem to be a good way to get animals to leave you alone.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I think about plant toxins, I always like to think of the Sumac family.  Cashews evolved to be delicious and were cultivated for it, poison ivy evolved to be painful and is destroyed for it, and when we think of the family, we always think of the pain first.

For example, olfactory receptors are clustered in the nasal region, while gustatory receptors are scattered in the head region and beyond. In turn, olfactory information is sent via a single cranial nerve to the brain, while the gustatory system includes three cranial nerves.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10982/\" rel=\"nofollow\">olfactory<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403_supp/full/486S2a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">gustatory system<\/a> both receive their inputs through chemoreceptor cells. The chemoreceptor proteins in both systems are G-protein coupled receptor systems. However, the olfactory and gustatory systems are anatomically separated. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>olfactory end organ<\/strong> is in fish comparable to that in humans, namely sensory epithelia situated in nostrils. The olfactory receptor cells form axons that are grouped into the <strong><em>olfactory nerve<\/em><\/strong> (cranial nerve I). The nerve innervates the olfactory bulb, where its axons synapse onto mitral cells. Mitral cell axons group into the olfactory tract that projects to the telencephalon in the brain.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmadl.jpg\" alt=\"fish\"><br>\n<sup>Schematic of olfactory system of a fish (not all structures shown).

The taste buds can be found in various structures including gills, barbels, fins, oral cavity and pharynx, dependent on the species. Unlike the olfactory system, gustatory information is transmitted to the brain via three separate cranial nerves: <strong><em>facial<\/em><\/strong> (cranial nerve VII), <strong><em>glossopharyngeal<\/em><\/strong> (cranial nerve IX) and <strong><em>vagal nerve<\/em><\/strong> (cranial nerve x). Normally, the facial nerve innervates taste buds on the extraoral surface, the glossopharyngeal on the anterior part of the oral cavity, and the vagal nerve on the pharynx. The facial and vagal nerves respectively terminate in the facial and vagal lobes in the medulla. The glossopharyngeal nerve terminates in a dorsal medullary region between the facial and vagal lobes.\n<br><br><br> \n<strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00043259\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hara, <em>Rev Fish Biol Fisheries<\/em> (1994); <strong>4<\/strong>: 1-35<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":35650,"question_id":34733,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1435655597}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34733/how-are-smell-and-taste-in-fish-differentiated","last_activity_date":1435655597,"creation_date":1433010378,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are smell and taste in fish differentiated?","body":"<p>The senses of <em>taste<\/em> and <em>smell<\/em> in different fish classes are described as two distinct senses; smell is mediated by the nasal openings, and taste by epithelial taste buds.<\/p>\n\n<p>They are both forms of chemoreception and therefore it is not clear to me what intrinsically defines them as two distinct senses.

I was torn as to where I should post this question: it could plausibly belong in Biology, User Experience or even Arqade.  However, given the root of my question has to do with the \"wiring\" of the human hand, I elected to post it here.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>My hypothesis/question:<\/strong><br>\nLet's assume that wrist adduction/abduction is responsible for horizontal movement of the mouse cursor and that finger extension/flexion is responsible for vertical movement of the mouse cursor.  (I am, of course, willing to revisit this assumption, if necessary.)  Would it be accurate to say that we are \"hard-wired\" to be capable of higher precision in vertical movement of the mouse cursor than in horizontal movement?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Description of mouse grip:<\/strong><br>\nIn making the above assumptions, I assume a fingertip-grip style of the mouse (as opposed to the claw and palm grips). The (corner of the) wrist rests on the table and acts as a pivot for allowing side-to-side motion (i.e., horizontal motion of the mouse cursor).  Meanwhile, flexing/extending the fingers allows for pulling/pushing the mouse away from us, (i.e., vertical motion of the cursor).  The main (admittedly unscientific) reason behind my hypothesis is that vertical movement of the mouse cursor uses similar finger motions as those used for hand-writing (which is, after all, a highly precise activity).  <\/p>\n\n<p>(I understand that my question makes the assumption that we are capable of more precise movement with certain muscles of our body than we are with others - please let me know if that's a flawed assumption.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do I care about this?:<\/strong><br>\nIf my hypothesis is correct, there would be implications on mouse settings (namely, horizontal and vertical DPI*) that are conducive to both high accuracy and speed.  The key issue is that if we keep our wrist in place (i.e., no sliding/lifting of our pivot point) - then we're able to move the mouse a greater distance side-to-side (i.e., horizontal motion of cursor) than we're able to move it toward/away from us (i.e., vertical motion of cursor).  However, if there is evidence to support my hypothesis, than an appropriate adjustment (which wouldn't result in a loss of accuracy) would be to have a slightly higher vertical DPI than horizontal DPI.<\/p>\n\n<p>*DPI = dots (i.e., pixels per inch).  For example, I have a resolution of 1366x768 (which is in units of dots or pixels) and a 600 dpi mouse, which means that my (physical) mouse needs to be moved ~2.3 inches (1366 divided by 600) in order for the mouse cursor to move the full horizontal distance of my monitor.  To put it simply, lower DPI results in higher accuracy but it is preferable for our wrist to remain in-place in the interest of speed.<\/p>\n","question_id":35620,"tags":["human-anatomy","movement"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":35631,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":125,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4b291b8d429dc2d50693fe212127590?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9207,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9207/vladimir-gritsenko","reputation":158,"display_name":"Vladimir Gritsenko"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":8,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd029d7f94e0d8161c65ba1a9a6548cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6845,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6845/pbond","reputation":175,"display_name":"pbond"},"score":0,"post_id":35643,"edited":false,"creation_date":1447181707,"comment_id":68149,"body":"They also bind to albumin."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1435601787,"creation_date":1435601787,"body":"<p>Steroid hormones are transported in an inactive form bound to proteins in the bloodstream.

Only about 9% of whites and 16% of blacks engage in interracial marriage in the U.S.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But really this deserves a fuller discussion.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The predominant pattern of mate selection in human beings is to <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~neilm/Political%20Ideology%20and%20Racial%20Preferences%20in%20Online%20Dating.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">marry within their ethnic group<\/a>.  I say 'ethnic group' rather than 'race' because 'race' has no strong scientific definition. Racial groups as usually understood have about the same <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic variance as the overall species<\/a>.  I need to point out here that races can have a strong geographical point of origin and thus races can in some cases be genetically identified, but these correlate poorly often with, say health risks or other clinical data. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because its clear that interracial marriages are on the rise in the US, mating choices are often argued to be socially defined preferences.  Social attitudes affect men and women differently and different cultures too, as tracked by regional differences. Not the least is a limit of opportunities.  Being comfortable with people from other cultures or who simply look different. <\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Women at least in American studies are much more likely to <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~neilm/Political%20Ideology%20and%20Racial%20Preferences%20in%20Online%20Dating.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">state a same-race preference<\/a> (see p17), while men are likely to demur from stating a preference, but act out a bias unconsciously, making both genders equally biased. <\/p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments by @AliceD, Mating preferences as described in traditional population biology are adapted from availability.  That's to say people don't meet because of ethnic boundaries such as geography, socioeconomic or social strata. Then there are socialized preferences.  I.e. growing up we are imprinted by the sorts of people we see, which can create preferences later in life.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly there may be genetically conveyed preferences. The human race has been spreading out over the past 200,000 years or so.  That's a pretty small amount of time.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are cases where such mating preferences have evolved.  There are 17 species of arctic penguins, species caused by migration around the globe.  Each species can actually mate with others nearby, but where the penguins met at the far end of the globe, the species do not mate because they have been separated for so long they have diverged.  <\/p>\n\n<p>But speciation events can take millions of years.  Its clear that human beings from the far corners of the globe can produce offspring - we are one species.  It seems as if we are only a fraction of the way towards two neighboring penguin species in the example above.  There doesn't seem to be any evidence that we are genetically predisposed to ethinic self mating.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Only by way of example (not to offend anyone!) you can choose an ethnic group which has divergent behavior and try to get an estimate of how big a role the social context plays.  Looking at the jewish community we see that <a href=\"http://www.interfaithfamily.com/news_and_opinion/synagogues_and_the_jewish_community/Jewish_Intermarriage_Statistics.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">47% of jewish people have married out of group<\/a> in recent statistics.  They are thinly distributed over a wide geographical region and availability is high for out-group marriage.  All this while orthodox jews have a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/17/eight-facts-about-orthodox-jews-from-the-pew-research-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow\">practically non-existent out-group marriage rate<\/a>. Not judging here, but only for illustrative purposes we can guess that social attitudes and behaviors are playing a large role here.<\/p>\n\n<p>As and endnote, I'd also like to point out that since whites are about 50% of the US population and african americans are about 10%, the percentages not so disparate as they seem - all things being equal the average person one meets in the US is white.

In chemistry, thermodynamically favorable reactions ($\\Delta G &lt; 0$) are indeed termed spontaneous because they will <em>eventually<\/em> occur, regardless of how slowly. But if transition states are unfavorable (high energy barrier), the reaction rate can be extremely slow --- millions of years in some cases. For example, combustion of wood is highly favorable and, chemically speaking, it is spontaneous. But that doesn't mean trees are unstable and likely to catch fire any minute.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most biologists would probably call a reaction \"spontaneous\" only if it actually happens on a reasonable time scale, perhaps on the order of hours, depending on the context. So the terminology is a bit messy. But neither chemists nor biologists would call a molecule \"unstable\" if it has a reasonable half-life, I think. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now for the actual questions. Dephosphorylations are typically not ATP-driven, because breaking the P-O bonds is usually favorable already (although I'm sure there exceptions). However, the reaction is typically too slow to be useful to cells, so it is not \"spontaneous\" in this sense, and therefore needs to be catalyzed by phosphatases. A typical example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase\" rel=\"nofollow\">alkaline phosphatase<\/a> which dephosphorylates a wide range of proteins and other substrates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Phosphorylation requires a phosphate source of course, but also an energy source, because forming P-O bonds is not a favorable reaction on its own (the reverse of the above). So adding a lone phosphate would not be favorable, but transfering one from ATP is much better, because this simultaneously involves breaking a P-O bond in ATP, \"freeing up\" energy to drive the reaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, an interesting point is that ATP itself is actually a quite stable molecule, with a <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00902a030\" rel=\"nofollow\">half-life of about two weeks<\/a>. So ATP hydrolysis is not \"spontaneous\" in the biologist's sense, and enzyme catalysis is required (kinases). In fact, the combination of a high \"energy content\" and good stability is probably key to the role of ATP as an energy currency in cells: if ATP was indeed unstable, it would randomly phosphorylate everything. Stability means enzyme catalysis can be used to control phosphorylation events. Truly unstable compounds are never used by cells, because their reactivity causes damage and toxicity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35611,"question_id":35604,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35604/phosphorylation-dephosphorylation-atp-driven-vs-spontaneous","last_activity_date":1435532094,"creation_date":1435512668,"answer_count":1,"title":"Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation : ATP-driven VS spontaneous","body":"<p>Is protein <strong>dephosphorylation<\/strong> most commonly spontaneous (without need of ATP)?

Self-incompatibility has been lost many times in the history of flowering plants, yielding self-compatibility (SC), which allows a plant to breed with itself. A plant that can breed with itself has an advantage in that even if the population size is low and it can't 'find' another individual to breed with, it can still breed with itself to produce offspring. However, this trait is expected to result in decreased genetic diversity in the offspring due to inbreeding.<\/p>\n\n<p>The transition from SI to SC is a common transition that cannot easily be reversed. One might expect, then, that SI would be very uncommon as lineages would lose it to SC. However, it turns out that SC lineages have a lower diversification rate than SI plants in the Solanaceae due to the fact that SC lineages have a higher extinction rate than speciation rate. This difference in diversification allows SI to persist. This is an example of trait-dependent net diversification rate. It is not known exactly why SI lineages have a higher net diversification rate, but it could be related to the higher effective population size which results in \"increased polymorphism,\nlower linkage disequilibrium, more\nefficient response to purifying selection, more\nextensive geographic distribution of genetic diversity,\nand lower rates of extinction\".<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more, I can suggest a few more papers:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2096764\">The Units of Selection<\/a> by R.C.

So perhaps over time the surviving taxa are those that have evolved mechanims to \"hedge their bets\" against future environmental changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's clear that some of the parameters that affect genetic diversity within a species (e.g. mate selection, mutation rate) are heritable, but it's unclear to me how the short-term processes of natural selection relate to the extremely long-term processes of speciation and extinction.

The basic idea is that the human immune system is developed by exposture to the microbiota, and without exposture to organisms from our evolutionary past, immune system regulation might fail. This can then lead to poorly regulated inflammatory responses and \nmaybe allergies or other chronic inflammatory diseases. Since the exposture to our evolutionary <em>Old friends<\/em> is lower in developed countries and urban areas, this hypothesis might potentially (partially) explain the increased prevalence of allergies in developed countries. Even though it is somewhat tangential to your question, and does not directly answer the question of the pros and cons of antibacterial soap, it should still be relevant for a more general case.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two good starting points are <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/46/18360\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rook (2013)<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8334\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hanski et al (2012)<\/a>. Rook (2013) is a general overview of the theory with many good references to empirical studies that relate to the hypothesis, by one of the main proponents of the theory. Hanski et al (2012) is an interesting epidemiological paper, where they relate the allergic disposition of individuals to both the general biodiversity in their larger living environment as well as the generic diversity of their skin microbiota. In the paper, they find a positive relationship in healthy individuals between immune responses and the abundance of the gammaproteobacterial genus Acinetobacter on the skin, but they do not find the same pattern in atopic individuals. The study also finds a negative relationship between the environmental biodiversity close to the homes of study subjects and the frequency of atopy (so high biodiversity -> lower levels of atopy).<\/p>\n\n<p>To be clear, this is still a hypothesis that needs further testing and support. However, there are many interesting case studies that can lend support to it, and indicate plausible mechanisms.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/46/18360\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rook. 2013. <em>Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: An ecosystem service essential to health<\/em>.

As you can see in the image, the human reference DNA is found at the top of the window. Then each of the gray bars that you see below that is an individual sequencing read that matches to that particular location along the human DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you use a variant caller like <a href=\"https://github.com/ekg/freebayes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freebayes<\/a>, it will list out information about locations along the reference genome that had differences in your actual sequences. For instance, as you bring up, DP or read depth. Looking back at the IGV image, you can see a location that had a lot of 'G' showing in the sequence reads, where the reference DNA has 'A'. Variant callers will pick up on this and list it as a possible variant. They will also tell you the read depth at that location which is the total number of sequence reads overlapping that position. In this case there are 21 gray bars (sequence reads) overlapping at that position, meaning that DP=21.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though it is not listed in the VCF example to which you refer, variant callers can also give other data like AO, which is times that a variant was observed, and RO which is the number of times the reference base was observed. This information allows you to decide whether or not an identified variant was a sequencing error, or a real variant.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance if DP=1, AO=1, RO=0, that means there was only a single read at that location and it was not what is listed in the reference genome. Because the depth is so low, and the error rate of a next-gen sequencer is somewhere between 0.5-5%, you cannot say that this is a mutation or just a sequencing error. However, as DP increases, you gain more confidence in whatever was called. So if DP=10, AO=10, RO=0 you can be quite confident that the reason you read an alternate base at a given location, it is not just a sequencing error because you read this location 10 times and every time you saw the same variant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know if I can clarify further.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35577,"question_id":35478,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35478/whats-read-depth-in-vcf","last_activity_date":1435421324,"creation_date":1435112761,"answer_count":2,"title":"What's read depth in VCF?","body":"<p>There is an attribute defined as DP (Total Depth) in VCF file format.

The bag labelled GB does not have any M balls (0), and has 50 G and 50 B balls. And so on. This gives us for each bag the probabilities defined in @Remi.b\u2019s response.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although there are many bags in our particular case we only care about the MM bag, so we should only consider those probabilities. Imagine now you pick five balls at random from this (the MM) bag. What is the probability that you will get $m=1$, $g=3$ and $b=1$ (with <em>m<\/em>, <em>g<\/em> and <em>b<\/em> representing the number of M, G and B balls respectively)? Because there are three types of balls (or categories) this is described by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">multinomial distribution<\/a> (and not the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">binomial<\/a>, which describes events involving two categories, like the flip of a coin). The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution#Probability_mass_function\" rel=\"nofollow\">multinomial probability mass function<\/a> is defined in this problem as:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ Pr(M=m,G=g,B=b) = \\frac{n!}{m!g!b!} p_M^{m} p_G^{g} p_B^b\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Where $P_i$ are the probabilities described above, n is the total number of childs, and m, g, and b are the number of childs with M, G and B eye color respectively. Therefore, for our family we have the following computation:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\nPr(M=1,G=1,B=3) = \\frac{5!}{1!1!3!}(0.75)^1(0.1875)^1(0.0625)^3 = 0.000686643\n$$<\/p>\n\n<p>The probability (~0.07%) looks very low, but it is basically about 7 out of 10,000 families with parents having both brown eyes and 5 children. Given the large human population it is difficult but not impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, I knew a family where the parents had both brown eyes and the two children had blue eyes. Always wondered about it but this is the first time I actually tried to think about the probabilities! In this case the probability would be 0.00390625 (~0.4%).<\/p>\n\n<p>BTW, you can easily compute the same in <a href=\"http://www.r-project.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">R<\/a> with the following code:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; dmultinom(c(1,1,3), 5, c(.75, .1875, .0625))\n[1] 0.0006866455\n&gt; dmultinom(c(0,0,2), 2, c(.75, .1875, .0625))\n[1] 0.00390625\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","answer_id":35572,"question_id":35515,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35515/how-is-it-possible-for-only-one-in-five-children-to-have-brown-eyes-when-their-p","last_activity_date":1435418051,"creation_date":1435258792,"answer_count":2,"title":"How is it possible for only one in five children to have brown eyes when their parents both have brown eyes?","body":"<p>I have observed that parents having brown eyes had three female offspring with blue eyes, one son with green eyes, while only the youngest daughter had brown eyes. <\/p>\n\n<p>How can they produce so many blue-eyed offspring?<\/p>\n","question_id":35515,"tags":["genetics"],"score":8,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":354,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1435411219},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/353a8ead76febf7aec24d8f90cdc56b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16444,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16444/anthony-damico","reputation":106,"display_name":"Anthony Damico"},"closed_date":1435387217,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":3,"post_id":35567,"edited":false,"creation_date":1435380577,"comment_id":58065,"body":"1) Assembling and annotating genomes isn&#39;t as trivial sequencing the DNA (which in itself isn&#39;t exactly trivial). 2) There already exist a vast amount of sequence data, all of which is publicly available.
