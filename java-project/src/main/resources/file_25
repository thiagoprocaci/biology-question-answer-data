If you have a XX chromosome pair you are female. If you have a XY pair you are male. Therefore the Y-Chromosome get only passed on from father to son. The Chromosomes itself consist of DNA. The DNA consists of base pairs in which an A only pairs with a T and a C only pairs with a G. The Y-Chromosome has about 57 million of these base pairs. DNA is normally relative stable but from time to time only one of these base pairs randomly changes from a C-G base pair to an A-T base pair. This phenomenon is called a pointmutation. So imagen two brothers. One has the unchanged Y-Chromosome of their father the other has one this pointmutations. So the descendants of the one Brother have the same Y-Chromosome, with exception of the pointmutation, the same Y-Chromosome. This is called a Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). In the millennia the Y-Chromosomes acquire more and more of these SNPs. One combination of these SNPs is called a Haplogroup. By the amount of SNPs and the kind of them you can reconstruct which Haplogroup descended from which one. You have the Haplogroup R-M512 which is a rather old one (<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/R1a._Info-19.05.2014.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/R1a._Info-19.05.2014.jpg<\/a>) and could be found in great area.

Likewise with, Retinal, Retinol but not with Retinoic Acid (irreversibly metabolized/end point) however, i'm assuming that these first generation Retinoids are produced via ex situ (a facility) metabolism and hence, they do not contain the carotenoid component that cause yellowing of the skin due to the absence of lipid soluble orange/yellow pigments (Xanthaemia). Albeit, the color of the aforementioned FG retinoids when in a concentrated solid state are all yellow still due to molecular structure - explained in midsection.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For example:<\/strong><br>\n<strong>Retinal:<\/strong>  Otherwise known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Retinaldehyde<\/a>, is ingested via <strong>meat<\/strong> (as a single/complete molecule) or produced by ingestion of <strong>carotenoid<\/strong> containing food-stuff (e.g. carots). The pigment causing the color are, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Carotenes<\/em><\/a>. Carotene is a component of the Carotenoid molecule; α-carotene and β-carotene.<br>\nAlternatively, Retinal can be produced from the metabolism of β-cryptoxanthin, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthophyll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xanthophyll<\/a> containing compound. Xanthophyll and Carotene are similar in terms of molecular structure, however, a Xanthophyll molecule contains <a href=\"http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/IGOC/H/hydroxyl_group.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydroxyl groups<\/a> and hence, Oxygen atoms - Carotenes are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon\" rel=\"nofollow\">hydrocarbons<\/a>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>On that note, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">hypervitaminosis A<\/a> <strong>can<\/strong> be caused by an over ingestion of α-carotene and β-carotene sources e.g. Carrots, due to the process of metabolism; over an extended period of time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally;<br>\nRetinyl ester &lt;=> Retinol &lt;=>  Retinal => Retinoic acid<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>What causes <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/xanthemia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xanthemia<\/a> in this context?<\/h2>\n\n<p>α-carotene and β-carotene, are absorbed via (passive) diffusion within the gastrointestinal tract. From there, they are metabolized (not fully/partially) at the the mucousal layer of the intestine for the substance to be transported into the liver. Next, the metabolite is diffused into the peripheral tissues by the blood plasma. This is were the \"issue\" is: Excretion. Carotenoids are <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104368-overview#a2\" rel=\"nofollow\">excreted via<\/a> bowel movements (gastrointestinal secretions), Urination, through the secretion of sebum and by <strong>sweating<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>If very high levels of Carotenoids are being ingested, the pigment tends to show itself when a \"build up\" occurs, in the sweet glands of our dermis and more noticeably, in areas of which there are a large amount of sweat glands e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolabial_fold\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasolabial folds<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The orange color is defined is due to the classification of what Carotenoids are. <strong>All<\/strong> carotenoids are <a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/class/terp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>tetraterpenoids<\/em><\/a>: essentially being <a href=\"http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/425/lecture26.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tetraterpenes<\/a> that have been modified by chemical transformations such as oxidation or cyclization. Furtherly, tetraterpenoids are made up 40 carbon atoms and contain 8 isoprene molecules. α-carotene and β-carotene, are bicylcic tetraterpenoids. This molecular classification <em>may<\/em> have an affect on the amount of energy that the molecule can absorb, and more formally, the colour. Albeit, the greatest majority of reasoning in regards to the orange color, is in favor of the long <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">conjugated<\/a> chain'ed structure of the molecule.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carotenoids absorb light in the <a href=\"https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/photosynthesis-8/the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis-81/absorption-of-light-375-11601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blue-green and violet region<\/a> and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths; these pigments also dispose excess energy out of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p>Retinal and Retinal are preformed retinoids and are not obtained by means of carotenoid metabolism so, they won't contain the the yellow/orange dark pigment that is found within some plant-based food (Carotene). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Retinoic Acid<\/a>, is a retinoid although it's function is as a cell signalling molecule. The difference between it and the other retinoids is the functional group present of the tail of the carbon-carbon backbone<\/p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, speaking, and due to retinoids having a shorter/less extended  conjugated system with less unsaturated (multiple) bonds in the molecules it will have shifted the absorption to shorter wavelengths (The two carotene precursors have 11 conjugated bonds and the latter retinoids contain 5).<\/p>\n\n<p>Furtherly, I don't think that the carboxyl group attached to the Retinoic acid molecule could be classed as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxochrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auxochrome<\/a> although the remainder of the retinoic acids carbon-carbon chain is still the molecules <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chromophore<\/a> - likewise with the other retinoids.  For example, this would mean that there is possibility that the retinoic acid molecule will be more inclined to absorb shorter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength\" rel=\"nofollow\">wavelengths<\/a> and hence, less orange/yellow. This is relevant as, you will often find retinoic acid in topical preparations that are used to treat certain dermatological conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think that there <em>is<\/em> a 100% correct answer for this question as there is no evidence to prove that it would be true in this particular case.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you are susceptible to toxicity at lower levels in regards to retinol, retinal and retinoic acid because, of the fact that they are metabolites/concentrates and you need ingest less in order to get to the same point of toxicity. Carotenoids are \"raw\" in contrast to the preformed retinoids   and require breakdown.

Associations like this are dangerous in the sense that we shouldn't think that one causes the other. But, we can speculate on how they are linked, which is always fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll be going off my understanding of cholesterol transport and will include the reference at the bottom. Essentially, cholesterol is used in the cell membrane to change the permeability of the membrane. The more cholesterol, the less permeable the membrane is to water. However, this also changes the physical properties of the cell membrane, making it more rigid and structured. If I had to guess (which is again PURE SPECULATION) I would think that decreasing the cholesterol to the point of a dangerous level would increase the cell permeability of vital cells, the most sensitive would be neurons who depend on ion based signaling to perform primary functions. Since ions are very small and easily pass through the membrane if the membrane is leaky, they might be the first indicator that the something is wrong and the membrane isn't strong enough. Again, purely speculative with no evidence. An experiment one could do is examine the amount of cholesterol required in a cell to keep ions from crossing the membrane and see if there are any other effects that occur within or around the cell before ion passing.

This method of electric pulse transfer has been evolutionary updated, essentially, but we can get an idea of how these cells came to be. If we look back at squid predecessors, like the jellyfish, we see that it also developed electrical impulse cells to aide in defense and movement. Back further, we see the sponge has no neurons, but has something similar. This gives us potential insight into the development of the cell. It has protein clusters that act similar to post-synaptic signaling. So it is likely the electrical impulses were developed based on the function of these protein clusters, and bam!

The muscles that move your eyes are voluntary. You control them, but think about how you usually command them. Whether sudden and reactive or careful and deliberate, you think about where you want to be looking and make your eyes look there. There is no functional purpose in looking without seeing, and seeing involves tracking specific features, focusing. It requires quick movement between multiple points of focus to gain information efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the movement of your fingers. That movement can be smooth and fluid even though multiple muscle groups have to work together to make it happen. When you command the movement of your finger, you have a body-map that gives you a detailed idea of where your finger is, and how it is connected to you. You can be aware of its location with reasonable precision even if you can't see it. When it is necessary to move it with smooth, fluid motion, your muscle movement is guided by your internal body-map, and usually your eyes, confirming the motion. In contrast, you have very little concept of the actual position of your eyes within their socket, probably because it's not generally very useful information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Positioning your eyes precisely, independent of what they are looking at is actually counter-productive. Doing so costs you the ability to see, as you can demonstrate to yourself by crossing your eyes, which, incidentally, is probably your best chance at achieving the sort of smooth movement you are referring to.<\/p>\n\n<p>Probably the most significant reason you can't move your eyes smoothly is what you have practiced consistently for most of your life. With your motor muscles, countless various activities have required some degree of precise, smooth movement. During those very activities, what are your eyes doing? They are only moving smoothly if they are focused on a single point in motion - either a point on your body, or a point on an object which you are moving. Otherwise, they are bouncing from point to point, gathering information to measure whether your muscles need to adjust to accomplish the smooth movement you are attempting.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you were born, your motor muscles were not proficient with smooth action either. Think about how a newborn baby jerks their limbs around, sometimes even clobbering themselves with their own hands, and then getting upset about being hit. As a toddler grows toward primary school age, they gradually learn to control muscle movement, but still have trouble when a situation demands very precise movement. Practice, for years, is what ultimately brings graceful movement. But no one ever naturally practices graceful eye motions (not independent of focusing on an object), because such movements are not useful for seeing.<\/p>\n\n<h2>References:<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Body Map Concept:<\/strong> This concept is something you can demonstrate to yourself by moving around in the dark or by performing a task that you cannot see directly, like writing or typing, with your hands hidden from view. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101788221\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is a fascinating RadioLab discussion on phantom limbs which relates closely to this concept.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Motor and Eye movement:<\/strong> The Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye%E2%80%93hand_coordination\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eye-Hand Coordination<\/a> provides some context around the way eye and motor movement correlate.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Childhood development:<\/strong> Smooth pursuit is an acquired skill early in life <a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S004269899600332X/1-s2.0-S004269899600332X-main.pdf?_tid=e6d07980-9ac2-11e5-bfff-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1449259939_0b0fdf1b3997120de484f761078f5f0a\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Van Hofsten &amp; Rosander, 1997)<\/a>, which I can back up with personal observations of my 3 boys growing up. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Smooth Eye Movement:<\/strong> I have verified every statement I've made on this topic via personal experiment. I can move my eyes between more and less cross-eyed quite smoothly, which demonstrates that the muscles in the eye are entirely capable of smooth movement on command. It is clear as I do this, however, that not being able to focus on objects while crossing my eyes is an important part of the process. Otherwise, the instinct to focus on something and see it clearly overcomes my ability to control the movement. I have also learned to move one eye at a time from left to right - again, beginning in a cross-eyed state. This is not nearly as smooth, but the practice contributes to my understanding of the nature of voluntary movement of the eyes. Observation of the blind also contributes to conclusions in this area.

First, do you want to estimate the mean and variance for a statistical population (i.e. to characterize a larger population by independent samples), or do you want to calculate the actual density for a particular area, where you have counted all occurences in that entire area (but maybe divided the area into subareas out of convenience when counting)? This is not clear from your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the second case, your second option of pooling counts and areas is suitable. However, then you have only calculated the actual density in that particular area (ignoring issues of detectability of the organism when counting), and you cannot draw any inferences about a larger statistical population.<\/p>\n\n<p>If your aim is to draw inferences for a larger statistical population, a start is to calculate the mean and standard deviation (sd) of your sample. In that case, I assume that your samples are chosen randomly and independently from a larger statistical population. Your first option is then the right approach. However, since your samples have different sizes, you might want to attach more weight to larger samples, since they can be assumed to better describe the population average than smaller samples. This is called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean\" rel=\"nofollow\">weighted mean<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, the weighted arithmetic mean is defined as: <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\bar{x}_w = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^nw_i}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $w_i$ are the weights for each sample ($x_i$) and $n$ are the number of samples. Using this formula, you will arrive at exactly the same value for the weighted mean as you calculated in your second attempt (0.458), if you use the areas as weights. <\/p>\n\n<p>The weighted standard deviation is a bit more problematic, in the sense that there doesn't exist one single standard way of calculating this. However, a commonly used formula is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ \\sigma_{w_1} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x_i - \\bar{x}_w)^2 }{ \\frac{(M-1)}{M} \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i } },$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $M$ are the number of nonzero weights. Other definitions of the weighted standard deviation can be found at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia: weighted sample variance<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another version is defined as (called \"reliability weights\" on the wiki page):<\/p>\n\n<p>$$ \\sigma_{w_2} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x_i - \\bar{x}_w)^2 }{  \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}}},$$<\/p>\n\n<p>If I haven't made a mistake, these will give the standard deviations 1.15 and 1.22, using your data.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the <strong>biological interpretation<\/strong>, all calculations of average densities indicate a clumped distribution, since the coefficient of variation (CV) is larger than 1 (CV = sd/mean), but more so if you use a weighted mean. The CV using the arithmetric mean is 1.5, while it is 2.5-2.65 for the weighted mean, which is reasonable since you are giving more weight to the large area sample with a zero count. However, I should also note that you should be cautious about using a weighted mean when you have a strongly clumped distribution, since your run the risk that e.g. a large sample plot land on an area with no occurences, which might bias your density estimate. Generally, when you have a clumped distribution, you need to sample more intensively to get a good estimate of average density, and many small samples is often better than a few large ones.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35121,"question_id":35119,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1449653541}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35119/how-should-species-density-be-calculated-for-a-clumped-distribution","last_activity_date":1449653541,"creation_date":1433969417,"answer_count":1,"title":"How should species density be calculated for a clumped distribution?","body":"<p>Lets imagine 5 plots of different size are sampled for a target species:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>plot#  count  area(m^2)  plot_density\n  1      1       5         0.2\n  2      3       2         1.5\n  3      0      10         0.0\n  4      5       1         5.0\n  5      2       6         0.33\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>What is this species' density?

The danger is that it will be resistant to enough of them to cause a significant problem. It takes time to test for antibiotic sensitivity; in the meantime, a person with an infection that needs antibiotic treatment is getting sicker. Labs start testing for antibiotic sensitivity with antibiotics that the identified organism is usually sensitive to. If that fails to reveal <em>sensitivity to an antibiotic at acceptable levels<\/em> - one option is to increase the amount of antibiotic given - new tests need to be carried out, taking even more time (for antibiotic combinations or \"atypical\" antibiotics).

Thus two different hormones can have different biologic effects because the cells that contain those receptors are highly specific. Overall it is the presence of specific cellular receptors that determines the specificity of hormones and their effects.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>A little more in depth of an answer...<\/em> This is a classic concept from graduate physiology and was a real step forward in our understanding of hormone action in the 1950s/1960s. <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earl Sutherland<\/a>, who received the Nobel Prize in 1971 in Physiology or Medicine for this work, was on the faculty at <a href=\"http://pharmacology.case.edu/about/nobel.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Case Western Reserve University<\/a> (and later at <a href=\"http://www.vanderbilt.edu/info/nobel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vanderbilt University<\/a>). Dr. Sutherland was studying the actions of hormones that were involved in glycogen metabolism (i.e. glycogen synthesis and glycogen breakdown). These classic studies identified a substance, now recognized as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate\" rel=\"nofollow\">cyclic AMP<\/a> (cAMP), whose intracellular concentration was increased in liver cells that were treated with hormones that stimulated glycogen breakdown. Conversely, cAMP was decreased by hormones or other conditions that were associated with glycogen synthesis. Most interestingly, it was identified that different hormones that either increased or decreased glycogen synthesis/breakdown had similar effects on the intracellular concentrations of cAMP (e.g. epinephrine, glucagon). This suggested that somehow cAMP was a common signaling molecule (or \"second messenger\") that transmitted the extracellular hormonal signal to the inside of the cell to have a biochemical effect (in this case stimulating glycogen breakdown). <\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of Sutherland's studies, the increased concentration of cAMP stimulated the activity of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protein Kinase A (PKA)<\/a>, and the lack thereof decreased PKA activity and allowed the actions of protein phosphatases to predominate. For example, when glucagon binds its receptor on hepatocytes (liver cells), that receptor is coupled to an intracellular enzyme ($G_S$) that is activated and then can activate an enzyme called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase\" rel=\"nofollow\">adenylyl cyclase<\/a>, which increases synthesis of cAMP from ATP. The increase in cAMP then binds to PKA and phosphorylates the glycogen synthesis enzymes and breakdown enzymes. When the glycogen synthetic enzymes are phosphorylated by PKA they are inactive and, conversely, when the breakdown enzymes are phosphorylated they are active. Thus, glycogen receptor activation leads to activation of the glycogen breakdown machinery and inhibition of the glycogen synthetic machinery. This makes sense physiologically if you think about it - glycogen acts to increase hepatic glycogen breakdown and increase hepatic release of glucose into the circulation. <\/p>\n\n<p>In brief, once Sutherland's group demonstrated the importance of cAMP as a second messenger protein within the cell, other groups began realizing that many other hormones led to changes in intracellular cAMP but each had there own effects. The differences in these effects were determined by the cell type that the hormone was acting on and whether or not that receptor was coupled to a particular second messenger system. Thus, you could have any number of receptors on the cell surface that are available to bind extracellular ligands (e.g. hormones, nutrients, drugs). However, each of these different hormones can be \"coupled\" or linked to different types of intracellular \"second messenger\" processes to transmit a signal. There are many types of second messengers that help transmit extracellular signals to the inside of the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you mention in the question, cAMP is a common second messenger system for a variety of different cell types. However, those different cell types have different receptors that are coupled to cAMP. Thus, hormones can have different effects depending on the tissues that express the receptors. For example, the glucagon receptor is expressed on hepatocytes which increases $G_S$ activity and thus cAMP, leading to glycogen breakdown and increased hepatic glucose production. Similarly, the $\\beta_2$ adrenergic receptor that binds epinephrine/norepinephrine on smooth muscle is also coupled to $G_S$ which increases cAMP and leads to smooth muscle relaxation. These very different hormones have different biologic effects in different tissues, even though the effects are both driven by cAMP-dependent mechanisms. Briefly stated, it is the receptors that are present on a cell, that determine the response of a particular cell to that hormone. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is graphically shown in the image below from this <a href=\"http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/fatty-acid-oxidation.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">medical biochemistry link<\/a> in adipose tissue - though the same concept is true for liver cells. Glucagon signals through its receptor to increase adenylyl cyclase, cAMP and then PKA activity, while insulin inhibits that activation by increasing the activity of PDE (a phosphodiesterase) that works on breaking down cAMP and subsequently keeping PKA in its inactive form.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RzLRd.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RzLRd.png\" alt=\"Insulin and Glucagon Signaling Simplified\"><\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":41135,"question_id":41084,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1448998760}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41084/if-so-many-different-hormones-molecules-work-by-activating-adenylyl-cyclase-how","last_activity_date":1449559291,"creation_date":1448747144,"answer_count":1,"title":"If so many different hormones/molecules work by activating adenylyl cyclase, how do they have different effects?","body":"<p>It seems that many hormones and molecules work by activating adenylyl cyclase to convert $\\text{ATP}$ to $\\text{cAMP}$, such as adrenaline and glucagon. Both of these seem to bind to $\\text G$ protein receptors, cause an alpha subunit to dissociate and bind to adenyly cyclase to activate it, and then adenylyl cyclase forms $\\text{cAMP}$. <strong>If so many molecules work in the same way, how can they have different effects?<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>My guess is that perhaps they may have different molecules inside which respond differently to elevated levels of $\\text{cAMP}$? I presume both cells affected by adrenaline and by glucagon have the protein kinase which, when activated by $\\text{cAMP}$, is able to activate glycogen phosphorylase to break down glycogen, as both adrenaline and glucagon increase blood sugar levels. Perhaps liver cells have more of the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme for a greater rate of breakdown of glycogen? <\/p>\n\n<p>But then when I consider the heart, adrenaline increases heart rate but glucagon does not. If they have the same mechanism of action, how can this discrepancy arise? Could it perhaps be that adrenaline increases heart rate not by acting in the heart cells but in the medulla oblongata to increase the heart rate? But then again I come to the problem of why glucagon does not have the same effect. In this case I could hazard a guess that the glucagon molecule is too large to pass across the blood brain barrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>But this is just one example of a possible problem in how two different molecules use the same mechanism. Although I cannot find a link now, I think I remember that long term potential ion to for new memories involves activation of adenyl cyclase. If that is so, it doesnt make much sense becaus adrenaline certainly doesn't help in the formation of new memories!<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have just also read that insulin works by activating cAMP in hepatocytes/muscle cells, however it also seems that glucagon works by activating cAMP in the same cells!

A wheel and axle would need to be made of living tissue, otherwise it would be vulnerable to wear and tear.  Wheels also have problems going over uneven terrain, which is really all terrain animals live in.  It's difficult to imagine what sort of selection conditions would be strong enough to push animals away from legs. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you include driver-vehicle symbionts where the 'car' and 'wheel' are actually two animals, then they <em>have<\/em> evolved. Parasites can have all sorts of symbiotic control over their victims including as means of transport. The Jewel Wasp is one which is the most suggestive of what you may be thinking. The wasp stings its victim (a cockroach) in the thorax to immobilize the animal and then again just behind its head.  After this, the wasp can ride the beetle, steering it by holding its antennae back to its nest where the roach is immobilized to feed the wasp larvae there.  <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31536/title/Animal-Mind-Control/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(see section \"Pet cockaroaches\" in this reference.)<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As to the three schools of thought you added to the question, I would probably rather say there were two strong arguments against.  The first is whether there is an evolutionary path to wheels, which I doubt (argument 1 in your question).  I really don't think there is.  Given enough time you will not see a naked human being able to fly on their own power \u2014 too many structural characteristics of the body plan have been made to all be reversed so that wings or other means of aerial conveyance will show up. The same can be said for wheels when the body plans have fins/legs/and wings already. <\/p>\n\n<p>Argument 3, which I also tend to agree with, is perhaps more convincing.  By the time a pair of animals makes a symbiotic relationship to do this, or a single macroscopic animal evolves wheels, they will literally grow legs and walk away. When life came onto the land this happened, and since then it's happened several times.  It's sort of like saying that water might cooperate to run a stream uphill. There's just such a strong path downwards, that the statistical chances of you seeing it happen are nil.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is a hypothetical case, but arguing this in a convincing way I think you would need to lay out:  a) an environment whose conditions created enough of a selective advantage for wheels to evolve over legs or other similar adaptations we already see. Perhaps based on the energy efficiency of wheels;   b) some sort of physiological model for the wheels that convey a reasonable lifestyle for the wheel. <\/p>\n\n<p>There seem to be lots of questions like \"the symbiotic wheel would be spinning constantly; if it died the driver creature would be completely defenseless\"; \"if the ground were bumpy, all these wheeled animals would get eaten\"; \"the wheel symbiont \u2014 how would it eat while its spinning all the time? Only fed by the driver? Even symbionts such as barnacles or lampreys on the flanks of sharks still have their own ability to feed.\"  <\/p>\n\n<p>A similar question \u2014 why are all the flying animals and fish and plants even more similar to airplanes than helicopters?  Same sort of discussion ensues. <\/p>\n\n<p>For all these scenarios I see a lot of disadvantages and not a lot of advantages.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I seem negative, but when I was a grad student I actually did think about this, so I'm somewhat familiar with the issues. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/the-first-gear-discovered-in-nature-15916433\" rel=\"nofollow\">First Gear found in a Living Creature<\/a>.<\/strong> \nA <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6151/1254.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">european plant hopper insect with one of the largest accelerations known in biology has been found to have gears<\/a>!

Once again selection suprises. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gears themselves are an oddity. With gear teeth shaped like\n  cresting waves, they look nothing like what you'd find in your car or\n  in a fancy watch.  There could be two\n  reasons for this. Through a mathematical oddity, there is a limitless\n  number of ways to design intermeshing gears. So, either nature evolved\n  one solution at random, or, as Gregory Sutton, coauthor of the paper\n  and insect researcher at the University of Bristol, suspects, the\n  shape of the issus's gear is particularly apt for the job it does.\n  It's built for \"high precision and speed in one direction,\" he says.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The gears do not rotate 360 degrees, but appear on the surface of two joints to synchronize them as they wind up like a circular spring.  The gear itself is not living tissue, so the big solves the problem of regenerating the gear by growing a new set when it molts (i.e. gears that continually regenerate and heal are still unknown).  It also does not keep its gears throughout its lifecycle.

The 3,500-calorie rule has become a universal constant in the complex calculus of weight loss, but the truth may not be so simple: a new mathematical model predicts that the energy deficit required to lose a pound depends on how much fat a person has to start with.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the model, 3,500 calories per pound is a reasonable estimate for those who are moderately obese, but not necessarily for others. When dieting, those with a high percentage of body fat will mainly lose fat, whereas leaner people will lose a higher proportion of lean body mass, such as muscle or liver tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because lean body mass stores less energy per pound than fat, the model predicts that trimmer people require less of a caloric deficit to shed weight. Not that this will always be easy to achieve.<\/p>\n\n<p>The results do not necessarily mean that it is easier for skinnier people to lose weight, says Kevin Hall, a biophysicist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Lean body mass uses up more of the body's energy than fat does, so losing lean body mass should reduce the body\u2019s overall energy needs. Therefore a person who maintains a steady diet may actually put weight on, as their smaller body needs less fuel to maintain itself. \n Food for thought<\/p>\n\n<p>Hall first began to wonder about the 3,500-calorie rule when he embarked on a project to model weight regulation. \u201cIt took a long time to track it down,\u201d he says. \u201cDieticians are tested on this idea; textbooks quote it. But no one could tell me where it came from.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>It came from a study published in the 1950s that was heavily skewed towards overweight women. Since then, scientists have learned that not everyone loses weight in the same way. \u201cOne of the big assumptions was that when people lose weight, they lose fat tissue,\u201d says Hall. \u201cWe now know that\u2019s not true. They lose lean body mass as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Hall decided to calculate the energy stored in lean body mass. He found that the energy density of lean body mass was five-fold smaller than the energy density of fat. His results are published in the March issue of the International Journal of Obesity1.<\/p>\n\n<p>When lean body mass was incorporated into his weight-loss models, a clear difference emerged. For someone who weighed 100 kilograms and wanted to lose 5 kilograms, the rule of thumb worked well: they would need to burn nearly 39,000 more calories than they use. Assuming no change in energy use and an average daily intake of about 2,000 calories, that means avoiding the equivalent of 2 chocolate bars a day (about 500 calories) for 2.5 months. But to achieve the same weight loss in a 50-kilogram person required a caloric shortfall only two-thirds as large.\nWeighty matters<\/p>\n\n<p>Growing concerns about obesity have fuelled a push to better understand such issues, says Steven Heymsfield of the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company Merck. Heymsfield notes that several companies, including Merck, have launched large-scale weight-loss studies that include measurements of body composition. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in understanding the regulation of long-term changes in body weight,\u201d says Heymsfield. \u201cYou\u2019d like to know: are the dynamics for a 60 year old who goes on a diet the same as for a 20 year old? Because they probably aren\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Heymsfield and his collaborators showed that the energy deficit required to lose weight varied between men and women, and between young and old2. Their results were in line with what Hall found: women \u2014 who have a higher percentage of body fat than men \u2014 required a higher caloric deficit to lose weight. Similarly, a person aged about 70 needs a larger calorie deficit to achieve the same weight loss as someone who is 35 years old.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does all of this mean that the textbooks should be amended? Hall notes that for obese people, the original equation works reasonably well. \u201cFor those who are recommended to lose weight, the rule isn\u2019t that bad,\u201d he says.

In other words, compute B-C and look for the maximum (through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(differential_algebra)\" rel=\"nofollow\">derivation<\/a>) and you found the optimal phenotype (often behaviour).

For example, there is a large body of literature on cross-modal activation of visual areas in the brain in blind people. It is known that visual deprivation results in neural plasticity and the recruitment of visual areas in the brain for other sensory systems. For example, blind Braille readers show activation of the primary visual cortex when reading Braille <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/H_Stronks/publication/280118618_The_role_of_visual_deprivation_and_experience_on_the_performance_of_sensory_substitution_devices/links/55ca07d608aea2d9bdcbf35b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(reviewed in Stronks <em>et al<\/em>., 2015)<\/a>. However, interpretation of these findings is difficult in late-blind individuals, because they have experienced visual input earlier in life. Hence, while Braille reading they can be mentally reproducing the visual representation of the Braille cells using visual neural circuitry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Indeed, it has been shown with fMRI that <strong>visual imagery and visual perception draw on most of the same neural machinery<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.neurosci.info/courses/systems/FMRI/kosslyn04.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Ganis <em>et al<\/em>., 2004)<\/a>. However, the spatial overlap of the activated regions is neither complete nor uniform. The overlap in this study was more pronounced in frontal and parietal regions than in temporal and occipital regions, indicating that cognitive control processes function comparably in both imagery and perception, but not identically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Various studies reveal different results, however. In another imaging study, 'just' two-thirds of brain regions overlapped in visual sensation and imagery <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/284/5411/167\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Kosslyn <em>et al<\/em>., 1997)<\/a>. Indeed, the experimental task used may have important effects on study outcomes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most notably in this regard is that approximately half of the studies done have found activation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>primary visual cortex<\/strong><\/a> during imagery <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811997902950\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Kosslyn <em>et al<\/em>., 1999)<\/a>. This is interesting, because the primary visual cortex is generally thought to be an early, low-level area in the visual system that depends on thalamic input that relays information from the optic nerve to the brain.

In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to\n  the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of\n  light, which marred the sight of real objects and interfered with my\n  thought and action. They were pictures of things and scenes which I\n  had really seen, never of those I imagined. When a word was spoken to\n  me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly\n  to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether\n  what I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and\n  anxiety. None of the students of psychology or physiology whom I have\n  consulted could ever explain satisfactorily these phenomena. They seem\n  to have been unique although I was probably predisposed as I know that\n  my brother experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated\n  is that the images were the result of a reflex action from the brain\n  on the retina under great excitation. They certainly were not\n  hallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds,\n  for in other respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my\n  distress, suppose that I had witnessed a funeral or some such\n  nerve-racking spectacle. Then, inevitably, in the stillness of night,\n  a vivid picture of the scene would thrust itself before my eyes and\n  persist despite all my efforts to banish it. Sometimes it would even\n  remain fixed in space though I pushed my hand through it. If my\n  explanation is correct, it should be able to project on a screen the\n  image of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such an advance\n  would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this\n  wonder can and will be accomplished in time to come; I may add that I\n  have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The rest of <a href=\"http://www.teslasautobiography.com/my_early_life.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">his autobiography<\/a> has more details<\/p>\n","answer_id":41230,"question_id":41092,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1449242443}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41092/is-there-a-difference-between-visual-sensation-and-imagination-in-the-brain","last_activity_date":1449522659,"creation_date":1448789681,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is there a difference between visual sensation and imagination in the brain?","body":"<p>How substantial is the difference between the neural signal associated with seeing an image and the imagination of that image?

Think about ways in which DnaA binding or activity can be regulated in a way that inhibits or permits DNA replication. In recently replicated bacterial DNA, the DNA is hemimethylated (parental strand has a methyl group, daughter strand doesn't): An inhibiting protein binds to hemimethylated DNA, that can block DnaA activity at the oriC. A DAM methylase adds methyl groups after a while to the newly synthesized DNA, in which case DnaA may bind. Due to the lag between replication and methylation, DNA replication can't be continuously initiated! This is one of many examples (for example, DnaA must bind ATP for it's mechanism of action), but the take home point is DNA replication must be <strong>initiated<\/strong> and if it can't be, then it doesn't take place!<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www-als.lbl.gov/index.php/research-areas/bioscience/223-the-initiation-of-bacterial-dna-replication.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">THE INITIATION OF BACTERIAL DNA REPLICATION<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Breaking that down:<\/strong> (note, this is in <em>E. coli<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>DnaA is a protein with DNA-binding activity. When many DnaA bind at the oriC, it causes the DNA to bend open and loop. At this point, DnaB would have access to the DNA, and this is the helicase that unwinds everything for replication (you'll also see that DnaB must be loaded onto the DNA by DnaC, a helicase loader). So blunty enough, oriC is an origin of replication, everything starts here. There are repeats of AT rich regions denoted 13mer and 9mer in the oriC (number of bases in the region if you will). We know that this is beneficial because AT rich regions are easiest to pull apart due to the number of hydrogen bonds between A and T.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the example I provided, the assumption is that the DNA of <em>E. coli<\/em> is methylated on adenines on both strands. When replication occurs, the new DNA doesn't have this methyl group on it's adenines like the parental strand. A protein that recognizes and binds so-called hemimethylated (half methylated) DNA, SeqA, binds where it can, including in the oriC. It blocks DnaA subsequently for a short time, and falls off the DNA on its own. The DAM methylase adds the methyl groups when it can, and once it does the SeqA can no longer bind, but the replication-initiation complex thus can. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are <strong>other<\/strong> modulators of DNA replication, and the concentration of the DnaA itself is a big factor because you need many units of DnaA to bind to facilitate initiation.

In my experience, if you try to measure plasma glucose with a whole blood glucose meter the results are highly variable for a number of reasons (mentioned below). Using blood glucose meters to measure plasma glucose is <strong>dangerous<\/strong>. The meters are calibrated for whole blood and not plasma, which is chemically different and will yield different results. Depending on the clinical situation (or experimental situation), the results can be significantly different and non-linear across a huge spectrum of concentrations. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://faculty.virginia.edu/analyticalchemistry/Electrochem%20Gluc/Electrochem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a nice link from the University of Virginia demonstrating the basics of how one type of these meters works.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of types of glucose meters commercially available to the public as well as healthcare facilities. Most of these meters use varying solid-state chemistry techniques to drive the production of an electrical current that can be measured by the glucose meter. In other words, when the blood is taken up by the strip in the meter the glucose takes part in a redox chemical reaction that creates a small \"electrical current\" that is detected by the meter. <em>The amount of glucose in the sample is proportional to the electrical current produced<\/em>. However, there are a number of assumptions that the meters make (which can differ between meters). One of the most clinically significant assumptions is that the meter assumes that the hematocrit (i.e. the percentage of blood volume that is erythrocytes) is <strong>normal<\/strong> or approximately 45%. If you use these types of meters on plasma (which has no erythrocytes in it), the chemistry is inaccurate because the meter \"thinks\" all the glucose that it is detecting is actually dispersed within a pool of erythrocytes in a hematocrit of 45%. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769957/\" rel=\"nofollow\">There are a number of other issues and important points discussed in this review<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the clinical trials (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625\" rel=\"nofollow\">NICE-SUGAR<\/a>) began showing that intensive glucose control was associated with improved mortality, clinical practices changed from keeping blood glucose concentrations in critically ill patients between 150 and 250 mg/dl to a much lower concentrations (i.e. 80-120 mg/dl). As these new guidelines began rolling out, there were a number of subsequent studies that showed that intensive glucose control was actually associated with more frequent hypoglycemia episodes. There were likely a number of issues to explain this, but one of those was that if your meters were not correcting for differences in hematocrit the blood glucose meters would read spuriously higher than what the true measurement was (thus, you could be treating someone with insulin to lower their glucose that was 160 mg/dl - when in true the value was much, much lower). <\/p>\n","answer_id":41204,"question_id":20325,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20325/can-you-measure-plasma-glucose-with-a-regular-glucose-meter","last_activity_date":1449509374,"creation_date":1407446277,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can you measure plasma glucose with a regular glucose meter?","body":"<p>I'm wondering if plasma glucose can be measured with a regular glucose meter and strips like <a href=\"http://www.adwdiabetes.com/product/free-truebalance-meter-kit_1606.htm?source=GoogleBase&amp;zmam=69792428&amp;zmas=1&amp;zmac=2&amp;zmap=2129200312KIT&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwx4yfBRCt2rrAs-P5vtkBEiQAOdFXbZicho2Iysf_AAL2oypo69bLltFs2rS1ETURpNfODNUaAs-e8P8HAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>.

In other words, Darwin did not know the <a href=\"https://www.dnalc.org/view/16151-Biography-1-Gregor-Mendel-1822-1884-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Law of Segregation by Gregor Mendel<\/a> (even if they lived in the same epoch).<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Evolution is more than natural selection and mutations<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution is not only about natural selection. Even C. Darwin knew that evolution is way more than natural selection. It is for example very important to consider random events. One of them is <em>mutation<\/em>, another is <em>genetic drift<\/em> (I am not trying to list every processes that influence evolution but only to give you a sense of why natural selection is different than evolution with a goal of explaining why a trait that is needed do not necessarily appear). Both mutations and genetic drift explain why a species will not necessarily be perfectly adapted to its environment. Evolutionary biology is a big field of knowledge and there is a lot to know about evolutionary processes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Selection and Mutations explained by the Lewontin Recipe<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Lewontin recipe is a good way in order to understand what is natural selection and when it occurs. The Lewontin recipe says that natural selection occurs whenever:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Individuals in a population varies in terms of a given trait<\/li>\n<li>This trait has some (additive) heritability. <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/home.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is one of the several posts that explain the concept of heritability. It might be slightly a post that is a bit advanced for you though but shortly speaking it means that offspring are more similar to their parents more than they are to other non-kin individuals in the population.<\/li>\n<li>The fitness varies (not necessarily linearly) as the trait varies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Simple example:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In a population, there are blue pens and red pens<\/li>\n<li>Reproduction is asexual and blue pens create other blue pens while red pens create other red pens.<\/li>\n<li>blue pens make more offspring than red pens.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In such situation natural selection occurs yielding the frequency of the blue pens to increase in the population while the frequency of red pens will decrease.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Selection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Natural Selection is the process by which variants of genes called alleles are selected and therefore increase in frequency. This selection result from a differential reproductive success.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In the broad sense mutation is any change in the DNA sequence. Some changes are more likely to happen that other but in any case the likeliness of these changes to happen is not dependent on the consequence they will have on the phenotype (shortly speaking, phenotype is how an individual looks like) and on the reproductive success. So mutations occur randomly and the specific mutation that would be needed in the population may not occur. Therefore saying, if a trait is needed (in the sense of \"if a trait would be beneficial\"), then a mutation will occur to make this trait existing is wrong. Note that most mutations are deleterious (decrease the reproductive success) while few of them are beneficial (increase the reproductive success) and those that are beneficial are more likely to raise in frequency in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic drift<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If the change in frequency of mutations would depend exclusively on natural selection, then I would not have said before that a beneficial mutation is more likely to raise in frequency but I would have said that a beneficial mutation will raise in frequency deterministically. An intuitive explanation of what is genetic drift can be found on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">this post<\/a>. It will also allow you to understand why small population undergo more random change in frequency of their genes than are big population.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Considering your opposing statements<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, the following is clear from the above discussion but I would like to directly address your statements.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My friend said that Natural Selection is a mechanism inside the organism that mutates the DNA to make its offspring survive in an environment; that natural selection mutates the DNA beneficially and that random mutations are not useful (like blue eyes). But I disagree and think that it is closer to Lamarkian theory.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>You are right, it is wrong!<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It indeed sounds more or less Lamarkian. In any case, it is very wrong as you said. Mutations are not caused deterministically under the pressure of natural selection to do specific things.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Are mutations completely random?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>I do not want to go into too much complications. The sentence \"mutations are random\" is unclear. Does it mean that the mutation rate is random? Does it mean that the effect of a new mutation is random? And also the concept of randomness only make sense if we consider a set of a priori knowledge. So it is a little hard to fully answer this question and the easy, close-enough approximation for a starter in evolutionary biology is just to say that mutations are random (whatever that means). A slightly better approximation of reality is that mutation rate is adaptive and can vary depending on the environment where the individual is found (adaptively or not). However, the effect of new mutations is really not deterministic. <\/p>\n\n<p>The mutation rate vary with the type of sequence considered. For example a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite\" rel=\"nofollow\">microsatellite sequence<\/a> are sequence or repeated DNA. For example <code>AATAATAATAATAATAATAAT<\/code> etc.. (note that the genetic code is written with 4 letters, A, T, C and G). Such sequence are highly mutable. So a mutation is more likely to occur in this region than in the middle of a coding region. And it is more likely for a mutation occurring in a coding region to affect fitness than for a mutation occurring in a microsatellite (it is possible that a mutation occuring in a microsatellite will affect fitness). <\/p>\n\n<p>Depending on the level of stress some organisms (plants mostly to my knowledge) can change their mutation rate. Consider for example an individual that is maladapted to its environment. If it mutates little, then the offspring will likely be as maladapted and in the long run the lineage will disappear. If the individual is mutating a lot then, most offspring will have a very low fitness but eventually one will receive a beneficial mutation that will make it very strong and by itself this offspring may save the lineage. This is what is called a <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1685/1153\" rel=\"nofollow\">bet-hedging strategy<\/a>. The concept of bet-hedging can be summarized with the expression \"Don't put all your eggs in the same basket\".<\/p>\n\n<p>You will note that the mutation rate is an evolving feature of organism. This yield observation such as what is now called the Drake's rule (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/88/16/7160.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">original paper<\/a>). Drake's rule indicate that the genome-wide mutation rate is always at the order of 1 (there is quite a bit of variation but it is a good approximation). <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I told him that DNA from male and female recombines and randomly mutates making a new \"recipe\" for the offspring (adding a new characteristic(s)). If the offspring is well suited for the environment, then it survives and passes on its characteristics to its offspring. If it does not have fitness for its environment, it dies. So, Natural Selection is were nature \"selects\" who survives and reproduces a lot.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sounds quite right!<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>You pretty much nailed it. Mutation add genetic variation and natural selection select from the available genetic variation. The wording is a little uncommon though :). Note also, that the majority of mutations that affect the fitness of the individuals are not so much dependent on the details of the environment. Many mutations are just bad wherever you are. Think about a mutation that would reduce the efficiency of energy production (ATP in mitochondria). Such a mutation will be deleterious regardless of whether the weather is hot or cold for example.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Introductory course to evolutionary biology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You probably want to have a look at an introductory course to evolutionary biology such as <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/home.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding Evolution<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40165,"question_id":40156,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1449505652},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0329819d1cfd8d00c4bddc535abe1c94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19770,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19770/b-m","reputation":113,"display_name":"B M"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1446422014,"creation_date":1446422014,"body":"<p>Great answers have been given already.

If the offspring is well suited for the environment, then it survives and passes on its characteristics to its offspring. If it does not have fitness for its environment, it dies. So, Natural Selection is were nature \"selects\" who survives and reproduces a lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>So is the DNA mutation process random or is mutation directed to make an organism that is suited to survive its environment?<\/p>\n\n<p>None of my friends are a Biology student, so I can't ask then which explanation is correct (or at least more valid).<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd prefer you dont answer: \"None of these explanations are correct,\" but to say which one is more valid and correct misconceptions or add more that is missing (of course these are only summaries of our discussion).

This takes place in the egg and as well in the sperm cell and consists of small modifications added to the DNA.

It would still require an oocyte for doing that. <\/p>\n\n<p>The question now is- Can you produce oocytes from a male?<\/p>\n\n<p>You may fuse two <code>X<\/code> bearing haploid spermatids to form a diploid cell with <code>XX<\/code>. This cell will also have mitochondria and ribosomes \u2014 seems like a decent candidate. Gametogenesis has not been shown to happen in-vitro.

The bacterium produces an AB toxin that enters cells and kill them.<\/p>\n\n<p>(3) The host is infected by a helminth.<\/p>\n\n<p>In situation 1: Innate immune responses are associated with the secretion of many <strong>cytokines<\/strong> and <strong>chemokines<\/strong>. Cytokines are associated with the inflammatory response, and chemokines are associated with lymphocyte trafficking. Inflammation and recruitment of lymphocytes, macrophages and the like are good for clearing the infection, but there's a lot of potential to damage the surrounding tissue. Effector cells from the adaptive response incl. humoral immunity don't elicit the same level of damage, and we can illustrate this in mucosal immunity. Since commensal (and some pathogenic) organisms are constantly stimulating mucosal immunity, there are (1) epithelial effector T cells, (2) plasma cells and (3) dendritic cells that make the response to these pathogens fast, efficient and little damage occurs to the tissue involved.<\/p>\n\n<p>In situation 2: So let's say the pathogen has escaped the immune response, maybe it's encapsulated. There are AB toxins being produced that kill cells endocytosing them. What good will it do for a phagocyte to eat something that ends up killing it? Antibodies are particularly efficient for this extent because they can neutralize toxins they've encountered with the same fast, efficient response as we described above. This is achieved through antigen presentation. The host will then need to find other ways to clear the infection, however.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So:<\/strong> In situation 1 we illustrated that an innate, systemic response isn't always desirable due to tissue damage, and through the presentation to T cells by APCs, a later adaptive immune response mitigates this effect through formation of effector cells. In situation 2, we then illustrated that the first-line defenses can't always respond to the imminent threat for various reasons, which are overcome by the presence of effector cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Situation 3: This is the more complex concept. You have different subsets of CD4+ T cells that can be formed in response to the <strong>type of interleukin or cytokine that is present when the CD4+ T cells are being activated<\/strong>. This differentiation is driven largely by secretions of activated APCs! The APC performs this critical step based on what kind of receptors the specific types of pathogen are detected by. The differentiated CD4+ T cells, or T-helper cells of class: Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, etc. each perform different roles which are effective in different situations. For example, you wouldn't see any benefit in throwing Th1 cells at a helminth infection, Th2 is the best effector for this. Treg cells are capable of abrogating autoreactivity, and Th17 cells are needed to assist B cell differentiation in response to antigen detection (<em>which<\/em> in the case of helminths, the B cell must class switch to IgE and this is stimulated by Th2 cells via IL-4).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, in situation 3, we've illustrated that CD4+ T cell intermediates are providing your overall immune response: flexibility, specificity, and checks/balances which are all-at-once critical to healthy functioning. I disregarded MHC-I responses and CD8+ CTL's because this is about APC-driven responses. <\/p>\n","answer_id":41261,"question_id":39333,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39333/why-apcs-present-antigen-to-t-cells","last_activity_date":1449351788,"creation_date":1444142237,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why APC's present antigen to T cells?","body":"<p>the macrophages are pretty known well for antigen presenting process and to present the antigens which are bound to pathogens unlike exotoxins (which are free) the pathogen first should be digested and destructed and derive the antigenic portion and present it to T cells then stimulate the B cells to make antibodies.

There is lot of work still being done on this. Unfortunately I don't think I know enough about CS or computer engineering to make analogies, so I'll give a quick crash course and some examples instead and hope you find it helpful. Long story short though is that we are just now making really exciting headway into how memory might actually be stored and recalled and its usually a very dynamic, active, and possibly even stochastic process, not really like a search algorithm in a computer at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>The brain works differently than a computer in that it encodes all of its information in frequency of signal firing and the patterns of firing between circuits with varying stregnths of connections based on experiences. Frequency is dependent on the neuron itself and patterns of firing between circuits are dependent on where the neurons project to, and how strongly they interact with the next neuron. At this very basic level memory is stored and recalled by placing proteins in the membranes of neurons that are strongly activated to make them easier activated in the future. These are sort of the first steps toward memory. This is called long term potentiation and just means that this neuron is primed to fire more readily and stronger in response to similar input in the future. <\/p>\n\n<p>To build on this,  there is a classic example of this occuring and causing sensitization ( an exaggerated response to the same stimulus) in conditioning experiments in the sea slug Aplysia. Aplysia has a reflex where it will withdraw its gills slightly if you touch its siphon. You can pair a shock to the tail (unconditioned stimulus) which elicits a large withdrawal of the gills, with a conditioned stimulus (touching its syphon to elicit the withdrawal reflex) to get the sea slug to associate the two. The end result is that the sea slug will learn/\"remember\" to withdraw its gills fully in the presence of the syphon touch. No learning cannot happen without recall of some sort, and in this example the slug was associating and learning from two \"circuits\" to produce a different behavior.<\/p>\n\n<p>In something a little more complex than a slug, memory and recall still functions much the same way, its just the circuits that are interacting are entire brain regions. Most people view the hippocampus as acting sort of like a relay center and boot loader for different memories by taking external input and sorting them to the right parts of the brain. A good example of this would be the difference between dorsal and ventral streams of information in the brain. For a really basic breakdown of this phenomenon there are two areas of your brain that I will focus on - the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe. The parietal lobe is known to be involved in spatial processing, and the temporal lobes are known to be involved in semantic and auditory processing. When information enters the brain (eyes, ears, nose etc.) it will be processed by sensory structures, sent to the thalamus and hippocampus to be \"relayed\" to the right areas of the brain. Relayed in this case is going to be dictated by whatever connections and how strong they are in the brain. In this case from proteins expressed in the cellular membrane that make some neurons in the hippocampus more responsive than others, so they are more likely to fire. Then, it depends on where they are projecting to that determines where they information is sent. <\/p>\n\n<p>It just so happens the brain is arranged in such a way that neurons projecting dorsally, or to the parietal lobe I mentioned, will tell you \"where\" the stimulus is, and those projecting ventral to the temporal lobes will tell you \"what\" it is. This is achieved because these lobes are highly interconnected to even more regions in the brain and send their processed \"where\" and \"what\" info as input to other regions. These regions will all fire a certain way in response to this information and that pattern of firing can be considered a recollection or memory. Sorry that this is dense and so crash course-y but I hope it is helpful in clarifying how the brain recalls some information. Of course this is  a developing field and we are learning more about how it functions every day.

Of course any mutation that occurs in cells are located in your hand or in your brain for example will not be transmitted to the offsprings. Only mutations occurring in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline\" rel=\"nofollow\">germline<\/a> (cells in the testis and in the ovaries whose descendent or themselves go through meiosis) are possibly pass to the offsprings. Interestingly, because of the developmental pathways of sperm cells and ovules, sperm cells go through a lot more mitosis than ovules do, resulting in more mutations in the sperms than in the ovules. Therefore, if you look at a mutation in an individual and assuming you know that the mutation occurred during the lifetime of the parents, then you are more likely that the mutation comes from the father than from the mother.<\/p>\n\n<p>As reviewed by <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol85/iss4/1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cochran and Harpending (2013)<\/a>, mothers transmits on average a number x of new mutations to their offspring. This number x is independent of the age of the Mother. Fathers, however transmit a number of new mutations to their offsprings that is very much dependent on the age of the father for developmental reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course as it has been pointed out there are various environmental factors that may increase or diminish the mutation rate (such as the mutagens (Tobacco, X-ray, ..))<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note on the process of adaptation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to know that vast majority of mutations are deleterious (impact negatively the reproductive success and survival of the individual carrying it). If we assume that no selection occurs between the cells of the germline, then no adaptation is possible. And in average sperm cells of an old guy should have lower fitness than the sperm cells of the same guy when he was younger. This process is referred to as mutation accumulation (mutation accumulation is not a concept that is specific to somatic lines mutations). However, one may argue the opposite! One might think that the cells that carry the new mutations (the mutation that occurred during the lifetime of the man) may be selected for or counter selected. In such case, the few beneficial mutations might be enough to make our cell lineages more fit with age. Whether the fitness of cells increase or decrease through our lifetime is dependent on the effective population size, the mutation rate and distribution of mutational effects. One can calculate the critical parameters yielding to one (mutation accumulation and fitness decrease) or the other (fitness increase through age) thanks to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_meltdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutational meltdown<\/a> literature.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to note however that what increase the fitness of a cell might decrease the fitness of its carrier. Knowing the joint distribution of mutational effect for both the carrier and the cells should allow us to calculate if reproducing late in life allows to transmit better genes than reproducing early in life. Intuitively, I would expect that reproducing early in life would allow a parent to transmit better genes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Epigenetics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We have to talk about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">epigenetics<\/a> also.

This forces the Yz into a radical state Yz*. As the article goes on to provide, data showed the Yz hydroxyl group pKa to be greater than 9, meaning it should be protonated at physiological pH. As a result, in concert with the electron transfer outlined above, a proton is donated <em>from<\/em> Yz* to a nearby base: histidine 190. In this manner, Yz* is capable of quickly oxidizing the nearby tetranuclear manganese cluster.
