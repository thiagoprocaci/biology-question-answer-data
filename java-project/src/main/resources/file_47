Some cells such as neurons (and also perhaps cardiac muscles) are highly sensitive to loss of oxygen (for energy requirements) and clinical death because of hypoxia usually occurs because of loss basic brain function. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What percentage of the oxygen we take in through respiration is\n  expelled later through the breath as carbon dioxide?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As already mentioned, it is said that there is a rough 1:1 ratio of CO<sub>2<\/sub> production and O<sub>2<\/sub> consumption. However, as indicated in a comment by CurtF, O<sub>2<\/sub> does not form CO<sub>2<\/sub>; it forms water in the last reaction of ETC. CO<sub>2<\/sub> is produced in other reactions of Krebs cycle. <\/p>\n\n<p>Glycolysis produces 32 molecules of ATP for 1 molecule of glucose via ETC (see <a href=\"http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lecturesf04am/lect12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>). There are three complexes in ETC and the third is dependent on oxygen; so you can assume that 1/2 a molecule of O<sub>2<\/sub> consumed for production of 3 ATP molecules. Therefore 32 molecules of ATP would consume 4 molecules of O<sub>2<\/sub>. Seems like there is a 1:1 ratio of CO<sub>2<\/sub> production and O<sub>2<\/sub> consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can see it like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>FADH<sub>2<\/sub> enters ETC at the second complex whereas NADH enters at the first. We can say that as long as NADH is present FADH<sub>2<\/sub> would not require an extra oxygen.<\/p>\n\n<p>An NADH or a FADH<sub>2<\/sub> molecule would require 1/2 molecule of O<sub>2<\/sub>. There are 8 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH<sub>2<\/sub> produced during glycolysis+krebs cycle which would require 10/2 = <strong>5<\/strong> molecules of O<sub>2<\/sub>. Glycolysis produces 4 molecules of CO<sub>2<\/sub> during krebs cycle. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, 2 cytosolic NADH molecules require 2 ATPs (in other words another NADH molecule) to be transported to mitochondria.

In response to a bacterial attack, their fat body (the equivalent of the liver in mammals) synthesizes a whole range of peptides with an antibacterial and antifungal effect.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This fascinated me, as the clear inference is that there are no \u2018dedicated\u2019 immune cells, but that adipose tissue has far more diverse functions that I had realized.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have done a little more reading, and also looked at plant immune systems, which seems far more analogous to those in insects than mammals;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Plants, unlike mammals, lack mobile defender cells and a somatic adaptive immune system.

This is because, for a variety of reasons, the change in DNA/RNA sequence may not significantly alter the structure and function of the ribozyme/protein (the function that contributes to the fitness of the organism). If two alleles of a gene with different sequence have equivalent function (again with regard to the function of the gene that provides fitness) the differences between them are selectively neutral.<\/p>\n\n<p>The neutral network consists of every variation in the sequence of the gene that can be reached from another sequence (of equivalent fitness) by a single base pair mutation (these aren't the only type of mutation, possible, but they are common and more likely to be neutral than more drastic changes). So for example (using an unrealistically short sequence), if I had a gene with the sequence  0 AACAATGCTGACTGA, and alleles 1 AACAATGCTGACTAA, 2 AACAATGCTGACAGA, 3 AACAATGCTGACTGG with equivalent function, 1, 2, and 3 would be directly linked to 0 in the neutral network as they all differ from 0 by a single base pair. The sequence 4 GACAATGCTGACTAA if of equivalent function would also be in the network as it differs by one base pair from sequence 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each gene in the network being mutually accessible through mutations means that I could start out with any of the above sequences and reach any of the others through a series of single base pair mutations that traverse the network (i.e. I could mutate 0 into 4 by first mutating to 1, another network member, then to 4). <\/p>\n\n<p>The genotypic space includes the sequences of all extant alleles of the gene. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/96/17/9716.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper<\/a> suggests that there is a tendency for these sequences to form these networks and especially to evolve towards highly interconnected networks. This is the structural information the author refers to. It should be easy to imagine how this might confer robustness to deleterious mutation. Let's think about our sequences from above, imagine if every sequence was only linked to two other selectively neutral sequences forming a long chain. The sequence AACAATGCTGACTGA is 15 base pairs long with 45 possible single mutations, if only two of those are selectively neutral, the chance of mutating to a neutral network member is low, and even if you do hit on a neutral mutation, your chance of hitting another neutral mutation next time (reverting back or moving on down the chain) is still only 2/45. Now imagine that the neutral network is highly interconnected, with sequence 0 linked to sequences 1, 2, 3 and several other neutral 1 base pair changes, imagine those sequences are linked through each other by other neutral intermediates (being 2 base pair mutations away from 0). Not only is the chance of a single mutation being neutral higher, but subsequent mutations (remember that these include reversions from prior mutations) are more likely to stay within the network (you're more likely to come back around to 0. <\/p>\n\n<p>Would you have more long-term success walking around a fitness plateau or walking across a fitness rope suspended over the abyss?<\/p>\n","answer_id":35301,"question_id":35272,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1434578060}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35272/what-is-a-selectively-neutral-genotypic-change","last_activity_date":1434578060,"creation_date":1434487850,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is a selectively neutral genotypic change?","body":"<p>I am reading the paper \"Neutral evolution of mutational robustness\".

When distortion happens; for e.g. the if wooden plank bends, the resting object comes closer to ground with a reduction in its potential energy. Now the weight is balanced by the reaction force which is basically the force exerted on the plank to get back to its original position (analogous to the spring; $F=-kx$). Even in this case the material property of the wood is, more or less, invariant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Getting back to biology. Muscles consume energy in order to maintain their material properties, even if they do not perform work. Muscles can be thought of as dynamic materials because their material properties can change.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you are holding a dumbbell in your hand with your arm poised at an angle then your biceps need energy to keep maintaining that tension (a temporary material property).

However, internally, the muscle looks like a collapsible array of filaments, with myosin heads acting as crossbridges between them. Even when the muscle is not contracting, myosin heads unbind and rebind at some rate and would let the muscle relax -- unless you input more energy to compensate this with a further contraction.<\/p>\n\n<p>For smooth muscle, according to <a href=\"http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/725\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a>, the rate of unbinding can be very slow:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once the contraction has occurred, the cross bridge attachments need\n  to be released in order that the muscle can relax. Although less is\n  known about this phenomenon, it appears to be related to\n  dephosphorylation of MLC20. In some situations, the dephosphory- lated\n  MLC20 is very slow to allow detachment of the actin from the myosin\n  cross bridge, resulting in a prolonged contraction. This has been\n  referred to as a \u2018latch-bridge\u2019 (Hai and Murphy, 1988). This\n  phenomenon may be of great value especially for tonically active SM\n  beds as it would allow them to maintain basal tone through holding in\n  an isometric state without a great energy cost.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So as the muscle is not relaxing, no input of energy is needed to adjust its length to the desired one.

In other words, this weight-table system does not need to be provided with energy at all, for the table to be able to support the weight, because it takes no energy to support it.<\/p>\n\n<p>What about an identical case but with a human hand supporting a weight(at a constant height) at this time? Although according to the above reasoning one should expect that it does not need any energy to support the weight, this is not what we observe in everyday life, because when I hold the weight, it takes a tremendous amount of effort to support and maintain its position.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I looked up the reason behind this, I found out that it has to do with the fact that the muscles of the arm are <strong>skeletal<\/strong> muscles not a <strong>smooth<\/strong> one.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the arm were made out of <strong>smooth<\/strong> muscles, then it would take no effort or energy at all to support any weight at a fixed height.On the other hand, the muscle fibers that contract to support the weight in <strong>Skeletal<\/strong> muscles has to be continuously provided with energy to be able to support it, and hence although no mechanical work is applied on the weight so $W=0$, nevertheless energy is wasted in the form of heat in this process, and hence we get tired after holding an object for some time.<\/p>\n\n<p>So what is the mechanism by which <strong>Skeletal<\/strong> muscles support certain weight?

It may just be in exocarp as @Ilan pointed out, but I assumed (perhaps wrongly), that the division continued through the pericarp.

Often, the ligand is a small molecule or peptide, and the thing that it binds to is a protein. On the other hand, both ligand and binding partner can certainly be proteins (or one could be a Mg$^{2+}$ ion and the other an RNA molecule, etc.). Ligand is a very broad term, and is often used in other biochemical areas aside from signaling. For example, the things that an enzyme binds to (substrates, allosteric regulators, etc) can be called its ligands. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, the things you describe in your post:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This seems contradictory to my understanding of ligands, which (I thought) are released from the cell in order to signal with cells (be it the same, neighbor, or distant cells).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>are hormones, which is a much more specific category of thing than is ligand.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Edit<\/h1>\n\n<p>There seem to be some 'ahem'... doubters as to the broadness of the definition of ligand, so, time for some examples from the literature: <\/p>\n\n<p>From the biochemistry textbook <a href=\"http://bcs.whfreeman.com/berg7e/#t_644431____\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg, 7e<\/a> (emphasis added):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The final step is affinity chromatography with the use of a <strong>ligand<\/strong> specific for the target enzyme.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From the paper <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/95/11/5942.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electrostatic steering and ionic tethering in enzyme\u2013ligand binding: Insights from simulations, Wade et al<\/a> (emphasis added):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To bind at an enzyme\u2019s active site, a <strong>ligand<\/strong> must diffuse or be transported to the enzyme\u2019s surface, and, if the binding site is buried, the ligand must diffuse through the protein to reach it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From the paper <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01590996#page-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geometries of functional group interactions in enzyme-ligand\ncomplexes: Guides for receptor modelling, Tintelnot et al<\/a> (emphasis added):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are many more examples of arginine-carboxyl interactions that appear to have key functional\n  roles in enzymes, including some in which an arginine-like structure in the <strong>ligand<\/strong> interacts\n  with a carboxyl group from the binding site (i.e., the reverse of that described above).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is true that the one particular compound that natively binds to an enzyme's active site is often called a substrate, in part to differentiate it from allosteric regulators and other ligands that can also bind to the enzyme. Thus, the set of all of an enzyme's substrates can be thought of as a subset of the enzyme's ligands. Again, ligand is an extremely broad concept that simply refers to something which binds.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Edit 2<\/h1>\n\n<p>Fun fact! The modern word ligand comes from the latin verb ligāre, meaning \"to bind\". More specifically, ligand derives from the gerundive form of ligāre, ligandus, which translates to something like \"(that which is) to be bound\". \nNot that this has much bearing on how it's used in the modern scientific literature.

The carbon group can occur in various redox states: CH3-THF (methyl-THF), CH2-THF (methylene-THF), CH-THF (methenyl-THF) or CHO-THF (formyl-THF). These can be interconverted by a variety of enzymes, and are used by cells to synthesize a number of products, including nucleotides and methionine.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>MTHFR<\/em> (methylene-THF reductase) converts CH2-THF into CH3-THF. The CH3-THF form is the most abundant folate in blood, and is therefore considered the \"transport\" form of folate. CH3-THF is also the form used to synthesize methionine, in the reaction<\/p>\n\n<p>CH3-THF + Homocysteine $\\rightarrow$ THF + Methionine<\/p>\n\n<p>catalyzed by methione synthase (gene symbol: <em>MTR<\/em>). This enzyme requires cobalamin (B12) as a cofactor. Actually, the reaction occurs in two steps,<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>CH3-THF + Cobalamin --> THF + CH3-Cobalamin<\/li>\n<li>CH3-Cobalamin + Homocysteine --> Cobalamin + Methionine<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Loss of MTHFR leads to deficiency of CH3-THF, causing methionine synthase to run out of substrate, and homocysteine to accumulate. Lack of the B12 cofactor also blocks methionine synthase, and it should be clear from the reactions above why supplementing with either CH3-THF or CH3-cobalamin can alleviate the problem (at least in theory). I would guess the phenotypes seen in this condition is mainly due to lack of methionine though, rather than excess homocystine, since methionine is required for a variety of methylation reactions in cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a simplified view. There are many other interactions between B12 and folate; for example, the methinine synthase reaction is needed for cells to take up and store folates, and therefore B12 deficiency can create a folate deficiency as well.

The heart will eventually stop beating as all bodily systems begin to stop working shortly after brain death. Remember the heart can beat, but your diaphragm and lungs wont. hence the cardiac muscles undergo asphyxiation and die off. However, immediately after death, there is enough oxygenated blood in the body to keep thing moving for a while<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Long version<\/strong>\nThere is a simple explanation why.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you know every muscle in the body has to receive stimuli from the neuromuscular junctions (and subsequently the nervous system) in order to contract. <\/p>\n\n<p>The heart is a bit different in that it is not regulated by the brain, but the regulatory mechanisms lie within the heart itself. The heart conductive system contains a special group of cells called the pace maker cells (SA node) that fire at regular intervals and cause the heart to beat.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KIWFf.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Each heart beat is triggered by an electrical pacemaker - a group of cells in the heart that have the ability to generate electrical activity. They cause electrical impulses to spread over the heart and make it contract.\n  The largest natural pacemaker of the heart is called the sinoatrial or SA node and is found in the right atrium. From it, specialised groups of cells that carry the electrical charge lead off to the rest of the heart.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(Taken from <a href=\"http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/hearthealth/howtheheartworks.htm\">here<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>The brain regulates the rate of the heart beat sure, but it does not send the signals that cause the heart to beat in itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, even after disconnection, the SA node still sends the impulse down the AV node and purkinje fibres that spread out across the cardiac musculature and cause them to contract, causing the heart to beat. This will continue for a while till they run out of energy and stop.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read more about it here:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_pacemaker\">Wiki<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":35182,"question_id":35180,"up_vote_count":23,"last_edit_date":1434218097},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93ad97cd6d264067b56ee1e08fa0b73d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":540,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/540/superbest","reputation":2283,"display_name":"Superbest","accept_rate":69},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":0,"post_id":35186,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434183254,"comment_id":56997,"body":"Can you please describe this more closer <i>a central cluster of neurons<\/i>."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1434163993,"creation_date":1434163993,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>I was wondering if a heart keeps beating if it is separated from the body?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, it does. Here's a video showing it (<strong>don't click if you're squeamish!<\/strong>): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEuSCPifKhA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEuSCPifKhA<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>It's a classical physiology experiment to remove a heart and keep it beating for some time in a jar with liquid solution. In fact, acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter to be discovered, was detected via <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chnt1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an experiment involving disembodied, still-beating frog hearts<\/a>. As a result, Otto Loewi (who conducted the experiment) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine#History\" rel=\"nofollow\">received the Nobel prize<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course it won't go on forever, as the heart eventually runs out of nutrients and air (without access to lungs). There are also other problems. Taking steps such as supplying oxygenated blood, putting the heart in an isotonic solution, ensuring stable temperature, adding adrenaline (which stimulates the heart) can extend the duration of beating.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If yes, then why?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Why not? Tissue doesn't die the moment it's removed from the body (it's not like individual cells can telepathically tell they've been cut off, they have no way of knowing). It lives for some time before nutrients are exhausted, blood in capillaries drains off, oxygen is depleted, temperature falls, desiccation occurs, and cells finally die. Note how when an accident severs body parts, they can often be surgically reattached and function normally.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most tissues don't seem to be doing much when you sever them. For instance, a severed hand won't make any movements (actually severed animal limbs can often keep on twitching) but that is because no signal is coming from the brain. If you could emulate the signal, you could get it to move before necrosis occurs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The heart has a central cluster of neurons, who's function is to generated a regular signal which causes the heart to beat. Because of this, the heart muscle continues to receive a signal even if cut out. The pacemaker cells don't keep perfect rhythm (and more over heart rate is a complicated matter), so in a normal human the brain fine-tunes the rate of beating through hormones and the vagus nerve. If you cut off the vagus connection, the beating won't be as ragular or as rapid as inside the body.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35186,"question_id":35180,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFsrH.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5755,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5755/ilan","reputation":4751,"display_name":"Ilan","accept_rate":100},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a592159aa380c054cccb3a449a9ff27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8105,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8105/rover-eye","reputation":2003,"display_name":"Rover Eye"},"score":0,"post_id":35197,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434216201,"comment_id":57034,"body":"I&#39;m sorry mate, but that is not the case.

(2) Other animals do ruin water for their own use to some extent, but their populations tend to be limited by other things first. Humans have developed technologies to work around many limits on our population density, to the point where we gained the opportunity to make fouling the water a limiting factor."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1434135481,"creation_date":1405274083,"body":"<p>I wouldn't say that a human is \"likely\" to get sick by drinking from a puddle, I'd say \"at some risk\". It isn't <em>desperately<\/em> dangerous, although don't take that as a recommendation. There are many infections you can get from water (bacterial, viral, amoebal, and I presume fungal). You don't want to risk them, but <em>probably<\/em> won't actually encounter them in that puddle in your garden you see your dog drinking from. If the water is stagnant then the list of things in it that might hurt you is longer than if it's flowing. If you can avoid the mud, and anything that's been standing long enough to grow algae, fresh rainwater is a pretty good bet as these things go.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same is true of other species, but the risk per drink is lower, since they drink it more and develop resistance to more of the things on the list. Humans are no different. For example some areas tend to have Hepatitis A in the tap water. The local population is immune after they've been infected once, and most childhood infections cause no symptoms, so it's not a problem for the locals. But to an unvaccinated visitor, the water's not safe. Hep A normally won't kill you, but is still well worth avoiding since it will make you sick for several weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p>So basically, humans drink clean water because we can, not because we absolutely need to.<\/p>\n\n<p>The lifespan of humans living \"in the wild\" (that is, populations prior to or independent of human agriculture) is pretty well agreed to be rather less than that of typical modern lifestyles. Water-borne disease is only one of many things responsible for that. The expected lifespan of a person used to purified water and so on, dropped into \"the wild\", is even lower again.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"clean-water\" problem in developing countries is primarily one of high population, relative to what the same area could possibly support in the absence of agriculture and other technology. The biggest risk of water-borne disease comes from contamination by human waste (although there are other sources, for example rats can contaminate water with Weil's disease). A small group of humans living in a large area doesn't have to worry about human contamination, they just drink upstream of where they defecate. This strategy doesn't help much once the population is dense enough that someone else is doing the same thing 20 metres away from you.<\/p>\n\n<p>And of course, human agriculture also supports a much higher rat population than would otherwise be present (they're omnivores too, so they'll eat pretty much any food humans do). I suspect most human disease can be blamed on agriculture one way or another: if not on the animals then on the close-quarters living. If the population of humans was closer to what it was in the palaeolithic (a few thousand or tens of thousands of people in Europe), and was used to drinking from natural sources, then the water would be mostly (not entirely) safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>So it's not so much that humans need perfectly clean water, it's that <strong>humans have figured out how to live in populations so large that we tend to make all the nearby water particularly dirty<\/strong>. Other species aren't completely unaffected by this, but they are <em>less<\/em> affected because our waste is specifically contaminating the water with diseases that affect us.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19644,"question_id":14794,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1434135481}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14794/are-humans-the-only-animal-that-requires-clean-water","last_activity_date":1434135481,"creation_date":1391400851,"answer_count":3,"title":"Are humans the only animal that requires \"clean water\"?","body":"<p>I've seen a number of animals - dogs, cats, squirrels, ducks and geese, etc drink from puddles, some of them were muddy, others had green flora growing under water.

It acts on the neural plate of skeletal muscles, where it activates the muscle cholinergic receptors. <\/p>\n\n<p>Phase 1 block due to succinylcholine thus occurs by activating so many receptors at once, that the whole muscle gets desensitized and therefore paralyzed. A corollary of that is that muscle will twitch during activation, thus accounting for the reason why people twitch shortly before becoming paralyzed after a succinycholine iv injection. This phase 1 block will resolve in 2-5 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now an interesting phenomenon is that if you go on stimulating the muscle with more cholinergic agonists (for example, a second iv dose of succinylcholine), you may end up provoking endocytosis and degradation of the cholinergic receptors.

It started out when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V._McConnell\">James McConnell<\/a> performed a later-discredited experiment in which he found that if you chopped up flatworms which had been exposed to some stresses, and fed them to other unexposed flatworms, the unexposed worms became wary of the source of stress quicker after eating their dead companions. He jumped to the conclusion that a 'memory molecule' was being transferred, and that the cannibal worms gained the food worms' memories of the stress.<\/p>\n\n<p>People then started looking to see if they could:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>repeat the experiments<\/li>\n<li>find the same phenomenon in other animals<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In the first case, nobody could replicate the experiments in worms, but because McConnell was such a PR genius he managed to convince the public that his results were valid (see Rilling, 1996 for more on this).<\/p>\n\n<p>In the second case, Frank et al. (1970) and others tried working with rats - I think this is the experiment you're talking about in the question. They found various interesting results including that if you trained rats to run through a maze by using particularly stressful negative reinforcement (like electrocution), then those rats' children would be able to learn the new maze much faster. However, Frank et al. didn't make the same mistake as McConnell - first of all they wondered if the parent rats might be leaving a scent trail. So they used duplicate mazes with the exact same design, putting the children into clean mazes. The children of adults who had already learned the maze continued to outperform the control rats - the explanation was not scent trails.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next they wondered whether it might be that the second generation rats had been born with a higher wariness as a result of the stress their parents suffered; i.e. it could be a hormonal transfer from mother to child (e.g. cortisol, the stress hormone).<\/p>\n\n<p>Frank et al. tested their hypothesis by torturing some rats for a while (rules about animal welfare were not strict in the 70's). They would lock some rats in a small jar and bash them about for a long time, then kill them, chop them up, and take out their livers. They fed the livers to other rats, and found that after eating the livers the other rats learned the maze much faster. They interpreted the results in what now seems a sensible light: <strong>the stressed rats were producing high concentrations of a stress-signalling molecule. When those rats either had children or were fed to other rats, they passed on high doses of the stress molecule. This raised the alterness and wariness of the receipient rats so that they were much quicker to learn which parts of the maze were dangerous.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There is no evidence that the child rats actually 'remembered' the maze - they still had to find their way around, but they were extremely wary of the electrocution plates and so avoided them, finding the safest way to the end. <strong>This is not a case of genetic memory<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.169.3943.399\"> <strong>Frank B, Stein DG, Rosen J<\/strong>. 1970.

The viscera are the internal organs. Virtually all visceral reflexes are mediated by local circuits in the brain stem or spinal cord (Fig. 1). It is one of two major subdivisions of the nervous system; the other being the somatic (or voluntary) nervous system. The main distinction between the two is that the latter is involved in voluntary and conscious actions (e.g., movement, perception and cognition), while the autonomic nervous system is engaged in <em>involuntary<\/em> processes, such as regulating heart rate, breathing and bowel function (Fig. 1). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/m5Pth.jpg\" alt=\"Autonomic nervous system\">\n<sup>Fig. 1.

Source: <a href=\"http://www.austincc.edu/apreview/PhysText/PNSefferent.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Austin Community College<\/a><\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Although by far most stimuli driving autonomous responses come from within (think muscle movements driving bowel movements, increased heart rates during physical exercise), outside stimuli do directly impinge on the autonomous system. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the cilliary muscle in the iris is under the control of light coming into the retina. The <a href=\"http://www.neuroexam.com/neuroexam/content.php?p=19\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>pupillary light reflex<\/strong><\/a> test is based on this principle, and is routinely used to diagnose damage to the visual system. Also, <strong>production of saliva<\/strong> is controlled by external stimuli (smell and taste of food and see the striking example below from @anongoodnurse). And technically, the entire digestive tract can be considered to be <em>outside<\/em> the body, as it is continuous with the skin and lining of the mouth. Hence, the mechanical stimuli impinging on the intestines by a moving bolus of food that drives the waves of <strong>peristaltic movements<\/strong> can, arguably, be considered to be caused by external stimuli too. Lastly, the fight-flight-fright response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response\" rel=\"nofollow\">(<strong>HPA) axis<\/strong><\/a> is often initiated by external stimuli (loud sudden noises etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>The most important characteristic of the autonomic nervous system, as said, is that the autonomous responses are <strong>not voluntarily controlled<\/strong>. While you can decide to look or track a visual stimulus, you cannot decide to move the bolus of food back up to your stomach, or voluntarily constrict your pupil.

Schubert and Oud (1997) speculate that the spindle axis length is fixed species specifically. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/LUCLp.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>These are confocal microscope images of dividing <em>Vicia faba<\/em> (bean) cells (Schubert and Oud, 1997). <strong>(a)<\/strong> Wild-type cell at anaphase. <strong>(b-d)<\/strong> When the chromosome arms are longer, the chromatids cannot be completely separated at anaphase. <strong>(e)<\/strong> Wild-type cell at telophase. <strong>(f, g)<\/strong> Longer chromatids cannot be separated sufficiently and a bridge forms between the two daughter nuclei. <strong>(h-j)<\/strong> The bridge is broken when the cell plate forms. <strong>(k)<\/strong> Wild-type cell at interphase. <strong>(l)<\/strong> Breaking of the bridge between cells with lengthened chromosomes creates irregularly shaped nuclei and micronuclei - these micronuclei represent loss of DNA from the genome and are eventually lost outright through further cell divisions. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Lower Limit<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There is a lower limit, but it doesn't seem that anyone knows why, which makes it impossible to accurately define.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Schubert and Oud (1997):<\/strong> Data from various eukaryotic kingdoms indicate the existence of a lower limit of chromosome size for stable mitotic and meiotic segregation. Yeast artificial chromosomes do not exhibit normal meiotic stability until they are of a size between 120 to 500 kb which comes close to the order of size of native yeast chromosomes, in addition to functional telomere and centromere sequences (Niwa et al., 1989). For a Drosophila minichromosome, an island of complex DNA of 220 kb was shown to be necessary for proper centromere function (Murphy and Karpen, 1995). However, for stable mitotic and meiotic segregation an additional 200 kb of a flanking satellite sequence was required. For stable achiasmate disjunction of minichromosomes during meiosis in female Drosophila, 1000 kb of overlapping centric heterochromatin sequences are necessary (Karpen et al., 1996). Schriever-Schwemmer and Adler (1993) have shown that a minichromosome representing the small centric product of a translocation between chromosomes 7 and 15 of the mouse and comprising about 1% of the haploid genome got lost during meiosis in the female carrier organism while the corresponding product of a translocation involving chromosomes 4 and 8 did not. The latter was somewhat larger. Either this different behavior was due to the presence of essential genetic information on the small translocation product 4\u2078, or the minichromosome 7¹\u2075 was just too small for stable segregation, although it contained a complete centromere as well as telomeres. Finally, we have observed that the frequency of meiotic missegregation, but not of transmission to the next generations, is inversely correlated with the size of translocation chromosomes in <em>Vicia faba<\/em> (Schubert et al., 1986). Thus, the existence of a proper length range for eukaryotic chromosomes is obvious.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The physical reasons for the lower limit that still enables stable mitotic and meitotic segregation are less clear at present than the constraints for an upper limit of chromosome length<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, \"present\" in that paper refers to the late 90's but, in my admittedly brief search, I have been unable to find too much in the way of more recent results.

Part of this\n  organic matter is used for plant-growth, but a large part can\u2019t be\n  used by the plant and is excreted into the soil via the roots. Around\n  the roots naturally occurring micro-organisms break down the organic\n  compounds to gain energy from. In this process, electrons are released\n  as a waste product. By providing an electrode for the micro-organisms\n  to donate their electrons to, the electrons can be harvested as\n  electricity. Research has shown that plant-growth isn\u2019t compromised by\n  harvesting electricity, so plants keep on growing while electricity is\n  concurrently produced.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aKUfU.png\" alt=\"Root energy\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently there is <a href=\"http://www.plantpower.eu\">more research here<\/a>, and this was particularly interesting (<a href=\"http://plantpower.eu/onewebmedia/Abstractboek%20Symposium%20Gent.pdf\">a PDF<\/a>) as it states more clearly that we are indeed talking about bacteria:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The PlantPower concept is based on the cooperation of plants and\n  microorganisms to produce in-situ electricity. Plants take up carbon\n  dioxide and water and capture light energy. This energy is stored in\n  the chemical bonds of sugars produced, using carbon dioxide and water.\n  Part of this chemically stored energy is transferred to the roots of\n  the plants. This energy present in the root zone can then be captured\n  by the so-called electro-chemical active bacteria. These organisms are\n  capable to oxidize the organic matter present in the root zone and\n  transfer the energy rich electrons to an electrode. The energy carried\n  by the electrons can be used as electrical energy, after which the\n  electrons react at another electrode with oxygen to form water.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to understand this process as far as what bacteria or \"micro organism(s)\" are being leveraged here.

Sequencing is just sequencing. But as for every single sequencing, there are factors to consider and protocols to be selected. \nOne important thing is, that you might want comparably long reads to cope with the repeats and the general large size of plant genomes. To get long reads, you need long input DNA sequences. Therefor you would want to follow a suitable protocol for <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC324241/\">high molecular weight plant DNA<\/a>. That might be hard, because plant DNA can be difficult to extract based on the plant and tissue you have, as most easily put you have to \"crack open\" the cell wall in the very beginning.\nAfter that, it is general sequencing. Although, as I already said you might opt for long reads (PacBio) and/or good coverage. If that is not at all feasible, you might choose to do targeted sequencing and only capture the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241023/\">whole exome<\/a> (or only the genes you are interested in) to reduce both cost and analysis complexity.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Assembly<\/strong>\nNow you have probably accumulated a lot of sequence and also potentially long sequence. There are multiple tools you could use for assembly and generally you can use the same for plants that you might want to use for example for a human genome assembly. One example that works well on large plant genomes is <a href=\"http://www.genome.umd.edu/masurca.html\">MaSuRCA<\/a>, another is <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/4/1513.abstract\">Allpaths-LG<\/a>. There are some assemblers designed to cope with long repeats, but quite often you just assemble and then try figuring out the repeat regions later, for example by improving a shotgun read assembly with long reads from another technique.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Annotation<\/strong>\nThis one definitely has specific tools for plant genomes. Well, large genomes. The main thing in annotation is finding potential genes and comparing them to databases to annotate them with function. Plants do splice and plants can have long introns, even ones including long repeats. \nOne gene prediction software example that works on plants is <a href=\"http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/\">Augustus<\/a>, but for some model organisms there are even organism-specific pipelines and tools for this task. And of course, on the database part you would choose to rely on a plant specific database (if you do not use NCBI-NR anyway). Those can also be species or genus specific like the ones you find on the <a href=\"https://www.arabidopsis.org\">TAIR<\/a> (Arapidopsis) project.<\/p>\n\n<p>TLDR:\nIt's in fact complicated. On one hand, there is a need of specific tools and databases, on the other you might go well with standard tools, but would have to adapt parameters, do additional pre- or post-processing steps and so on.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35110,"question_id":35105,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35105/how-scientists-sequence-assemble-and-annotate-plant-genomes","last_activity_date":1433987926,"creation_date":1433932504,"answer_count":1,"title":"How Scientists sequence, assemble and annotate plant genomes?","body":"<p>I previously read <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31401/why-is-it-harder-to-sequence-plant-genomes-than-animal-genomes\">this question<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.genomebiology.com/2012/13/4/243\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a> and learned good things about this topic. my current question is that scientists use which tools, algorithms, soft wares... to sequence, assemble and annotate plant genomes?\nFor each genome project do they develop new tools and algorithms or there are some tools that are useful for (almost) all genome projects?\nAre there any comprehensive site, book or paper that have plant genome sequencing and annotation protocols?  <\/p>\n","question_id":35105,"tags":["genomes","gene-annotation","sequence-assembly"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":35110,"down_vote_count":1,"closed_reason":"too broad","is_answered":true,"view_count":127,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1433987926},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl6dm.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13496/cdb","reputation":1164,"display_name":"CDB","accept_rate":100},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8338f9b96b1c61599df745d61145b0c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15878,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15878/243","reputation":959,"display_name":"243"},"score":0,"post_id":34168,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433976006,"comment_id":56817,"body":"When you take a look at Table 2 in the article, the activity to cleave RNA\u2013DNA substrates is quite low.

Theobromine is a caffeine-derivative and basically produces alertness, but also restlessness and perhaps anxiety when administered in large amounts (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>). In extremely high doses there can be LSD-like effects (<a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/547292-adverse-effects-of-raw-chocolate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">anecdotal report<\/a>). Perhaps (speculative) your girlfriend is especially sensitive. Then (E)-anethole: the late Alexander Shulgin, Godfather of MDMA, has made the etheric oils (in)famous as precursors for amphetamine synthesis. In themselves the propenylbenzenes like (E)-anethole are quite harmless, as they do not contain an amine group (a prerequisite for being called an alkaloid). However, heating (E)-anethole in the presence of ammonia may lead to the production of PMA, a compound structurally and neuropsychopharmacologically related to MDMA (<a href=\"http://www.lf1.cuni.cz/Data/files/PragueMedicalReport/PMR%2005-01%20Idle.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Idle, 2005<\/a>).

Of course some of it is sure related to being very awake and supposedly having a biorhythm that favours working in the morning, but I have always related this to not having eaten and also surprisingly not feeling hungry at all until basically deciding to eat \"because I really should eat something\" around noon.\nSo today I decided to find out, if this phenomenon is more widely known or just anecdotal for me.

Among the conditions tested were the presence of various cations (Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>, Cs<sup>+<\/sup>, Mn<sup>2+<\/sup>, K<sup>+<\/sup>, Mg<sup>2+<\/sup>), DMSO, and growth temperatures (and a few other conditions not so commonly used these days). He worked with a strain that he subsequently isolated a derivative of, called DH1, which is now available commercially as DH1-alpha and other strain derivatives.<\/p>\n\n<p>He defined transformation efficiency to be the number of transformed colonies on a plate, a measurement still used today. He found when the transforming media contained: certain cations, specifcally Mn<sup>2+<\/sup>, Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>, Rb<sup>+<\/sup>; as well as DTT, hexamine cobalt (III) and DMSO; greatly improved the transfection efficiency compared to the standard Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> treatment. He also found that sucrose and K<sup>+<\/sup> were useful, though not strictly necessary for his experimental strain. It was stated in this paper, though not explained, that sucrose acted as a stabilizer, possibly to guard against his initial use of 0°C incubation and/or freeze/thaw cycling. For the rest of his work, he did not use sucrose.<\/p>\n\n<p>Among his conclusions, he states that DTT is necessary, as well as di-valent and mono-valent cations, but that they seem to be nonspecific. In other words, there is no strict requirement for having Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>, since Mg<sup>2+<\/sup> and Mn<sup>2+<\/sup> perform equally well, nor is there a requirement for K<sup>+<\/sup>, though it's admittedly easier to use than Rb+.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are today a number of \"rich\" media broths that are available: SOB, SOC (SOB + MgCl<sub>2<\/sub> and sucrose), 2xYT, NZY+, TB, etc. All of these are superior to LB for transformation purposes because of the refined salt balance and in particular the inclusion of these di-valent and mono-valent cations. Sucrose seems to be included for the ease of metabolism and stability of the heat shock process (though I can't find a paper explicitly explaining why it is used, other than tradition).<\/p>\n\n<p>The two most common ways to transform bacteria are to have them chemically compentent (E. coli already in a rich media broth) or to electrically transform them (electroporation). The purpose of both of these is to induce holes into to cell membrane of the E. coli (chemical transformation relies on the heat shock process for this). Once these holes are made, DNA is free to enter into the bacteria. Naturally, this process is very traumatizing to the E. coli, especially since chemical transformation has the added insult of temperature shock (0°C to 42°C then back down to 0°C).<\/p>\n\n<p>Substituting LB for any rich broth, such as SOC, will greatly improve transformation yield. If a protocol calls for SOC media, and you don't have any, you may substitute for another rich media. I have used 2xYT for SOC many times quite successfully, and as I stated earlier, only the valence number for the various ions seems to matter, so just make sure they are present.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was my understanding that sucrose/glucose was added as an additional nutrient source for E. coli to expedite their recovery from the transformation protocol. I speculate that this is the case. Hanahan refers to sucrose as a stabilizer but does not define what it is stabilizing. I speculate that it acts as a cryopreservation aid and prevents ice crystal formation when undergoing cooling on ice in the heat shock method. Given the earlier bio.SE question <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/1485/389\">about shifting E. coli feedstocks<\/a>, it seems unlikely that sucrose will be used as a nutrient source in the one hour growth period immediately after transformation because that article quotes 4-12 hours as the common time range to shift metabolism from amino acids to carbohydrates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6345791\">Hanahan D.

That Abzhanov paper is interesting; it will be better when it's published and the figures released. He does a lot of evo-devo work surrounding beak development. What they did in this paper was to inhibit in chick embryos two signalling pathways (which are actually conserved amongst all animals, not just birds and reptiles) so that their expression domain more closely matched that of extant reptiles (which lack medial activation, as opposed birds). They found that doing so results in premaxillary and palatine bones which resemble ancestral archosaurs.

They will have both gained and lost information. There will be be much conservation in the same way that there is conservation between all organisms. For example, the Wnt pathway studied in this paper is conserved across all animals, from chickens to humans to placazoans to, presumably, dinosaurs.

There may not be enough precipitation to support trees that are not adapted to a drier environment, while some species of grass could survive just fine. Temperature changes could be too severe between summer and winter (grasses just go dormant or die during harsh winters, and regrow in the spring). Fire is a big issue, as well - prairies often burn, and while grasses can regrow quite quickly, a tree that doesn't mature for 20 years may not make it between fires. Grasslands also have very deep, tightly-intertwined root networks, with some reaching 15 feet (~5m) or more below the surface:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.conservationresearchinstitute.org/assets/rootsposter.enlarge.pdf\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yyyzl.gif\" alt=\"prairie root network\"><\/a>\n<sup>(Click image for higher-resolution PDF)<br />From: <a href=\"http://www.conservationresearchinstitute.org/educational-offerings.html\">http://www.conservationresearchinstitute.org/educational-offerings.html<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Tree species that survive the other challenges may not be able to penetrate deeply enough to adequately take root, sustain itself, and not fall over. Also, speaking of which, grasslands tend to be susceptible to tornadoes as well, and while grasses just bend before the wind, trees get uprooted or break. So, while any one or two of these issues may be overcome by a particular tree species, when added together it translates into a very inhospitable environment for trees.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31292,"question_id":31285,"up_vote_count":17,"last_edit_date":1429109447},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16cdc96ed6c8b436fe53f884f3123662?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12899,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12899/usf0101","reputation":69,"display_name":"USF0101"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18f18ce255fa3d3a99ed127f9a70aad5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5688,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5688/questionhang","reputation":260,"display_name":"questionhang","accept_rate":33},"score":2,"post_id":31379,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429327702,"comment_id":52727,"body":"Your answer is too general.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_euphratica\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_euphratica<\/a> is not able to survive if we plant them with large tracts of land in western Texas?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11736,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11736/jamesqf","reputation":401,"display_name":"jamesqf"},"score":0,"post_id":31379,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18f18ce255fa3d3a99ed127f9a70aad5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5688,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5688/questionhang","reputation":260,"display_name":"questionhang","accept_rate":33},"edited":false,"creation_date":1433959216,"comment_id":56801,"body":"@questionhang: Why would we want to introduce an alien species that has no obvious ornamental or food value?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18f18ce255fa3d3a99ed127f9a70aad5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5688,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5688/questionhang","reputation":260,"display_name":"questionhang","accept_rate":33},"score":1,"post_id":31379,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433988417,"comment_id":56826,"body":"@  My question is whether we should introduce them or not, but why are there no these kind of trees in Western Texas or even Africa.

Some fungi, as it is the rule among Basidiomycota, reproduce by somatogamy, i.e. the nuclei generating the zygote are from somatic cells, other than gametes. In such cases, are there species where it is necessary for the somatic cells of a homothallic mycelium to belong to a different type than the type with which they are undergoing plasmogamy?

If absolutely nothing else, elemental purification and inorganic synthesis of something chemically resembling meat in nutrition is possible. Prohibitively expensive and stupid, yes, but possible. So then the question becomes exactly how much processing you need to do. Without clear bounds on that question and inadequate research on the metabolism of obligate carnivores, nothing closer than a broad stab at an answer makes sense. That said, here's a broad stab.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, you'd probably need to synthesize <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7843559\" rel=\"nofollow\">vitamin D3<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosine\" rel=\"nofollow\">carnosine<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">DHA<\/a>, and a handful of other things from plant extract, which is possible but difficult. Carnivores often have carnosine synthases, for instance. Cats have <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/UPI0005AD04F6\" rel=\"nofollow\">two<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/UPI0003F1979B\" rel=\"nofollow\">distinct<\/a> carnosine synthases. In terms of dietary sufficiency, that may or may not be enough. To be sure, you'd have to break it down to amino acids and build it back up again, essentially. Obligate carnivores are likely to have a number of other metabolic needs that aren't met with, for instance, pulverized soybeans. You're going to need at least one vat for fermenting raw amino acids into carnosine, and probably another for vitamin D3. Seawater microalgae contain lots of DHA, so that is probably something to look into. You could oversupplement <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid\" rel=\"nofollow\">alpha-linolenic acid<\/a> instead of supplementing DHA, which might or might not work. There's not a lot of study into carnivore metabolism, so prepare to make some discoveries the hard way. Genetic studies can only take you so far, so don't try this on your favorite pet first.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short: yes, you can raise carnivores on a diet made from plants and plant material. Rhetorical you, as in it is possible. It's probably not something you can do at home, even if you're wealthy.<\/p>\n\n<p>(I'm assuming \"feeding the vegetable matter to chickens\" falls outside the domain of \"processed\" but it would be much easier than large-scale amino acid purification and fermentation.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":35037,"question_id":35032,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1433878169}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35032/can-carnivores-survive-on-a-processed-vegetarian-diet-why-or-why-not","last_activity_date":1433878169,"creation_date":1433784011,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can carnivores survive on a (processed) vegetarian diet?

The BBB is describes differences in the structure of the walls of the blood vessels of the brain, it is not a barrier to flow within the vessel, but a specialized barrier to flow out of the vessel. In many tissues the walls of capillaries (the smallest vessels) are not tightly adjoined, small molecules and even some proteins from the blood are able to pass through these minute gaps between the endothelial cells and into the tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, in the brain, these endothelial cells are tightly linked in a specialized fashion that prevents the non-specific travel of solutes between cells. Instead, molecules that cannot diffuse through the membranes of the cells must be actively transported across them (cannot leak across).<\/p>\n\n<p>An intravascular thrombus is much larger than these minute gaps, it is often considerably larger than these small vessels and becomes lodged in larger arteries, blocking flow. There is no passage through the BBB, but there is no passage of the thrombus through the walls of other capillaries in the body either. The damage caused by the infarct is due to the blockage of flow in the larger vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The circle of Willis is no magical stopping point either. Many important sites of infarct (such as the MCA middle cerebral artery), micro-infarcts in even smaller vessels can also cause difficulties.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, thrombi and the Blood-Barrier-Brain exist on different scales, the presence or absence of the BBB is irrelevant when discussing the capacity of a thrombus to occlude arteries.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35069,"question_id":15814,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15814/can-systemic-intravascular-thrombosis-cause-brain-infarction","last_activity_date":1433864463,"creation_date":1395043944,"answer_count":4,"title":"Can systemic intravascular thrombosis cause brain infarction?","body":"<p>I wonder if the thrombus can pass through the brain-blood barrier because I think small molecules like O<sub>2<\/sub>, CO<sub>2<\/sub> and ethanol can pass it.\nProbably, in some diseases where the permeability of the barrier changes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can systemic intravascular thrombosis cause brain infarction?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":15814,"tags":["cardiology","blood-circulation","pathogenesis"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":35069,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":88,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1432369382},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPiiv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14636,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14636/lanka","reputation":321,"display_name":"Lanka","accept_rate":62},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11646005668a23c7cb18912713b1235b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9215,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9215/rbarryyoung","reputation":101,"display_name":"RBarryYoung"},"score":0,"post_id":35043,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433802168,"comment_id":56602,"body":"If you were in the U.S., I&#39;d guess it was a Firefly."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oL8sQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6928,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6928/david-richerby","reputation":258,"display_name":"David Richerby"},"score":3,"post_id":35043,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11646005668a23c7cb18912713b1235b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":9215,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9215/rbarryyoung","reputation":101,"display_name":"RBarryYoung"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1433803675,"comment_id":56603,"body":"@RBarryYoung &quot;I live in Denmark, Europe&quot;, which isn&#39;t in the US."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFsrH.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5755,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5755/ilan","reputation":4751,"display_name":"Ilan","accept_rate":100},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPiiv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14636,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14636/lanka","reputation":321,"display_name":"Lanka","accept_rate":62},"score":0,"post_id":35045,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433798279,"comment_id":56596,"body":"Wow.

Residential water heaters warm up tap water typically to 120 <sup>o<\/sup>F (48 <sup>o<\/sup>C). At this temperature, the skin of adults requires an average of five minutes of exposure for a full thickness burn to occur. When the temperature of a hot liquid is increased to 140 <sup>o<\/sup>F (60 <sup>o<\/sup>C)) it takes only five seconds or less for a serious burn to occur. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and other hot beverages are usually served at <strong>160 to 180 <sup>o<\/sup>F<\/strong> (71 - 82 <sup>o<\/sup>C), resulting in almost <strong>instantaneous burns that will require surgery<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://www.ameriburn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Burn Association<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>How these numbers apply to steam I am not sure, but I think they will be comparable, given that steam is essentially made up of a dense mass of water droplets. Further, the amount of steam obviously matters. Consider these numbers: The temperature in a <a href=\"http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/steam-room-vs-sauna\" rel=\"nofollow\">sauna<\/a> typically ranges from 160-200 <sup>o<\/sup>F (71 - 93 <sup>o<\/sup>C) with a low level of humidity (ranging from 5 - 30%). <a href=\"http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/steam-room-vs-sauna\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam rooms<\/a> provide moist heat from a water-filled generator pumping steam into the enclosed room. The temperature in a steam room typically ranges from 110-114 degrees Fahrenheit (43 - 46 <sup>o<\/sup>C) with a humidity level of 100%.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There is anecdotal evidence of the Russia-born Ivan Ivanitz Chabert (<em>1792-1859<\/em>), who supposedly entered an iron oven in Paris (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y2QNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PR3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Times telescope, 1831<\/a>) with a few trays of meat, and stayed there unscathed for 5 minutes at a temperature of 380 degrees F (193 <sup>o<\/sup>C).

I'll give a try! <\/p>\n\n<p>First, the rate of evolution and rate of adaptation are two different things.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two main thing processes that quantitatively differ in populations of different sizes. 1) <em>population-wide mutation rate<\/em> and 2) <em>genetic drift<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Population-wide mutation rate<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Large populations create more mutations at each generation and therefore if the rate of evolution or the rate of adaptation is limited by the genetic variance, then one can expect large population to have higher rate of evolution and higher rate of adaptation.<\/p>\n\n<p>--> Large populations may have higher rate of evolution and higher rate of adaptation<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Genetic drift<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>However, small population have higher drift, resulting in a higher probability of fixation for new neutral (or slightly deleterious) mutations. It results that a small population will fix (fixed: frequency = 1) a higher proportions of the new mutations through time than large populations.nActually the probability of fixation of a neutral mutation is \\frac{1}{2N}. Therefore, the rate at which neutral alleles fix is $\\mu\\cdot 2N \\frac{1}{2N} = \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the mutation rate. So, the rate of fixation of neutral alleles is independent of the population size.<\/p>\n\n<p>--> Small populations have more drift but this doesn't necessarily yield to higher rate of evolution<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other and comments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Shifting balance theory<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>If adaptation is limited by the genetic architecture, that is, only mutation of very big effect on phenotype can be advantageous, then small population have the advantage to be able to accumulate slightly deleterious mutations, so that they can get off a local peak on the adaptive landscape and eventually manage to evolve toward a new higher fitness peak.<\/p>\n\n<p>--> Small population may have higher rate of adaptation<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Population-wide mutation rate <strong>vs<\/strong> genetic drift<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Weighting the relative importance of rate of production of neutral (or quasi-neutral) mutations (See <em>population-wide mutation rate<\/em> above and the probability of fixation of neutral (or quasi-neutral) mutations (See <em>Genetic drift<\/em> above) depends also on the probability distribution of mutational effects (=probability distribution of the effect on fitness of a given new mutation).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Ceteris Paribus<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The comparison between large and small populations are dependent on the state of other parameters. So even when saying all else being equal (ceteris paribus), we need to know what these other parameters are equal to, in order to answer the question because there are interactions between populations size and other parameters in explaining the rate of adaptation and rate of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other impact of population size on genetic features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Population size has many impacts on various genetic features, such as pattern of genetic diversity, distribution of per locus Fst between subpopulation, and other things. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=11794777&amp;dopt=abstractplus\" rel=\"nofollow\">This paper<\/a> is likely of interest<\/p>\n","answer_id":24069,"question_id":24055,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1433798067}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24055/how-does-rate-of-evolution-innovation-scale-with-population-size","last_activity_date":1433798067,"creation_date":1416148030,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does rate of evolution/innovation scale with population size?","body":"<p>I understand that there will be many other factors that affect rate of evolution/innovation.
