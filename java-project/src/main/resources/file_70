The genomes of humans are highly similar and in general everyone shares the same genes. <em>SNPs<\/em>, or <em>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms<\/em>, are single basepair positions in the genome in which there tend to be differences between people. This means, that instead of measuring the whole genome sequence for a person, which is very expensive and difficult, we can just examine a subset of the genome (the SNP positions) and capture most of the unique characteristics of that genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>23andMe do exactly that. They measure a large set of SNPs (but not all of them), and thus give you some useful information about your unique DNA sequence.

Additionally, it varies from person to person. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <em>effective<\/em> capture area would really depend on your application (e.g. the \"capture area\" for, say, reading text, would be narrower than the area for, say, detecting motion).<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a typical diagram for a single eye, showing just the ability to see something in that area (does not show details related to peripheral vision quality):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0zByD.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a typical diagram for both eyes combined, the solid white area is the overlap:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/LfiSe.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Both of those images are from a <a href=\"http://vision.arc.nasa.gov/personnel/al/papers/64vision/17.htm\">1964 NASA report<\/a> detailing aspects of the human visual field.

As an experiment, close one eye, stare straight ahead and hold your arms straight out to the sides. Wiggle your fingers and slowly bring your arms forward until you can just see your wiggling fingers in your peripheral vision, and you will get an idea. As an added experiment, hold a piece of paper with text on it, and repeat the same experiment until you can read the text - this region will be extremely narrow and will give you an idea of how the quality of vision changes across the field.

Also the incidences of Mangroves in the ocean away from the shoreline are of maybe a handful bunched up, hardly a species wide return to the the oceans.

Large amounts of organic biomass may exist, but iron, phosphorus, and other micronutrients are more important. A large oak can be <a href=\"http://sylva.org.uk/oneoak/tree_facts.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">15 tons<\/a>, which is harder to support using only sediment on the lakebed. It's also understandably difficult to germinate and sprout if you're an aquatic tree. See mangrove propagules for an example of the problems and how to get around them(sort of). Most mangrove species need lenticels in the trunk to provide enough oxygen, and long roots require periodic pneumatophores to provide oxygen to the roots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking at all the pressures on plant life in lakes, it's a lot of work to be a tree, and much easier to be a lilypad. More of the biomass can be concentrated on photosynthesis, and structural concerns are a lot less troublesome. Additionally, many lakes simply do not have the nitrogen or phosphorus content to support tree-sized growth. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_state_index\" rel=\"nofollow\">trophic state index<\/a> in lakes.

But the above software optimises the edge lengths, resetting the edge length to A and B to effectively 0!<\/p>\n\n<p>thanks<\/p>\n","question_id":24190,"tags":["evolution","phylogenetics","sequence-analysis"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":24199,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d00fdef2bba346a9fcab00add8798f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10286,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10286/tesyr","reputation":6,"display_name":"Tesyr"},"closed_date":1416513830,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d00fdef2bba346a9fcab00add8798f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10286,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10286/tesyr","reputation":6,"display_name":"Tesyr"},"score":0,"post_id":24193,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1416513773,"comment_id":38598,"body":"This is without current human limits of how much muscle you can use at once."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"post_id":24193,"edited":false,"creation_date":1416523163,"comment_id":38604,"body":"Exactly what do you mean with &quot;<i>limits on how much muscle you can use at once<\/i>&quot;?

The basic idea is that what we call the \"antisense\" strand is actually the one being transcribed. However, since that is in effect a mirror image, it is much simpler to think in terms of the sense strand. <\/p>\n\n<p>To take a very simple example:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>5' ATG 3' &lt;-- sense strand\n3' TAC 5' &lt;-- antisense strand\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The antisense strand will be read in a 3' to 5' direction:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>3' TAC 5' &lt;-- antisense strand\n5' AUG 3' &lt;-- mRNA\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Since the mRNA is a mirror image, it has the sequence of the sense strand. It is this mRNA that is then translated and this is read in a 5' to 3' direction. So, AUG is translated as Met. To illustrate, have a look at this image from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28biology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a> (click on it for a larger version), <\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Protein_translation.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GMIf5.gif\" alt=\"protein translation animation\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In the image above you can see the growing polypeptide (protein) chain snaking its way through the ribosome.

But I am not understanding how all other nucleotides are the same. Bear in mind that transcription reads DNA from 3'->5' and translation reads mRNA from 5'->3'.<\/p>\n\n<p>Look at this example, focusing on the 3'-TAC-5' of the antisense strand.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7zTjz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The 3'-TAC-5' codes for Tyrosine according to the DNA codon table.

This codon transcribes and translates 3'-GTA-5' -> 5'-CAU-3' -> Histidine, not Valine and not Methionine.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my questions are:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why do DNA codon tables show the correspondence between codons and amino acids in the sense strands (5'-ATG-3'), if the only way to go from ATG to Met as in the figure is to consider the antisense strand?<\/li>\n<li>I can see that the AUG codon translates to Methionine, and it is translated by reading the 3'-TAC-5' codon in antisense strand, whose corresponding codon in sense strand is 5'-ATG-3'. But this last one is read from 3'->5', so it reads 3'-GTA-5' -> 5'-CAU-3' -> His.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I am guessing I'm getting many things wrongly in this...

Often these plants have evolved features to facilitate wind catching, for example <a href=\"https://www.google.se/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dandelion%20seeds\">dandelions<\/a>.

This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal#Autochory\">Ballochory<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Water: Similarly to wind dispersal plants can spread seeds by water movement/currents, aka <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hydrochory\">Hydrochory<\/a>. This is used by many algae and water living plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sticky Seeds: There are many ways a seed can attach to the outside of an animal - by using hooks, barbs, sticky excretions, hairs. Seeds then get carried by an animal and fall off later. This is <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epizoochory\">epizoochory<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fruiting: Plants can use seed-bearing fruit to encourage animals to eat the seeds. They will then be spread when the waste is excreted after digestion. This is a process of <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/endozoochory\">endozoochory<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>More than one way to spread a seed<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>From above you can see there are many ways to spread a seed. This means that many plants (those that do not use fruit) will want (from an evolutionary perspective) to avoid being eaten at all costs, and therefore evolve poison/taste cues that reduce the frequency of this. However, if investing in producing fruit bears a net benefit, ie many seeds are spread and successfully propagate, then the cost of fruit production is not a risk. A fruiting plant can minimize the risk by limiting reward (making fruit taste good and be nutritious) to only the right spatiotemporal moment when the seeds are primed for dispersal, if the fruit is eaten before the seeds are ready/present in the fruit then there will be no benefit of producing the fruit. (I expect this is why unripe fruit doesn't tend to taste so nice - it doesn't taste nice unless it's ripe because those where mutations made fruit taste good before the seeds were ready had no offspring, and those that time the ripening well were much more successful).<\/p>\n\n<p>Producing an edible fruit is not necessarily the <em>best<\/em> way but is the way many plant species have evolved to spread their seeds. Evolution works by random mutation and selection, which can only work with the variation it has available - only if a mutation to produce fruit arises in a species and it improves fitness is it then likely to spread. <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00271.x/abstract\">It appears that endozoochory could be a very good methods of long distance dispersal<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Some interesting stuff<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"http://awesci.com/cranberry-migration/\">according to this blog post<\/a>, unripe fruits taste bitter because they are full of tanins. Cranberries are an odd fruit because they taste bitter which means they are unattractive to animals, but they do float - which is a good dispersal method - because of an air-pocket inside the fruit that evolved. It could be the case then that once a mutation arrived for the air-pocket the fruit could just float away on water to a new location, and then using resources to make the fruit sweet and tasty became an unnecessary cost so was lost (to some degree).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2010-11-benefits-bitter-cranberry-evolution-thanksgiving.html\">This article<\/a> contains this text:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like many species of plants native to North America, the cranberry is specially adapted to wetlands -- water-soaked areas that create transition points between dry land and open water. But cranberries do not grow directly in the water. Instead, they typically lay their roots at its edge, taking advantage of the rich soils created by alternating layers of peat, sand, clay and rock.\n  Other fruits are dependent on hungry creatures to spread their seed,\n  so sweetness can help their chance of being eaten and transported\n  elsewhere. Not cranberries. Because of their little air pockets, the\n  fruit falls from the plant's long vines when ripe and lets the water\n  transport it to distant beds.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This advantage dictated the fruit we eat today.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Blueberries and cranberries are close cousins and are in fact not\n  berries at all; they belong instead to a class of fruits known as\n  epigynous or false berries. Unlike a true berry, the fruit grows from\n  beneath the rest of the flower parts and as the fruit ripens the\n  flower stays attached and ripens as well.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Vorsa believes that at some point during the last ice age there were\n  fewer animals to eat the fruits, and this might have driven the two\n  species to diverge. The cranberries developed an acidity level five\n  times higher than blueberries because it came to rely on water for\n  seed dispersal. Cranberries did not need to produce large amounts of\n  sugar that their blue-colored relatives required to entice consumption\n  by animals in order to spread their seeds.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":24015,"question_id":24014,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1415997618}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24014/why-do-plants-fruit","last_activity_date":1416468703,"creation_date":1415974411,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do plants fruit?","body":"<p>This is a two-part question:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is the point of fruit if not to be eaten?

Water is essential for growth as a typical creature consists for some 70% of water. Soft-shelled porous eggs when laid on on land dry out very quickly and are prone to predation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main adaptation to reproduce on land instead of water has been the development of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion\" rel=\"nofollow\">amnion<\/a>. The amnion is basically a membrane filled with water (the amniotic sac) in which the embryo is immersed during development. Hence, you could argue that the transition to land in terms of embryonic development has never taken place, as the embryos develop in a protected aqueous environment contained within the amnion! The early <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniote\" rel=\"nofollow\">amniotes<\/a> laid eggs on land where the embryos develop, while the later ones such as humans carry their embryos/fetuses around. But early as well as late amniotes are characterized by a developing embryo immersed in a watery environment contained in the amnion.

A hard outer shell in amniotes that lay their eggs on land  helps to protect them against drying out, the harsh terrestrial environment and predators. The allantois helps to exchange and store waste products produced by the embryo, a structure not needed when eggs are immersed in water and waste products can diffuse freely through a weak and porous shell.      <\/p>\n","answer_id":24147,"question_id":24143,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1416435826}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24143/what-are-some-difficulties-animals-had-to-overcome-to-reproduce-on-land","last_activity_date":1416435826,"creation_date":1416383478,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are some difficulties animals had to overcome to reproduce on land?","body":"<p>This is for AP Biology, but the assigned textbook chapter doesn't contain any information about the question.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What are some difficulties animals had to overcome to reproduce on land? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Some disadvantages I brainstormed are<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the formation of bones\u2014need for vertical structure and support against gravity (?)<\/li>\n<li>development of lungs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Are there any more?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<\/p>\n","question_id":24143,"tags":["reproduction"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":24147,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":239,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f25900726215578f5c22fd73acd0e5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1110,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1110/gpuguy","reputation":295,"display_name":"gpuguy","accept_rate":38},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":5130,"edited":false,"creation_date":1352154689,"comment_id":7313,"body":"i think they are randomly triggered neural impulses in the retina or optical nerve."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d86534cf5207d423f528e238e4815f3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1585,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1585/jo-rijo","reputation":259,"display_name":"Jo Rijo"},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"post_id":5221,"edited":false,"creation_date":1352755558,"comment_id":7428,"body":"Wikipedia on it&#39;s own is a poor reference, try following their sources back to find something less fluid :)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d86534cf5207d423f528e238e4815f3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1585,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1585/jo-rijo","reputation":259,"display_name":"Jo Rijo"},"score":0,"post_id":5221,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TVDAK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":69,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/69/rory-m","reputation":9094,"display_name":"Rory M","accept_rate":88},"edited":false,"creation_date":1352801768,"comment_id":7434,"body":"@RoryM Ok, I don&#39;t know what you mean with &quot;something less fluid&quot; but I&#39;ve added the source that seems most complete on the subject, although that source is also based on other sources, IDK if that&#39;s ok?

Occupational safe noise levels are set at around 85 dB SPL <a href=\"http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/Documents/278/NationalStandardForOccupationalNoise_NOHSC1007-2000_PDF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Nat. Stand. Occupational Noise<\/a>). This is comparable to listening to traffic on a busy road from 10 meters away for 8 hours/day for 5 days/week (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure\" rel=\"nofollow\">see wiki on sound levels<\/a>), or a diesel truck at 15 meters going 64 km/h. If you can still talk normally, the noise cannot be much more than 60 dB SPL, which is normal conversational level (<a href=\"http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/noise_basic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">see sound chart<\/a>). So the ventilation noise is not bad for your ears as it is well below 85 dB SPL.<\/p>\n\n<p>(2) Does the noise aggravates present damage?: Similarly to the answer under (1), the noise is not loud enough to be regarded damaging even with existing hearing loss.<\/p>\n\n<p>(3) Does it cause stress? As @anongoodnurse suggested: yes it causes stress, apparently. Every unpleasant sensation will do so to a certain level.         <\/p>\n\n<p>(4) Effects of the noise on tinnitus: Typically, tinnitus is caused by hearing loss (<a href=\"http://www.tinnitus.asn.au/tinnitus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">see cause of tinnitus<\/a>) and the pitch of tinnitus often coincides with the lost frequencies (<a href=\"http://www.randombio.com/tinnitus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">see cause and effect of tinnitus<\/a>). So if your \"bad behaviors\" at youth refer to loud music, then it is probably noise-induced hearing loss that has resulted in a dip at your hearing acuity at 4 kHz (the <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857813-clinical\" rel=\"nofollow\">4-kHz notch<\/a>). In effect, the tinnitus you are experiencing will be around this frequency and therefore high-pitched. As the loudness of the ventilator is too low to cause damage, it is probably unrelated to your tinnitus. <\/p>\n","answer_id":24133,"question_id":24120,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1416370101},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1416404205,"creation_date":1416403694,"body":"<p>Noises over 75dB can cause temporary damage (temporary threshold shift), noises over 85dB can cause both temporary and permanent damage (permanent threshold shift).

For example daily 8h of 80dB is considered safe, while daily 8h of 85dB or 20mins of 100dB is considered unsafe. Tinnitus is a sign of hearing loss, so it can be both temporary and permanent.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should measure the noise levels.

So we depend on our microflora in order to protect us against pathogens by preventing them to colonize e.g. our intestines. So without a sterile environment we would die in the lack of our microflora e.g. in a C. difficile infection. In exchange we give our microbes shelter (e.g. we protect them from oxygen, UV radiation, temperature changes) and food (e.g. carbohydrates we cannot digest, for example xylitol). So the human-microbiome relationship is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_%28biology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutualism<\/a>. Some of these microbes are not detected outside of the (not necessary human) host, so these relationships can be obligate. These microbes do not only support us, but each other as well. E.g. they help each other to digest nutritients (syntrophy), so they can live in mutualism with each other as well.

However, it is relatively safe to say that it will not live forever. <\/p>\n\n<p>To be able to receive an organ transplantation, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">HLA MHC-complexes<\/a> of donor and receiver need to be matched very carefully, to limit the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection\" rel=\"nofollow\">host-vs-graft<\/a> reaction. This limits the number of possible donor-receiver patient pars drastically. So to be able to do a \"row transplantation\" (one receiver to the next and so on), they need to have matching MHC-complexes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Otherwise the immune system of the receiver turns against the transplanted organ and will eventually destroy it. To avoid this reaction, transplantation patients also receive drugs, which severely suppress their immune system, thus making other infections potentially dangerous. This reaction will still take place, since you cannot shut down the immune system of the receiver completely (for obvious reasons), though it happens at a much slower rate. Transplanted organs will only live for a certain time (see estimates from a number of transplantations below) and it is possible that people need to receive transplants twice in their life.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this reason, no doctor will put their patient at risk by giving them an organ which might have a reduced lifetime. The risk of the operation itself is also substantial.  Additionally, the original receiver needs to be dead to do this, as he would otherise need another organ in exchange.<\/p>\n\n<p>What we can do is to take the average number of a lot of transplantations together and calculate some average life-years for a transplant. According to table 2 in this paper (\"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.01021.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Life-Years Saved by a Deceased Organ Donor<\/a>\") the \"average benefit by type of transplant (life-years)\" is:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kidney: 7.2 years<\/li>\n<li>Liver: 16.9 years<\/li>\n<li>Lung: 2.1 years<\/li>\n<li>Heart: 14.5 years<\/li>\n<li>Kidney-Pancreas: 12.9 years<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These numbers are not definite, since the life style of the donor and the receiver as well as infections of the transplated patient (who has a severely suppressed immune system \u2013 this is critical) also play an important role in determining the lifetime of the organ.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24077,"question_id":24074,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1416289880}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24074/can-human-organs-be-transplanted-indefinitely","last_activity_date":1416315424,"creation_date":1416228528,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can human organs be transplanted indefinitely?","body":"<p>I watched this movie, where they rented hearts to people for a year.

She said she had no transcripts because she had been homeschooled. She looked like a teenager and acted like a one too. She even fooled her new 23 year old boyfriend. So it happens. It also happened in the Little Leagues World Series, if I remember correctly. A twenty-something guy passed himself off as a 14 year old. He was a star (for a while).<\/p>\n\n<p>In children and adolescents, the combination of a dental exam, dental films and bone X-rays can narrow a one's biological age well. Once the bones are done growing in length, that avenue is closed.<\/p>\n\n<p>After that, someone might have to provide a tooth. Chemical analysis of tooth dentin, such as aspartic acid racemization, has shown reproducible and fairly precise results.<\/p>\n\n<p>Global levels of carbon-14 (14C) have been carefully recorded over time. In one 2010 study, forty-four teeth from 41 individuals (one per individual) were analyzed \nusing aspartic acid racemization analysis of tooth crown dentin or radiocarbon analysis of enamel. Teeth from individuals with dates of birth ranging from 1936 through 1994 (aged 13\u201370 years) were analyzed, and where the date of birth was known, yielded a 14C-based <em>date of birth estimation accuracy of 1.3 years<\/em> (S.D. = 0.9 years). In one case, a date of birth was determined to be <strong>1948.4<\/strong>. In another, it was determined to be <strong>1988<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]en of these were split and subjected to both radiocarbon and racemization analysis. Combined analysis showed that the two methods correlated well (R2 = 0.66, p &lt; 0.05). <em>Radiocarbon analysis showed an excellent precision with an overall absolute error of <strong>1.0 ± 0.6 years<\/strong>.<\/em> Aspartic acid racemization also showed a good precision with an overall absolute error of 5.4 ± 4.2 years. Whereas radiocarbon analysis gives an estimated year of birth, racemization analysis indicates the chronological age of the individual at the time of (tooth extraction).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>During the course of aging, l-forms of amino acids are transformed by racemization to the d-forms. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he extent of racemization of amino acids may be used to estimate the age of various tissues. Of all stable amino acids, aspartic acid has one of the fastest racemization rates and is therefore the amino acid most commonly used for age estimation....[T]eeth are the tissue of choice for age estimation analysis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Both methods have strengths and limitations. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The radiocarbon birth dating method can tell the birth date of the person regardless of the time of (extraction).

In the case of the new growing generation of genetically\n  modified (GM) plants with stacked traits, glyphosate-based herbicides\n  (like Roundup) residues are present in the Roundup-tolerant edible\n  plants (especially corns) and mixed with modified Bt insecticidal\n  toxins that are produced by the GM plants themselves. The potential\n  side effects of these combined pesticides on human cells are\n  investigated in this work. Here we have tested for the very first time\n  Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac Bt toxins (10?ppb to 100?ppm) on the human embryonic\n  kidney cell line 293, as well as their combined actions with Roundup,\n  within 24?h, on three biomarkers of cell death: measurements of\n  mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase release by\n  membrane alterations and caspase 3/7 inductions. Cry1Ab caused cell\n  death from 100?ppm. For Cry1Ac, under such conditions, no effects were\n  detected. The Roundup tested alone from 1 to 20 000?ppm is necrotic\n  and apoptotic from 50?ppm, far below agricultural dilutions (50%\n  lethal concentration 57.5?ppm). The only measured significant combined\n  effect was that Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac reduced caspases 3/7 activations\n  induced by Roundup; this could delay the activation of apoptosis.\n  There was the same tendency for the other markers. In these results,\n  we argue that modified Bt toxins are not inert on nontarget human\n  cells, and that they can present combined side-effects with other\n  residues of pesticides specific to GM plants.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jat.2712/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cytotoxicity on human cells of Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac Bt insecticidal toxins alone or with a glyphosate-based herbicide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though GM crops promises to meet the world's food need and eliminate\n  the world hunger and starvation, the potent harmful effects cannot be\n  overlooked and these need to be taken seriously.

Extrapolating this mammalian evolution to birds would result in a creature that returns to sea, with all ties to land cut off, but that still has to incubate their eggs under water. As they would still rely on air, this is not very feasible as they would need to go up often to breath. This would leave the eggs vulnerable to predation. Even worse, it would leave the eggs at the mercy of a relatively cold ocean cooling them down quickly. Incubation means that the eggs are pretty much kept at body temperature which is difficult in the sea regardless of breathing parents. In all, while there may be certain benefits of underwater life for birds, it will require some drastic evolutionary changes in terms of the reproductive cycle. A more parsimonious way of colonizing the sea is to go back to land once and a while to lay eggs, incubate them, and raise the young until they are sea-worthy, like penguins do as @MattDMo mentioned.     <\/p>\n","answer_id":24087,"question_id":24083,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1416271323}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24083/why-are-there-no-marine-birds","last_activity_date":1416271323,"creation_date":1416261578,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why are there no marine birds?","body":"<p>Walking  by the lake and watching the ducks the other day a thought struck me; there are lots of aquatic birds but all remain at least somewhat terrestrial, nesting on land. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why is it that no birds have taken the evolutionary route of the dolphins and whales and returned to the sea?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there something in avian biology that means this is not possible?<\/p>\n","question_id":24083,"tags":["ornithology"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1416269568},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user560"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":2,"post_id":24086,"edited":false,"creation_date":1416294431,"comment_id":38369,"body":"What do you mean by validated SNP?

Therefore, sepsis and, in severe cases, septic shock, can be caused by Gram-negative bacteria through LPS-independent pathways. While it's possible that lysing these bacteria chemically by antibiotics could potentially enhance the immune response, cells like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage\" rel=\"nofollow\">macrophages<\/a> are very good at recognizing foreign invaders and lysing them on their own, giving plenty of substrates to the various receptors.

I didn&#39;t see any mention of positive blood cultures even in the patient requiring ventilatory support and dialysis (so very close to death)."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1416186697,"creation_date":1416186697,"body":"<p>all Gram negative bacteria can potentially cause septic shock, but septic shock is not limited to Gram negative cell wall lipopolysaccharides. Any infectious agent can cause septic shock, including gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungi and even viruses (this is quite evident in the recent Ebola outbreak).<sup>[1]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>The causative agents for sepsis/septic shock have evolved. Originally strongly considered to be related to Gram-negative bacteria, that is no longer the case. About 25 years ago, sepsis was considered to be a response to endotoxin thought to be relatively specific for Gram-negative bacteria. That Gram-negative bacteria were the most common causes of sepsis<sup>[2]<\/sup> resulted in trials that focused on  specific therapies for G negative endotoxins. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is now recognized that sepsis may occur from bacterial, fungal and viral organisms. More recent epidemiology studies reveal that Gram-positive bacteria have become the most common cause of sepsis in the past 25 years. According to the most recent estimates in sepsis, there are approximately 200,000 cases of Gram-positive sepsis each year, compared with approximately 150,000 cases of Gram-negative sepsis.<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Fungal causes of sepsis have also grown at a rapid pace. Why this occurs may be two-fold: a general increase in nosocomial (hospital acquired) cases of sepsis, and more effective treatment of bacterial infections, thus promoting fungal infections to a more leading role. The increase of fungal nosocomial infections has also shifted away from the common Candida albicans organism to the more recalcitrant torulopsis, glabrata and krusei subspecies.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>So while the Gram negative Lipopolysaccharide or \u201cendotoxin\u201d is unique to Gram negative bacteria, cell components of Gram positive bacteria have been identified that appear to be biologically equivalent to endotoxin in stimulating the inflammatory response associated with sepsis and septic shock. These include a peptidoglycan layer outside the cell membrane of Gram positive bacteria as well as non-peptidoglycan polymers (such as the teichoic acids). They have been shown to stimulate the release of cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1.<sup>[5]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p><sub>[1] <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/26/342451672/how-ebola-kills-you-its-not-the-virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Ebola Kills You: It's Not The Virus<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub>[2] <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2197912\" rel=\"nofollow\">Septic shock in humans.

It may be unsurprising then that cells on the inside of the 8-16 cell stage morula \ndifferentiate into ICM whereas those on the outside differentiate into trophoblast. However it is currently unclear whether this is a causal relationship (the inside-outside model) or whether blastocyst patterning is set-up earlier in cleavage (such as in the apicobasal polarity model) or if it is some combination of the two. <\/p>\n\n<p>You were correct in imagining that tissue patterning is determined by chemical substances: a very broad class called morphogens. Cells don't necessarily count how many times they have divided but cell division can certainly affect morphogen concentration and localisation. I suppose in some sense you could describe this as a clock. I wouldn't though, especially because mammalian cleavage is asynchronous. <\/p>\n\n<p>One line of studies showed that a transcription factor called Tead4 specifies trophoblast<a href=\"http://dev.biologists.org/content/134/21/3827.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">$^{ref}$<\/a>. It was then shown that Tead4 can be regulated by cell-cell contact (mediated by Hippo signalling) <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/abstract/S1534-5807(09%2900077-X\" rel=\"nofollow\">$^{ref}$<\/a>. They hypothesised that the magnitude of cell-cell contact could provide a mechanism by which Tead4 localisation could be controlled in presumptive trophoblast and ICM. This could explain why the cells have different fates because inner cells are completely surrounded (more cell junctions) whereas outer cells are largely exposed to the medium. Note that I only provided that as an example of a possible mechanism. It is not confirmed and, as with any model, the real picture is incredibly more complex and likely involves many factors. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm reluctant to go into too much detail on this because you're asking about a complex process that is still under active study and I'm unclear as to how much information you actually want.

There are more reasons than the following but the most apparent is hemoglobin production and its transport. The erythrocyte is a cell whose structure is optimal for its function-the production and transport of hemoglobin.<\/p>\n\n<p>It lacks a nucleus and organelles so that it can devote almost 100% of its energy to hemoglobin production. It has this  bi-concave disk shape to increase its surface area thus increasing the exposure of hemoglobin to oxygen and CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's a small and flexible cell allowing them to easily maneuver the capillaries (where they work). <\/p>\n\n<p>Because it's anuclear it has a short lifespan but they are rapidly produced and regulated by erythropoietin.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order for tissues to receive oxygen and rid themselves of carbon dioxide there needs to be an orderly transfer and movement of hemoglobin from the tissues to the lungs and back-and-forth. Without this cycling of hemoglobin on the erythrocyte the protein would move more in the body through diffusive means.

First, for a question like this it is useful to look at other solutions to the same problem. For instance, the second most common molecule for oxygen transport is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hemocyanin<\/a>, and this is not bound to cells but is directly suspended in hemolymph (arthropod/mollusc \"blood\"). So specialized cell types for oxygen transport is not a necessity for effecient oxygen transport in rather advanced organsism. So your question; \"<em>why do we need cells packed with hemoglobin: why can't it travel freely in the bloodstream?<\/em>\", while being true for humans and other vertebrates, is not true for oxygen transport in all \"complex\" animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, while there seems to be good reasons for why hemoglobin is bound in RBC, you should at least entertain the idea that the cause of RBC-bound hemoglobin in vertebrates is an evolutionary contingency (i.e. a random historical event). Evolution is always constrained by previous evolutionary history, and the reason that all vertebrates (+ a number of other organsisms) share RBC-bound hemoglobin may simply be that they share a common ancestor. This does not mean that it lacks advantages, but it also means that it might be misleading to search for <strong>the<\/strong> reason for RBC-bound hemoglobin in a particular species.

Therefore, just by simple logic, it would appear likely that males have greater variance in mating success (strong/attractive males would be able to mate with many females while weak/unattractive males would have little to no offspring).

This can happen if the bowel moves and so raises the core temperature.

This can be due to food allergy or, in a milder form, in food intolerances which are quite common. When it comes to sour ingredients, they are often in fruits, so I'll make a shot in the blue and say that you have a food intolerance against some fruits.

Simply mix the appropriate amount of sample buffer with your sample and load it. For a 2x sample buffer use equal amounts of sample and buffer, for 5x sample buffer use 4 parts of sample and 1 part of buffer (for examle 40µl + 10µl). Heat the mixed samples for 5 minutes at 95°C, cool them immediately on ice and load an appropriate amount of it on the gel. How much is possible really depends on the type of gel you use - 20-30µl should usually be possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do not load too much protein, otherwise you will not be able to seperate them appropriately. I usually use between 20-30µg of total protein per well or as little as 50ng for purified proteins (this depends on the antibodies as well).<\/p>\n\n<p>Have a look on this <a href=\"http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/studies/sds-page/gellab2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage<\/a> for some further information.<\/p>\n\n<p>For sample buffers I usually use the following recipes. I prefer the 5x, because I can load more protein, if the preparation is not very good. I also prefer the use of DTT to Mercaptoethanol, as it is much less smelly. If you have no DTT (or prefer mercaptoethanol) it can be replaced by an equal amount (200mM in the 2x, 500mM in the 5x buffer). If you use DTT, you need to make aliquots of the buffer and store it at -20°C, a working aliquot can be kept at 4°C for two weeks or so.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2x sample buffer:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4% SDS<\/li>\n<li>20% glycerol<\/li>\n<li>100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8<\/li>\n<li>2 mM EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid)<\/li>\n<li>200 mM DTT (dithiothreitol)<\/li>\n<li>0.1 % (w/v) bromphenol blue dye<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>5x sample buffer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>10% SDS<\/li>\n<li>50% glycerol<\/li>\n<li>250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8<\/li>\n<li>5 mM EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid)<\/li>\n<li>200 mM DTT (dithiothreitol)<\/li>\n<li>0.25 % (w/v) bromphenol blue dye<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":24008,"question_id":23983,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1415968064}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23983/how-to-prepare-sample-for-sds-page","last_activity_date":1415968064,"creation_date":1415899519,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to prepare sample for SDS PAGE?","body":"<p>I usually take my protein sample 0.8ml and sample buffer(2X) 0.2ml for my sample preparation in SDS PAGE.

None of the HSPs pass that threshold. What's more, since you're working with proteins, there are no splicing issues involved and you should be able to get a single HSP spanning most of the query and subject sequences. Assuming, of course, you have a true homolog.<\/p>\n\n<p>In your output, I see many small, overlapping HSPs, most of which have low identity. I can't be sure without seeing the sequence but it's a safe bet that what you have there are low complexity/repetitive regions and that's why you have so many separate HSPs. The only half way decent one starts at position 630 of the query sequence and is only 595 residues long, less than half your query protein. Either you have a very diverged N-terminal region or your HSP is just a conserved domain. Again, I would need to see the actual sequence alignment to be sure but that doesn't look like a true homolog (assuming your species are reasonably close which they must be if you're using a 90% identity threshold).<\/p>\n\n<p>So, always assuming that your species are close enough to expect decent homologs, I would simply ignore the shorter HSPs and deal with those that represent more than, say, 80% of my query's length at >=90% identity.

For\n  instance, viral IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) interact with and\n  inhibit the processed active caspases, either by blocking the\n  catalytic part of the enzymes, or through E3 ubiquitin ligase activity\n  from RING domains, targeting caspases for rapid degradation via\n  proteasome. Baculoviruses, asfiviruses or irridescent viruses encode\n  such IAPs. Another class of caspase inhibitors frequently found among\n  poxviruses include the serine proteinase inhibitors serpins:\n  CrmA/SPI-2. Crma targets cysteine proteases such as host Caspase 1 and\n  Caspase 8.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>viralzone - <a href=\"http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/912.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inhibition of host caspases by virus<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pathogens specifically target both the caspase 8-dependent apoptotic\n  cell death pathway and the necrotic cell death pathway that is\n  dependent on receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; also known as\n  RIPK1) and RIP3 (also known as RIPK3). The fundamental co-regulation\n  of these two cell death pathways emerged when the midgestational death\n  of mice deficient in FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) or\n  caspase 8 was reversed by elimination of RIP1 or RIP3, indicating a\n  far more entwined relationship than previously appreciated. Thus,\n  mammals require caspase 8 activity during embryogenesis to suppress\n  the kinases RIP1 and RIP3 as part of the dialogue between two distinct\n  cell death processes that together fulfil reinforcing roles in the\n  host defence against intracellular pathogens such as herpesviruses.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The MCMV protein vICA prevents caspase 8 activation, and this\n  sensitizes cells to death receptor-induced necroptosis. In addition,\n  the MCMV protein vIRA blocks necroptosis and MCMV-induced programmed\n  necrosis by inhibiting RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction\n  motif)-dependent interactions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v12/n2/fig_tab/nri3131_F2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Viral infection and the evolution of caspase 8-regulated apoptotic and necrotic death pathways<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One potential explanation for this is that this form of death evolved\n  to provide a \u201cbackup\u201d pathway. Indeed, cowpox virus produces the\n  factor CrmA, a potent apical caspase inhibitor capable of blocking\n  apoptosis (Ray et al., 1992; Gagliardini et al., 1994). Several viral\n  encoded genes are similarly produced to prevent apoptosis, and thus it\n  is clear that inhibition of apoptosis is an important means viruses\n  have exploited to avoid immune clearance. Interestingly,\n  cytomegalovirus induces RIP3-mediated necroptosis via the interferon\n  regulatory factor DAI (Upton et al., 2012). This virus also produces a\n  protein called viRA, a protein that disrupts assembly of RIP1/RIP3\n  necrosomes and consequent necroptosis. Thus, while the physiological\n  function(s) of necroptosis remains to be fully elaborated, it is clear\n  that this cellular process has been around for a long time during\n  evolution. It is likely that necroptosis may serve as an \u201cAchille's\n  heel\u201d in tumor cells, and thus greater understanding of the process\n  may reveal novel therapies for cancer therapeutics.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2014 - <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fcell.2014.00003/full#h3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grand challenges in cell death and survival: apoptosis vs. necroptosis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It seems like there is a 3rd pathway too, it is called ferroptosis.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>TNF-induced necroptosis depends on receptor-interacting protein-1\n  kinase, mitochondrial complex I and cytosolic phospholipase A2\n  activities, whereas H2O2-induced necrosis requires iron-dependent\n  Fenton reactions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v17/n6/abs/cdd2009184a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Necroptosis, necrosis and secondary necrosis converge on similar cellular disintegration features<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The transition metal iron is essential for life, yet potentially toxic\n  iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unavoidable in an\n  oxygen-rich environment.

I don&#39;t know fo any studies, but will be interested in others answers!"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f722bada5cd21fbca67a3dda09749dc3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1906,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1906/atticus29","reputation":482,"display_name":"Atticus29","accept_rate":43},"score":1,"post_id":2814,"edited":false,"creation_date":1360053702,"comment_id":8634,"body":"Is a Fisher&#39;s exact test (a chi-squared test with more relaxed assumptions) something you&#39;ve considered?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4dded251881d6c2e6195d81cfc465e35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5006,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5006/adam-r","reputation":237,"display_name":"adam.r"},"score":0,"post_id":2814,"edited":false,"creation_date":1385926885,"comment_id":17952,"body":"I actually don&#39;t understand what the hypothesis is.

If they diverged a long time ago, then we can assume the SNPs that show up in your hypothetical GWAS are indeed independently associated with the disease.  However, it&#39;s not strictly possible for the same SNP to occur in another gene, it&#39;s sort of by definition a different SNP.  As GWAS methods generate correlations, not causations, if those same-but-different SNPs are associated with the disease, that&#39;s the end of the story.
