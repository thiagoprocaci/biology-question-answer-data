The new generations of antivenoms described have the Fc portion of the antibodies removed.  This eliminates the adverse immune reaction but I also think also eliminates any immune resistance the patient might get out of the antisera.  The Fc portion of the antibody is the part which our immune cells bind to.  In this case the new antivenoms aren't anti sera exactly, but they do use the antibodies to deactivate the venom toxins and crosslink them to make them less effective.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":5609,"question_id":5608,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1358293341}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5608/why-does-not-the-host-produce-any-immune-response-to-antiserum-antibodies","last_activity_date":1358293341,"creation_date":1356786712,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does not the host produce any immune response to antiserum antibodies?","body":"<p>When an antiserum is injected to a person to protect oneself from a certain disease, the antibodies in the antiserum come from another organism.

For example, try to find high- and low-expressing cell lines, load equal amounts, and see if there is a difference in signal at the expected molecular weight. Check the company's literature or contact their technical support to see if they have tested the antibody by immunofluorescence (IF), and if so what their results were and how they validated them. Check the literature to see if other people have published with this product. <a href=\"http://highwire.stanford.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://highwire.stanford.edu<\/a> is a pretty good full-text search engine, but they don't have all journals in their database. Google Scholar can help, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also use your high- and low-expressing cell lines to see if there is a stronger IF signal in the high-expressing line. Look at your images to see if the signal is localizing where you expect it to, and do co-staining with antibodies to other proteins that should co-localize with your target of interest. For example, if your target is expected to localize to mitochondria, co-stain with COX-IV. A quick Google search found this <a href=\"http://www.cellsignal.com/products/4753.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cellular Localization IF Antibody Sampler Kit<\/a> that has controls for several different organelles and other specific locations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make sure you are following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Don't crank the gain up too high on the scope, because non-specific background goes up, too. Look at the induction of signal between high- and low-expressing cell lines. Generally you would want at least a 2-3 fold shift, especially if you see a strong change in signal intensity by Western. Try using siRNA or similar silencing technology to knock down the signal in your cells, and validate using Western and IF.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, you can never be absolutely 100% certain that an antibody is binding a certain target, and <strong>only<\/strong> that target, but you can accumulate a lot of evidence to show that it is likely. Try to put yourself in the mindset of a reviewer, and objectively convince yourself that the signal is real. If you can't, then shop around and try something else.

A correlation that has been found (in mice) is the presence of a hormone called beta-endorphin, which is attributed to positive affect (a boost in mood). Exercising mice that demonstrated the presence of beta-endorphin in their hippocampal region did experience exercise-induced neurogenesis, while those that naturally lacked beta-endorphin did not experience neurogenesis. <\/p>\n\n<p>The basic worth of circulation should not be overlooked, either. Anything that gets your blood pumping more efficiently means that the more distal parts of the body will appreciate an influx of nutrients. A smoker with poor circulation (as a result of lowered oxygen in the blood -- carbon monoxide competes for hemoglobin-binding) will have cold hands and brittle fingernails, and this is just a simple example of this phenomenon. The value of increased circulation to the brain shouldn't be overlooked -- the blood is our main transportation system, and the brain gets nothing that is not delivered via circulation.

Muscle tissues are torn and damaged by exercise, but the body recognizes that it must need these resources (because of some present danger in the environment that caused you to run/strain yourself) so you begin to see the typical skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The heart is also made stronger through this strain, which is why regular exercisers have a lower resting heart rate -- it takes their heart less effort to pump the same amount of blood.   <\/p>\n","answer_id":5789,"question_id":5761,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5761/effects-of-exercise-on-the-brain","last_activity_date":1358115934,"creation_date":1357934467,"answer_count":2,"title":"Effects of exercise on the brain","body":"<p>I am well aware of the phenomenon of neurogenesis induced by exercise, as well as the dopamine release that results from exercise.

They do have some elastic fascia however their expansion is passive. The change is mainly as a result of the diaphragm contracting to become flatter, increasing the space that the lungs can occupy.  The external intercostal muscles also raise the ribs (in adults) which further allows for inspiration.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ytl0k.jpg\" alt=\"Figure One: Inspiration and Expiration(1)\">\n<sup>Figure One: Inspiration and Expiration<sup>(1)<\/sup>.  <em>\"Rib muscles\" refers to the external intercostal muscles<\/em>.<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>With that being said, the value I think you are looking for is <strong>peak expiratory flow<\/strong>.  Peak flow is a common medical measurement that is often taken in the management of patients with respiratory conditions, either as part of their management plan or acute assessment.  Peak flow is a measurement of the maximum speed that a person can exhale at.   <\/p>\n\n<p>As the comments on your question suggest, this varies <em>dramatically<\/em> between person to person.  Ignoring any pathologies - such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) or nerve damage to the diaphragm/intercostal muscles - peak expiratory flow varies primarily with <strong>age<\/strong>, <strong>gender<\/strong> and <strong>height<\/strong>.  These variations are summarised in charts of expected peak flow that are used, amongst other things, to grade the severity of an asthma attack (and consequently how aggressively to manage it).  Charts resemble the following:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wnXqb.png\" alt=\"Image Two: Peak expiratory flow expected value chart using the EU Scale\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sup>Figure Two: Normal values for peak expiratory flow used in UK hospitals - The EU Scale <sup>(2)<\/sup><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>So if you pick the height, gender and age that you feel is appropriate for your question, you can then read off peak flow in litres per minute.

A portion of the hepatitis B virus gene, coding for HBsAg, is cloned into yeast and the vaccine for hepatitis B is produced from cultures of this recombinant yeast strain according to methods developed in the Merck Research Laboratories.\n  Two formulations are available:\n   \u2022  10 µg/1.0 mL formulation: each 1.0 mL dose contains 10 µg of hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed onto approximately 0.5 mg of amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate;\n   \u2022  40 µg/1.0 mL formulation: each 1.0 mL dose contains 40 µg of hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed onto approximately 0.5 mg of amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate;\n  Thimerosal (mercury derivative) 1:20,000 (50 µg/mL) has been added only to the preservative-containing formulations. All preparations have been treated with formaldehyde prior to adsorption onto amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate. The vaccine is of the adw subtype.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As explained in   Exley, C. <em>et al<\/em>. (2010) The immunobiology of aluminium adjuvants: how do they really work? Trends in Immunology, 31:103-109:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The vaccine preparation is primarily micrometer-sized clusters of nano-sized primary particles of the aluminium salt with which the antigen is associated by adsorption and entrapment. The avidity with which the adjuvant associates with the antigen will depend upon multiple factors, including the form of aluminium salt (usually oxyhydroxide or hydroxyphosphate), the physico-chemical properties of the antigen (including its overall charge and molecular weight), the mode of preparation of the antigen-adjuvant complex (for example, ratio of adjuvant to antigen), and the final solution pH. The latter will usually be around neutral (pH 7.0 +/-0.5), and, along with the highly super-saturated state of the aluminium salt, this will ensure that the concentration of soluble aluminium in the vaccine preparation remains below ca 2 mM. Similarly, there will be a variable proportion of antigen, often &lt;1% of the total antigen load, that is not associated directly with the adjuvant, and some of this \u2018free\u2019 antigen may also be in a complex with aluminium., what this means is that the protein antigen is not soluble in the vaccine, but rather is adsorbed and/or entrapped in the inorganic particulate material. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What this means is that the protein antigen is not soluble in the vaccine, but rather is adsorbed and/or entrapped in the inorganic particulate material. The antigen itself has of course already been extensively purified before being incorporated into the vaccine, so the task of purifying the antigen from the Recombivax vaccine is one of releasing it from the inorganic adjuvant. The obvious thing to try first would be to isolate the particulate material by centrifugation, and then attempt to release the antigen from this in a soluble form: things to try would be extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, and detergents. SDS-PAGE would be used to monitor how much was released by these treatments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the example that I gave above (Recombivax HB) is fairly straightforward because it contains a single protein antigen.

However, <strong>I am not a licensed physician and you should consult a physician before pursuing any sort of treatments!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Rh factor is the presence of surface proteins on Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells or \"RBC\"). If Leukocytes (White Blood Cells - most commonly reported as \"T-cells\") encounter Erythrocytes that <em>do not share<\/em> the Rh factor of their host, then they can develop <em>antibodies<\/em> to it - which help identify Antigens (foreign proteins and molecules). Once the Antibodies have been generated the Immune System can attack any foreign Erythrocytes. <\/p>\n\n<p>In this way, the mother's Immune System can actually attack the RBCs of her child.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can find out more here: <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/rh.html\">http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/rh.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>And a few select quotations:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rh incompatibility usually isn't a problem if it's the mother's <strong>first<\/strong> pregnancy because, unless there's some sort of abnormality, the fetus's blood does not normally enter the mother's circulatory system during the course of the pregnancy...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...Other ways Rh-negative pregnant women can be exposed to the Rh protein that might cause antibody production include blood transfusions with Rh-positive blood, <strong>miscarriage<\/strong>, and ectopic pregnancy...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...Rh antibodies are harmless until the mother's second or later pregnancies. If she is ever carrying another Rh-positive child, her Rh antibodies will recognize the Rh proteins on the surface of the baby's blood cells as foreign, and pass into the baby's bloodstream and attack those cells. <strong>This can lead to swelling and rupture of the baby's RBCs. A baby's blood count can get dangerously low when this condition, known as hemolytic or Rh disease of the newborn, occurs.*<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And you are correct that there is a treatment via injection, but the Doctor is also correct in that administering it past the first pregnancy does little for future fetuses:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, when a woman with the potential to develop Rh incompatibility is pregnant, doctors administer a series of two Rh immune-globulin shots during her first pregnancy. The first shot is given around the 28th week of pregnancy and the second within 72 hours after giving birth. Rh immune-globulin acts like a vaccine, preventing the mother's body from producing any potentially dangerous Rh antibodies that can cause serious complications in the newborn or complicate any future pregnancies.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And the ultimate effects of missing the shots and having very unfortunate luck:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rh incompatibility rarely causes complications in a first pregnancy and does not affect the health of the mother. But Rh antibodies that develop during subsequent pregnancies can be potentially dangerous to mother and child. Rh disease can result in severe anemia, jaundice, brain damage, and heart failure in a newborn. <strong>In extreme cases, it can cause the death of the fetus because too many RBCs have been destroyed.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a cure?<\/strong> No. Once the antibodies have been developed, the Rh(+) protein is <em>known<\/em> to the mother's Immune System.

The underlying \"stump\" then generates a de-differentiated mass of cells from normal tissue. In most cases, these cells will express genes that are vital to the proper formation of limbs, such as HOX genes. This \"lump\" of cells at the stump of the wound are typically referred to as a blastema. Basically, the blastema continues to grow and regenerate the limb in a way similar to fetal growth. Though mammals (including humans) also have some regenerative capabilities, they are much more limited. In addition, many regenerated limbs will also be mildly deformed (square fingernails). In axolotl salamanders, it was found that certain retrotransposons, such as the LINE-1 element, were prevented from \"jumping\" around in the developing blastema during limb regeneration. The two active proteins PL1 and PL2 were responsible for inhibiting the activity of LINE-1 and other such retrotransposons. Active retrotransposons can potentially rearrange the genes in germ cells can be detrimental to the mechanisms that allow the blastema to replicate and differentiate, so the PL2 and PL1 proteins play a vital role in their regenerative capabilities. When the PL2 and PL1 proteins were \"switched off\" in certain axolotl salamanders, their regeneration was much less efficient. Since mammals lack the PL1 and PL2 proteins and have a different LINE-1 retrotransposon, they have reduced regenerative capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:<\/p>\n\n<p>Wei Zhu, Dwight Kuo, Jason Nathanson, Akira Satoh, Gerald M.

There are quite a few references in the bibliography here to previous systems. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, it needs sunlight, but all the elements are recycled.  Its really closed and has reasonable endurance.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The basic commercial version of his closed world -- sold under the label of \"Ecosphere\" -- is a glass globe about the size of a large grapefruit. My world #58262 was one of these. Completely sealed inside the transparent ball were four tiny brine shrimp, a feathery mass of meadowgreen algae draped on a twig of coral, and microbes in the invisible millions. A bit of sand sat on the bottom. No air, water, or any other material entered or exited the globe. The thing ate only sunlight.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The oldest living Hanson-world so far is ten years old; that's as long as they have been manufactured. That's surprising since the average life-span of the shrimp swimming inside was thought to be about five years. Getting them to reproduce in their closed world has been problematic, although researchers know of no reason why they could not go on replicating forever. Individual shrimp and algae cells die, of course. What \"lives forever\" is the collective life, the aggregate life of a community.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this is a real subject of research for those interested in creating entirely useful ecosystems.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It turns out that ecospheres scale up well. A huge commercial Ecosphere can weigh in at 200 liters. That's about the volume of a large garbage can -- so big you can't reach your arms around it. Inside a stunning 30-inch-diameter glass globe, shrimp paddle between fronds of algae. But instead of the usual three or four spore-eating shrimp, the giant Ecosphere holds 3,000. It's a tiny moon with its own inhabitants. Here, the law of large numbers takes hold; more is different. More individual lives make the ecosystem more resilient. The larger an Ecosphere is, the longer it takes to stabilize, and the harder it is to kill it. But once in gear, the collective give and take of a vivisystem takes root and persists.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately larger systems that can support people have not been made yet.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Algae and man lasted a whole day. For about 24 hours, man breathed into algae and algae breathed into man. Then the staleness of the air drove Shepelev out. The oxygen content initially produced by the algae plummeted rapidly by the close of the first day. In the final hour when Shepelev cracked open the sealed door to clamber out, his colleagues were bowled over by the revolting stench in his cabin. Carbon dioxide and oxygen had traded harmoniously, but other gases, such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia, given off by algae and Shepelev himself, had gradually fouled the air. Like the mythological happy frog in slowly boiling water, Shepelev had not noticed the stink.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is an <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=tnas\">academic reference<\/a> you can use to start looking around if you like... <\/p>\n","answer_id":5673,"question_id":5656,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5656/are-there-known-minimal-marine-ecosystems-that-are-stable","last_activity_date":1357331599,"creation_date":1357257740,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there known minimal marine ecosystems that are stable?","body":"<p>A more entertaining phrasing of the question would be \"what would a marine ecologist put into a perfect aquarium?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>I was reading about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prochlorococcus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prochlorococcus<\/a>, among other photoautotrophs, and found that they seem to get their nitrogen from ammonia, which must be produced by some other organism.

As I suspected, the hypothalmus is pretty central to temperature regulation. I had forgotten about the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in responding to environmental temperatures, which, now that I think about it, makes some amount of sense, but is still pretty interesting. It appears that there's a difference in the specific circuitry and neurotransmitters used in responding to warm and cold temperature (especially GABA v. 5-HT), so I think a reasonable hypothesis regarding the basis of individual differences in the perceived temperature of an external environment might be differences in peripheral 5-HT systems (in addition to differences in body composition). Perhaps someone with a background in the peripheral nervous system could speak to this better than I can, but single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to differences in central 5-HT systems has been an active area of research in the neuroscience community of late (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.biomedsearch.com/attachments/00/20/18/78/20187845/UPS-0300-9734-115-002.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nordquist &amp; Oreland, 2010<\/a>, <a href=\"http://depressziostop.magtud.hu/rhimmer_zoltan/Gonda%20et%20al,%20Psychopharmacol%202010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gonda et al., 2010<\/a>), which I think lends some face validity to this idea.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/N18YC.png\" alt=\"Nakamura, 2011; Figure 1\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":5653,"question_id":5631,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1357234192}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5631/neuroscience-of-temperature-regulation-and-perception","last_activity_date":1357234192,"creation_date":1357099160,"answer_count":1,"title":"Neuroscience of temperature regulation and perception","body":"<p>The hypothalamus is known to be important in the regulation of body temperature, but I'm curious whether anyone knows about the neurocircuitry of perceived temperature.

It is well known that puffer fish have reduced genomes and that this is largely due to the presence of much smaller introns, although the number and positioning of these introns is broadly similar to what is seen in other vertebrates. One classic example of this is the huntingtin gene which is 7.5 times shorter in pufferfish than in humans even though both genes have 67 introns. In fact the average fish genome size is 5-6 times bigger than that for pufferfish (zebrafish is around this average value).<\/p>\n\n<p>Although ENCODE are defining intronic DNA as functional I don't think that they are claiming a specific function for each and every intron, let alone each base in those introns.

This is not a perfect representation of the process (since at time point 2 you may actually have both $S_0$ and $S_1$ cells), but it emphasizes the point that although the DNA sequence \"computes\" the next step it is in fact constant, and the point that each cellular state dictates the next state.

I had assumed the answer was what <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/3897/1306\">rwst suggests<\/a> or something to do with osmotic pressure. It seems that we don't really know that well. <\/p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=1998708\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper from 1991<\/a>, Chi and Wu suggest the following possible mechanisms :<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Membrane fusion during the shedding of exovesicles might produce a transient decrease of the permeability barrier. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Increase of lipid dynamics by the alcohol could decrease the packing of the\nbilayer. The membrane barrier behaves like a soft polymer, which can sieve solutes. The meshes in the polymer might become larger if its packing density is\nreduced. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lateral phase separation of lipids could induce packing defects in the lipid domain. This has been observed for long chain alcohols and postulated to be responsible for the increase of membrane permeability by amphiphiles. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Increase of the dielectric constant of the membrane by the alcohol would also increase the partition of hydrophilic solutes into the membranes. Such an increase has been postulated to be responsible for the increase of the permeability by aliphatic alcohols.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Modification of the intrinsic membrane domain might follow modification of the membrane skeleton by the alcohol. Accordingly, aggregation of intrinsic proteins might cause membrane modification mentioned under point 2 to 4.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The authors state that it is not possible to decide between the\nvarious possibilities, but they seem to prefer point 5:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although it is not possible to decide between the various\n  possibilities from the present data, we showed that the\n  release of membrane fragments from ethanol-treated RBC was not a\n  requirement for the creation of membrane pores since it occurred at a\n  time much later than the detection of K ÷ leakage. In addition, we\n  found that changes of membane rheological properties preceded the\n  permeability increase. These properties have been related to\n  the membrane skeletal protein spectrin. Moreover, ethanol has\n  been shown to affect the skeleton. The processes leading to\n  the formation of pores in ethanol-treated RBC may thus relate to a\n  deranged cytoskeletal network, followed by the aforementioned\n  alteration of membrane properties.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The plot thickens, apparently, low concentrations of alcohol protect erythrocytes from hemolysis while higher concentrations can cause it. The following are extracts from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10446301\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tyulina <em>et al<\/em><\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The seeming paradox between the direct haemolytic effect of ethanol on\n  erythrocytes (Fig. 1) and the stabilizing effect of ethanol on\n  erythrocytes undergoing NaOCl-induced haemolysis (Fig. 2) could be\n  explained by the relatively small destabilizing effect of ethanol\n  which is observed (&lt;1% haemolysis) over 16 h. This effect would be\n  negligible in the short time period (generally &lt;10 min) assay for\n  NaOCl-induced haemolysis where 100% of the cells are haemolysed. An\n  alternative explanation for this paradox is that the mechanisms of\n  haemolysis induced by ethanol and NaOCl are different. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It therefore appears that ethanol does not induce significant\n  oxidative stress in the human erythrocyte, and these data are in\n  agreement with previous studies (Seeman et al., 1971), in which it was\n  found that low ethanol concentrations could protect erythrocytes\n  against haemolysis. Although the mechanism for this protective effect\n  is unknown, it has previously been suggested (Halliwell and\n  Gutteridge, 1999) that ethanol can serve as a hydrogen donor in the\n  elimination of the hydroxyl radical with formation of water and the\n  2-hydroxyethyl radical. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The authors then state (emphasis mine):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In summary, we conclude that the damage to erythrocytes which occurs\n  on in vitro exposure to ethanol <strong>may be caused, at least in part, by\n  unmetabolized ethanol directly<\/strong>, rather than by the oxidation of\n  ethanol to acetaldehyde or its conversion to FAEE.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I would guess this \"direct effect\" is something very much like what rwst suggested but the fact that the authors, who clearly work in this field, do not say so makes me think that the situation is more complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in conclusion, the exact details of alcohol's hemolytic properties don't seem to be understood in great detail.

Hence \u2018bone conduction\u2019 must have a cause other than the deformation of the rigid petrous bone that forms the cochlear bony envelope.<\/p>\n\n<p>The physiological structure data: <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 The walls of the cochlear envelope are extremely rigid. Hardly compliant to not compliant at all. So bone conduction based on deformation of that envelope is not possible. <\/p>\n\n<p>I assume that it is clear, without further explanation that the petrous bone can be regarded as a non-deformable body when confronted with the extremely weak impact of acoustic signals.  We see that for a completely normal 60 dB SPL sound pressure signal, clearly showing that the vibrations of bone in the cochlea offer only extremely small, and therefore completely negligible contributions.  It means that we are talking about deformations which is therefore completely negligible as a possible mechanism for signal transfer. I dare say, no waving arm statements.  Contributions that all result in deformations comparable to an incredibly small fraction, are all leading to naught, one cannot escape the conclusion that there must be another cause for the phenomenon of bone conduction. <\/p>\n\n<p>Bone conducted signals are considered to be evoked by the perilymph fluid moving back and forth out of the cerebrospinal cavity, via the cochlear aqueduct, towards the scala tympani. And not by mechanical deformation of the cochlea. <\/p>\n\n<p>pp: 47: It has been established that the rigid cochlear envelope is hardly deformable. This leads to the realistic hypothesis that the \u2018bone conducted\u2019 sound signals evoke stimuli by means of a similar process to those of the airborne sound stimuli, namely by means of a push-pull movement of the perilymph, in this case, out of the cerebrospinal cavity via the cochlear aqueduct.<\/p>\n\n<p>pp: 19-21: Bone conduction: As the petrous bone is the toughest bone in the human body, it is practically impossible for deformation to occur through the vibrating movements that are caused by acoustic pressure changes. Therefore, there must be another means for this signal transfer. A bone conduction audiogram \u2013 apart from a reduced transfer of especially the higher frequencies \u2013 is not fundamentally different from a pure airborne tone threshold audiogram. It follows that the perilymph movement within the cochlea must somehow also generate the bone conducted signal transfer. And indeed there is such a possibility. The scala tympani is directly connected with the cerebrospinal cavity by means of the cochlear aqueduct, which has its opening in the vicinity of the round window. The cochlear aqueduct enables the perilymph to move backwards and forwards between the cranial cavity and the cochlear channels (scala tympani and scala vestibuli). The perilymph in this cranial cavity is exposed to the alternating pressures caused by the sound induced vibrations of the shell shaped cranial bones that are located in the front and the back of the skull. As a consequence of Newton\u2019s fundamental law of motion we know that when a larger amount of fluid inside the skull must be brought into motion, the effect of these stimuli will be smaller for the higher frequency contributions than for those of the airborne stimuli for similar frequencies. Furthermore, the stapes introduces the airborne signal that results in a backwards and forwards motion of perilymph, in opposite phase to the back and forth motion of perilymph along the \nbasilar membrane, which is evoked by bone conduction. This results in a slight reduction of the airborne signal, which actually is the stronger of the two stimuli. <\/p>\n\n<p>pp: 19-21: The alternating movement of perilymph between the cerebrospinal cavity and the scala tympani via the cochlear aqueduct will also be partially directed towards the round window. This splitting up into two directions of the perilymph movement creates a reduced perilymph velocity in front of the basilar membrane, and finally results in a reduction of the bone conduction signal. The rate of reduction depends on the mobility ratio between the oval window and the round window. A further decrease in round window mobility, related to the mobility of the oval window, results in a higher perilymph \nmovement in front of the basilar membrane, which evokes a higher bone conduction signal, while an increase would result in a lower one.<\/p>\n\n<p>pp: 19-21: This hypothesis that bone conduction consists entirely of the push-pull movement of perilymph from the cerebrospinal cavity via the cochlear aqueduct, and is evoked by the vibration of the shell shaped bones of the skull, while the rigid temporal bone does not deform at all, is just one logical step further than the functional possibilities indicated by others.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5627,"question_id":3851,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1357116220}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3851/bone-conduction-different-from-the-normal-hearing-phenomena-in-humans","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/physics/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"active researchers, academics and students of physics","favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/physics/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/physics/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"physics","open_beta_date":1289260800,"site_state":"normal","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.physics","name":"Physics Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=physics.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1288656000,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#EBF5F5","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#5A8788"},"markdown_extensions":["MathJax"],"site_url":"http://physics.stackexchange.com","name":"Physics","high_resolution_icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/physics/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png","twitter_account":"StackPhysics","launch_date":1298505600},"on_date":1349716502,"question_id":39265},"last_activity_date":1357116220,"creation_date":1349605205,"answer_count":2,"title":"Bone conduction .

Middle and late genes tend to help the virus co-opt cellular machinery to aid in viral replication. Late genes are then useful for final stages of viral assembly and ultimtely their exit from the cell (lysis) and the newly made viral particles can go on and infect more cells. When viewed in this manner, it follows that removing even one coding region from the viral genome would inhibit the overall infection/reproduction/assembly process.

As a result, each human can trace back their mitochondrial lineage as an unbroken chain to a single individual woman in the past.  Through random chance (genetic drift) or natural selection women in some mitochondrial lines will pass offspring to the next generation, while others will not.  If a woman fails to pass offspring to the next generation then she represents the end (i.e., extinction) of a particular mitochondrial lineage.  As time progresses more and more of the original mitochondrial lineages will go extinct until all humans represent one remaining linage. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this is a continual process since lineages accumulate differences through mutation of the mitochondrial DNA.  This mutation is the source of the different lineages that that will go forward.  Based on the estimated rate of mitochondrial DNA mutation we can estimate how long  it would take for extant mitochondria to have developed the genetic differences we now see. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you take a snapshot of this process at one point in time (e.g., contemporary humans), you can use this estimated time to say how long it would take to accumulate the present differences - that is when the line began.

So in a large population with more initial diversity each line will have a lower probability of succeeding.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, if there is no selection for or against a given line then changes in frequency are due to chance (genetic drift). In a large population the effect of drift is smaller than it is on a small population.  So if the population size is small, then the likelihood that a mitochondrial line will go extinct is greater and the rate of a single mitochondrial line succeeding to be the mitochondrial eve is greater.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5494,"question_id":5488,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1355499328},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5e8817011bf40f20c518af3c0dc7187?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":137,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/137/kennypeanuts","reputation":1522,"display_name":"KennyPeanuts","accept_rate":75},"score":0,"post_id":5495,"edited":false,"creation_date":1355424758,"comment_id":7902,"body":"Based on the comment to my answer I removed the mention of isolation so I edited out your reference to the part of my answer that no longer exists."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":5495,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5e8817011bf40f20c518af3c0dc7187?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":137,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/137/kennypeanuts","reputation":1522,"display_name":"KennyPeanuts","accept_rate":75},"edited":false,"creation_date":1355425249,"comment_id":7903,"body":"I was also editing - i think i ran over your changes, but i took the reference to you out."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/716b5b6ad050ab528046c96e324bd0cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1774,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1774/molf","reputation":143,"display_name":"molf"},"score":1,"post_id":5495,"edited":false,"creation_date":1355488786,"comment_id":7912,"body":"This notion seems to conflict with the hypothesis that our current M-Eve was not the only woman alive at the time.

If the behavior is plastic (i.e., it can be changed by a single human) and the current situation provides the appropriate information about the state of the behavior, then the behavior will change.

All ELISA techniques make use of the fact that proteins stick to plastic. In your case the protein components of the saliva, including the virus (the viral coat is proteinaceous) will stick to the wells. After rinsing out the sample the wells are treated with another protein (usually bovine serum albumin (BSA)) to completely block all available protein binding sites. At this stage these wells will no longer bind protein non-specifically, but will bind anti-EBV Ig because of the presence of the EBV particles bound to the plastic. This bound anti-EBV can then be detected with a secondary antibody. The protein complexes will build as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>plastic/EBV/rabbit anti-EBV/goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate<\/p>\n\n<p>It would also be possible to do this experiment as a sandwich ELISA. In this format the wells would have been pretreated with anti-EBV serum (or purified anti-EBV IgG) then blocked with BSA. At this stage these wells will no longer bind protein non-specifically, but will bind EBV because of the presence of the EBV-specific antibody. Once samples have been incubated in these wells (so that any EBV can bind to the antibody coating the wells) another antibody (raised in a different animal) is added, and this will bind to the EBV that has been captured by the original antibody that coats the wells. This latter antibody is then detected with a conjugate. The protein complexes will build as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>plastic/mouse anti-EBV/EBV/rabbit anti-EBV/goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate<\/p>\n\n<p>Your description of how to get the antibodies is basically correct, except that the primary antibody will probably have been raised in rabbits or mice, and certainly not in humans.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Added later:<\/strong> I didn't read the first question carefully enough. An ELISA is an <em>assay<\/em> because it measures something. It is based on a binding reaction mediated by an antibody-antigen interaction (<em>immunosorbent<\/em>). It is <em>enzyme-linked<\/em> because the secondary antibody is present as an antibody-enzyme conjugate.

One of these tubes contained the Epstein-Barr virus, which on its turn causes Pfeiffer's disease, aka the 'kissing disease' (so we basically conducted an experiment to see how fast the virus would spread within a class if everybody started kissing each other, if you don't mind the crudity).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Everybody mixed their saliva with the saliva of 3 other people, so at the end everybody had a tube with the saliva of 4 different people in it.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Since we worked in pairs of 2, every duo got a microtiter plate with 12 wells in it: 3 wells for a positive control, 3 wells for a negative control, 3 wells for the fluids of 1 of the duo and 3 wells for the fluids of the other one. You pippete in (is that correct?) the fluids accordingly. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>After a while you rinse and clean the wells with wash buffer.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Then you pippete in the primary antibody in each well.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>After a while you rinse and clean the wells with wash buffer.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Following this you pippete in the secondary antibody (conjugated with the enzyme HRP).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>After a while you rinse and clean the wells with wash buffer.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Finally, you add the enzyme substrate (TMB) to each well. This causes a blue color if when in contact with HRP. The positive controls must come out blue, the negative must come out colorless, and the other wells can go either way, depending if you have the virus.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I hope this is not to crudely explained, again. These are my questions concerning the experiment:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What do the components of the acronym 'ELISA' actually stand for? Does immunosorbent refer to the binding of the antigens to the wells? My English isn't too good, and these acronyms and abbreviations often seem foreign to me (nevermind that they are foreign since I'm not English, you get the point I hope). <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>When you pippete in the saliva in the wells, what actually sticks to the wells? All of the antigens in your saliva? Because it's hard to believe that they make special microtiter plates for every single antigen seperately. I assume it is only the antigens, since the primary antibodies attach to the antigens only, so there is no need for the microtiter plate itself to bind to antibodies. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>How would we get the primary and secondary antibody? This is my assumption: The primary antibody we get is by injecting some antigens of the Epstein-Barr Virus into a human and then taking a serum. The secondary antibody could be gotten by injecting a random human primary antibody into ANY animal, irrelevant which anyimal, and then taking a serum. After that you conjugate an enzyme to the secondary antibody.

The \"complicated\" solutions, as you say, include a bunch of ingredients. The detergent is largely present to dissolve cell membranes (which are lipid-based) and allow for extraction of proteins or other biochemicals from within the cell (and organelles in eukaryotes). There are also two types of detergents: ionic and anionic. Both detergent types will dissolve membranes, but ionic detergents tend to be harsher of the two by strongly disrupting protein structures.<\/p>\n\n<p>If protein biochemistry is important, then the next most important ingredients will be specific inhibitors of proteases: enzymes which degrade proteins. There are many of these, but some examples include PMSF, EDTA, aprotinin, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is necessary to buffer the pH of lysis solution to monitor protein complexes, or keep a protein natured, or keep DNA in an optimal pH range. General solutions for lysis buffers include Tris-EDTA (TE), PBS, etc. This choice comes down to whether you want a buffer, and in which pH range you wish to keep your lysis solution. Common buffers like TE and PBS are made up for a pH range of between 7-8. There are other buffers that are used for low pH ranges (pH 4-6), but are usually less common.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, there are ways to lyse cells without using any kind of lysis buffer. One method is to use sonication, which uses directed pulses of high-frequency sound to lyse cells by mechanically shearing them. Another method is to repeatedly freeze-thaw cells from -80&deg;C to 4&deg;C (usually 3 times is sufficient). Lysis in this manner is accomplished by repeated formation of ice crystals which cut open cells, releasing their contents.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have a more specific question, one of us can guide you further, but this provides a general overview of what is involved with cell lysis buffers.<\/p>\n","answer_id":5481,"question_id":5480,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmtoK.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1320,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1320/alan-boyd","reputation":17240,"display_name":"Alan Boyd"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1355326541,"creation_date":1355326541,"body":"<p>I wonder how you plan to measure lysis?

For the experiments reported here, steady-state unicellular C. vulgaris continuous cultures were inoculated with the predator Ochromonas vallescia, a phagotrophic flagellated protist (`flagellate'). Within less than 100 generations of the prey, a multicellular Chlorella growth form became dominant in the culture (subsequently repeated in other cultures). The prey Chlorella first formed globose clusters of tens to hundreds of cells. After about 10-20 generations in the presence of the phagotroph, eight-celled colonies predominated. These colonies retained the eight-celled form indefinitely in continuous culture and when plated onto agar. These self-replicating, stable colonies were virtually immune to predation by the flagellate, but small enough that each Chlorella cell was exposed directly to the nutrient medium.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":5479,"question_id":5477,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1355310655}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5477/are-there-oligocellular-organisms-in-nature-and-if-so-what-are-they-like","last_activity_date":1355315026,"creation_date":1355277583,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there oligocellular organisms in nature and, if so, what are they like?","body":"<p>I'd think protozoans can be oligocellular, but I haven't found any examples, and I'm curious to know what is the minimum number of cells an organism can have other than a single cell.<\/p>\n","question_id":5477,"tags":["cell-biology"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":363,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1355315026},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11fb9af19c1542d27d89e5127a534914?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/496/halime","reputation":203,"display_name":"Halime"},"answers":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user560"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11fb9af19c1542d27d89e5127a534914?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/496/halime","reputation":203,"display_name":"Halime"},"score":0,"post_id":1432,"edited":false,"creation_date":1331836316,"comment_id":1775,"body":"But if a blot clot gets stuck in a small capillary, won&#39;t it get occluded and prevent blood flow?

Every genome has a large repertoire of machines that it can construct. For a given organism, all its somatic cells will have the same DNA (more or less, but let's put that aside) since it starts out as a single cell. In spite of this, you can see that cells can have completely different shapes and functions. For example, look at how different a neuron is from a muscle cell or a blood cell in terms of shape and function. In addition, cells can change in reaction to their environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then how is the repertoire the same but the cells completely different?<\/p>\n\n<p>The solution is <strong>choosing which genes to activate<\/strong>. This is the called gene regulation and is an extremely complex system as you might guess. It is to some extent the \"brain\" of the cell, with which the cells can make decisions and gain its plasticity in biological function. This system operates on many levels, one of them being by controlling transcription, i.e. transcriptional regulation, which controls how much RNA to make from each gene, which will later translate into some level of activation (no RNA means the gene will not be active). This is why the RNA will probably vary widely according to the cell type and cellular state.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, each species have a similar DNA sequence give or take some minor variations. The sequence of family members will be even more similar, and the sequence of clones (e.g. identical twins) will be virtually identical.

This means that an inflammatory response is not elicited in case of the introduction of an antigen.<\/p>\n\n<p>I quote from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27174/#A1973\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immunobiology by Charles Janeway<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some body sites are immunologically privileged. Tissue grafts placed in these sites often last indefinitely, and antigens placed in these sites do not elicit destructive immune responses.\n  Paradoxically, the antigens sequestered in immunologically privileged sites are often the targets of autoimmune attack; for example, brain autoantigens such as myelin basic protein are targeted in multiple sclerosis. It is therefore clear that this antigen does not induce tolerance due to clonal deletion of the self-reactive T cells. Mice only become diseased when they are deliberately immunized with myelin basic protein, in which case they become acutely sick, show severe infiltration of the brain with specific TH1 cells, and often die.<br>\n  Thus, at least some antigens expressed in immunologically privileged sites induce neither tolerance nor activation, but if activation is induced elsewhere they can become targets for autoimmune attack (see Section 13-25). It seems plausible that T cells specific for antigens sequestered in immunologically privileged sites are more likely to remain in a state of immunological ignorance. Further evidence for this comes from the eye disease sympathetic ophthalmia (Fig. 13.36). If one eye is ruptured by a blow or other trauma, an autoimmune response to eye proteins can occur, although this happens only rarely. Once the response is induced, it often attacks both eyes. Immuno-suppression and removal of the damaged eye, the source of antigen, is frequently required to preserve vision in the undamaged eye. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27174/bin/CH13F36.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 13.36\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":5437,"question_id":5436,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1355028989}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5436/eyelids-interconnected","last_activity_date":1355028989,"creation_date":1354901806,"answer_count":1,"title":"Eyelids interconnected?","body":"<p>I've seen a patient who had a Vitrectomy (eye surgery) done on a single eye manifest massive swelling on both eyelids.<\/p>\n\n<p>That seems like having my left hand swell after punching a wall with my right one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this example in the eyes rare?

The first measurement is the <em>gross energy<\/em> (GE) which is measured through bomb calorimetry and is basically how much heat a substance gives off when completely burnt. I have recently read in a compendium that the GE value of fat is ~9,4 kcal/g.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The next stage is <em>digestible energy<\/em> (DE), which is how much of the forage you actually can digest, which would exclude for example fibres. <\/p>\n\n<p>Next stage is the <em>metabolizable energy<\/em> (ME), the energy which can be used in actual metabolism (DE - energy losses from transporting nutrients etc). This are the value you reported. (I don't have a source, but I've heard the same values from multiple recognized sources.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Now is the part where it gets a bit trickier, as the final measurement of energy is the <em>net energy<\/em> (NE). This is defined as the metabolic energy minus the heat increment, which could be simplified as the energy losses through the conversion between different types of energy (ie. from long carbohydrates into glucose etc.) within the body. Even more simplified it can be said to be the difference between the heat production in a fastened person and the heat production in a fed person, thus being the heat produced by eating, digesting, absorbing and transporting food.<\/p>\n\n<p>I argue that because the fat already is incorporated in the body it has a very efficient value, and very little transportation within the body is needed. And because the energy (ie, the fat) is internal, it is not accounted for in the heat increment and therefore the NE of internal fat is the same as ME. <\/p>\n\n<p>And according to the wikipedia-article you linked to United Nations recommendation of the average minimum energy consumption per person is 1800 kcal/day. <strong>Thus the amount of fat required to meet the minimum <em>energy requirements<\/em> of a person would be 1800/9=200g of fat per day.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more about the different energy-measurements and the heat increment here is a good <a href=\"http://www.extension.org/pages/22405/energetics-for-the-practicing-nutritionist#ME_versus_NE_Systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">link.<\/a> And don't forget that energy alone is not sufficient for a person as we need protein, vitamins, minerals etc...<\/p>\n","answer_id":5447,"question_id":5400,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5400/how-much-energy-does-human-body-fat-contain","last_activity_date":1355014238,"creation_date":1354401385,"answer_count":1,"title":"How much energy does human body fat contain?","body":"<p>I have been reading the Wikipedia article about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy\">food energy<\/a>, but as I'm not a biologist, I don't really understand it properly, so I came here to ask you guys.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is: <strong>If a human body needs X kcal of energy and it's taking it from the stored fat, how much fat (weight/kg) does it need to burn?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I know that 1 gram of fat represents 9 kcal of energy, but according to the food energy article, the efficiency of getting that energy isn't 100%, so the formula might be a lot more difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what is the real efficiency value here.

It is especially true for change in properties of cell membranes, where all cell receptors are located and which are place where neural signal run."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FW2a.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1281,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1281/edward-ruchevits","reputation":123,"display_name":"Edward Ruchevits"},"score":0,"post_id":5380,"edited":false,"creation_date":1354219453,"comment_id":7714,"body":"@permeakra Thank you for participation!

The body's natural response to a rise in blood glucose will be stimulated secretion of insulin (from B cells of the pancreatic islets). Alcohol is metabolized primarily by the liver, being first converted to acetaldehyde by alohol dehydrogenase and a coezyme NAD+. Acetaldehyde metabolism quickly converts this to acetate. Acetate is then eventually metabolized elsewhere in the body to carbon dioxide and water. The interesting effects are mediated by acetaldehyde, which can accumulate to toxic levels in some people. This ties into insulin because <a href=\"http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17916634\">this article<\/a> suggests that alcohol consumption changes blood flow from exocrine pancreas (responsible for digestive enzymes) to endocrine pancreas (responsible for secreting homrones, such as glucagon, insulin, somatostatin).
