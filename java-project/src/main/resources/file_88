If most of the phenotypic variance is genetically coded, you'd expect that the trait will change through if different variant of the trait influence fitness (which is a function of both survival and reproductive success). Stated differently and more accurately the change in mean value of a given trait $R$ in the population is given by:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$R=S\\frac{V_{Ga}}{V_{P}} = S\\frac{V_{Ga}}{V_{G}+V_{E}} =  S\\frac{V_{Ga}}{V_{Ga} + V_{Gd}+V_{E}} $$<\/p>\n\n<p>, where $S$ is the selection differential, $V_{G} = V_{Ga}+ V_{Gd}$ is the genetic variance where its two components are the additive and dominance genetic variance respectively. $V_P  = V_G + V_E$ is the phenotypic variance which two components are the genetic and environmental variances. The ratio $\\frac{V_{Ga}}{V_{P}}$ has a name; it is called the heritability in the narrow sense symbolized by $h_N$ Note: I present here a simplified version of the reality! <\/p>\n\n<p>So, if the trait you consider has genetic variance in the population and that this trait influence the fitness with a given selection differential you can provide estimates of how the trait will change through time in the human population. Now if the variance does not already exist in the population but you have to wait for mutations to occur, then you cannot really provide an estimate of when will this occur.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion on the future evolution of nail size<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Also, when you think about some traits such as our nails. You may consider that they are of no use but do you really think that those people that have no nail would really have a better fitness. At first I would tend to think that I would rather chose a partner that have nails, it is much more sexy! If many people are like me and appreciate nails, nailless people will have difficulties to reproduce or in other words, they will have a lower fitness that nailed people.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think we have data on what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">loci<\/a> (positions on the chromosomes) influence the size of the nails and about how much of the variance in nail size is explained by the genetic additive variance. And how do the size of our nails influence fitness. So we don't know about how this trait will evolve through time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Future evolution of other traits<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There are several traits that we can/could more or less predict their evolution. Those are the traits for which we know the ratio of the genetic additive variance over the phenotypic variance and how it influences fitness.

If malaria comes to a new area you might expect the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele\" rel=\"nofollow\">allele<\/a> (=variant of a gene) allowing a better resistance to malaria will increase in frequency (note that this allele is advantageous in heterozyotes (protects from malaria) but it is highly disadvantegous in homozygote because it causes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">sickle-cel disease<\/a>).

I was unable to find other isolation attempts, but my research was very brief.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for which genes to detect, studies involving human blood samples have found that PCR amplification of B1 paralogs provides a sensitive and selective method for detecting <em>T. gondii<\/em>. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC267672/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burg et al<\/a> found that there are about 35 copies of the B1 gene in <em>T. gondii<\/em> and also state that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because of its repetitive nature, the B1 gene is an attractive target for detecting T. gondii parasites through amplification of B1-specific DNA.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They were able to amplify and detect the gene from crude cell lysate as well as from purified DNA samples containing a 1:10 000 ratio of parasite to leukocyte. Furthermore, they could not detect the gene when assaying other organisms. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC495065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ho-Yen et al.<\/a> later attempted PCR amplification of the same genes in human blood from patients with suspected toxoplasmosis and found that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PCR can be reliably used on human blood samples. For a reference laboratory, this is a valuable addition to its array of diagnostic tests, and provides a more rapid assay than animal culture. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10711675\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jones et al.<\/a> compared detection of the B1 genes with P30 and 18S rRNA genes in aqueous humour. They were able to detect 50 fg of gDNA using the B1 assay, which is equivalent to a single parasite. They concluded that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The B1 PCR protocol appears to be the most sensitive protocol in the detection of T. gondii DNA and has been successful in identification of T. gondii DNA in ocular fluids and retinal sections.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":16940,"question_id":16924,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16924/saliva-test-for-toxoplasma-gondii","last_activity_date":1398618076,"creation_date":1398612640,"answer_count":1,"title":"Saliva test for Toxoplasma gondii?","body":"<p>I am trying to find some reliable gene kit by which you can rapidly test Toxoplasma gondii.\nI am not sure if it exists.\nI have an intuition that some tests done during 90s-00s on this species had high false negatives.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Which genes should you detect to find Toxoplasma gondii in a gene kit?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":16924,"tags":["parasitology","saliva"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":16940,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":123,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":0,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1398617368,"creation_date":1398617368,"body":"<p>The absorption is itself not different, but the rate of absorbed substances is different because of greater amounts of proteins in the allergic lymphatic circulation. \nSo less capacity stays for circulation of nutrients and so less absorption in time.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16936,"question_id":16005,"up_vote_count":0,"community_owned_date":1398617368}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16005/is-nutrient-absorption-different-in-hypersensitive-i-patients","last_activity_date":1398617368,"creation_date":1395507346,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is nutrient absorption different in Hypersensitive I patients?","body":"<p>I am thinking how the nutrient absorption differs between between patients with allergies (Hypersensitivity I) and those not. <\/p>\n\n<p>The current guideline about number of eggs in diet is one daily regularly.\nMy professor says that 1-4 eggs daily can be also ok because cholesterol is inhibited.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I am thinking if we have Hypersensitive (allergic) person, what the recommendation should be then.\nMy hypothesis says that more cholesterol would be absorbed and less inhibited.\nHowever, I cannot find any evidence for this hypothesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hypersensitive response is fast. \nI am interested in many responses during long term.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does nutrient absorption differ in hypersensitive patient and normal patient?<\/strong><\/p>\n","question_id":16005,"tags":["diet","allergies","eggs","hypersensitivity"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":16936,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":-1,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"score":0,"post_id":16934,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433060146,"comment_id":56007,"body":"Downvoter!

Now for reasons of symmetry I think you can show that the relative frequencies of $p$ and $q$ are equal and so $p' = p.$ Then you have to show that this equilibrium solution is unique.) <\/p>\n\n<p>For a single locus the derivations of `heterozygote advantage' I have found,<a href=\"http://w3.ualg.pt/~rcastil/GPE/Main_files/0_Tamarin_Processes_change_book_chapter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1)<\/a><a href=\"http://evol.bio.lmu.de/_teaching/evogen/Evo7-Summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2)<\/a>, assign fitness weights as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>AA = (1 - s),     Aa = 1,       aa = (1 - t )<\/p>\n\n<p>in which $s,t &gt; 0, s \\neq t$ in general, from which they derive as a condition for equilibrium <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\Delta q = \\frac{pq(sp-tq)}{\\bar{W}}  = 0$$<\/p>\n\n<p>so <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{t}{s+t} ~~~\\text{and}~~~ \\hat{q} = \\frac{s }{s+t}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>in which $\\hat{p}, \\hat{q}$ are equilibrum frequencies for each allele, respectively, and s and t are rates of mutation. Nowhere did I see a model in which they had assigned the same fitness to both homozygous cases (AA, aa) but it's just a special case of the heterozygote advantage model. <\/p>\n\n<p>fitness (AA) = fitness(aa) = (1 - s/2), fitness(Aa) = (1+ s/2). <\/p>\n\n<p>So if we subtract s/2 from each fitness score (or normalize with respect to Aa to the same effect), we get: <\/p>\n\n<p>fitness(AA) = fitness (aa) = (1- s ) and fitness (Aa) = 1 as in the two references above, except that now the two homozygous states have equal fitness. <\/p>\n\n<p>But then we have $$\\Delta q = \\frac{pq(sp-sq)}{\\bar{W}} =  \\frac{pqs(p - q)}{\\bar{W}} $$<\/p>\n\n<p>and the only nontrivial solution is $p = q = 1/2.$ <\/p>\n\n<p>So what I am suggesting is that when you assign the same fitness to both $AA$ and $aa$ you no longer have the general case. As for the value of s being forced, the following seems relevant.<\/p>\n\n<p>The full expression from (2) for the equilibrium condition is <\/p>\n\n<p>$$p' = \\frac{p^2 W_{AA}+ pq W_{Aa}}{\\bar{W}} \\hspace{10mm}(1)$$<\/p>\n\n<p>in which$ W_{AA} = W_{aa} =  1- s$ and $W_{Aa} = 1$ and <\/p>\n\n<p>$\\bar{W} = p^2 W_{AA}+2pqW_{Aa}+q^2W_{aa}$<\/p>\n\n<p>If the homozygotes are assigned the same fitness and $p = q = 1/2$ , equation (1) above becomes:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$p' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}(1-s)}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(1-s)} $$<\/p>\n\n<p>The program on page 583 of (1) is helpful. Let h:= heterozygous and m:= homozygous. If $p = q = 1/2$ then as long as fitness(h) and fitness(m) are equal the system is in equilibrium immediately. <\/p>\n\n<p>If $p\\neq 1/2$ then as long as f(h) = f(m) the system reaches equilibrium at $p = 1/2$ asymtotically.

Rather, seeds may fail to develop due to either lack of fertilization (pollination) or a natural tendency. The natural production of unfertilized and thus seedless fruit is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parthenocarpy<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To quote the Scientific American article (<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-seedless-fruits-ar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>) mentioned by Oreotrephes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fruit development normally begins when one or more egg cells in the\n  ovular compartment of the flower are fertilized by sperm nuclei from\n  pollen. In some plants, however, fruit develops without fertilization,\n  a phenomenon known as parthenocarpy. Parthenocarpic fruit has\n  advantages over seeded fruit: longer shelf life and greater consumer\n  appeal.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The most frequent reasons for lack of seed development are pollination\n  failure, or nonfunctional eggs or sperm. In many plants,\n  self-incompatibility genes limit successful fertilization to\n  cross-pollination between genetically different male and female\n  parents. This property is exploited by citrus farmers who grow\n  seedless fruits, such as navel oranges and clementines. Because these\n  cultivars are self-incompatible, they fail to set seed when they are\n  planted in orchards of identical plants (clones). These plants have a\n  high frequency of parthenocarpy, however, so they still produce fruit.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Parthenocarpic varieties may arise from a lack of pollinators.

Some\n  parthenocarpic varieties have been developed as genetically modified\n  organisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To preserve the seedless trait, parthenocarpic trees can be propagated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting\" rel=\"nofollow\">grafting<\/a>.

See my diagram below The bilayer is composed of phospholipids, classic amphiphiles with a polar head group and a nonpolar tail group. The polar head group can interact favourably (in a thermodynamic sense) with the cytosol through hydrogen bonds. In contrast the hydrocarbon tails cannot interact with water through hydrogen bonds.

Firstly some background: The rumen and reticulum form the first two parts of the four, and are in fact a single chamber/organ (collectively known as the reticulorumen). They have different wall structures, and perform initial digestion of different particles (mostly heavier particles in the rumen such as grain and more digested hay). This reticulorumen chamber is where the initial microbial fermentation of the feed occurs. Matter passes from rumen to reticulum and back regularly by means of two distinct muscle contractions.<\/p>\n\n<p>To aid in the breakdown of the feed, the cud is regularly regurgitated, chewed and then re-ingested. The re-ingested cud returns to the reticulorumen. From there, in order to advance down into the later stages of the digestive tract, it must pass through the reticulorumen orifice into the third compartment - the omasum. The orifice allows particles up to 4mm in size in cattle.<\/p>\n\n<p>The omasum chamber removes water and some nutrients. The contractions of the omasum remove water and move solids through the system, and the contractions are speculated to filter out any larger particles and return them to the reticulorumen. Matter that has been processed by the omasum is passed along to the fourth chamber, the abomasum. <\/p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question in brief, after mastication the cud returns to chambers one and two, potentially going round this loop several times until it is sufficiently broken down by chewing, saliva and bacterial action, and then it can proceed from there to the third chamber.<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"digesta circulation and reticulo rumen motility in the ruminent\" paper (C. Poncet, C.H. Malbert, R. Baumont) has this to say:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The outflow of digesta, allowed by the opening of the ROO [reticulorumen orifice] during the second phase of the reticular contraction, is highly selective. The effluent does not contain particles greater than 2mm in sheep and 4mm in cattle. This is due to the buoyancy of the large particles in the reticulum, to the self filtration of the digesta during the passage through the ROO and perhaps to backflows from the omasum to the reticulum.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You may find it useful to get a copy of this collection of papers (quote from p.366): <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bcsa8Z4u-E4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bcsa8Z4u-E4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false<\/a> <\/p>\n","answer_id":16676,"question_id":16672,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1398020528}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16672/how-does-regurgitated-food-go-to-the-3rd-stomach-chamber-instead-of-going-to-the","last_activity_date":1398020528,"creation_date":1397894813,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does regurgitated food go to the 3rd stomach chamber instead of going to the 1st?","body":"<p>Ruminants are known for their regurgitation of food; the food goes through the 1st and 2nd stomach chambers, then returns to the oral cavity in cuds.

Several hypotheses have been suggested as explanations, including bending energy (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519370800327\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>) and effects on oxygen transport (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002555649390062F\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>).

The biconcave\n  profile of the discocyte means that much of the mass is distributed in\n  the periphery. This increases the moment of inertia of the cell and\n  subsequently renders the erythrocyte less prone to rotation during\n  flow in the large vessels. Here it is suggest that this reduction in\n  rotation promotes laminar flow and discourages platelet scattering by\n  minimising the \"Eddy currents\" and it thus anti-atherogenic. A number\n  of pathological mutations result in the red blood cell adopting a\n  spherical shape as opposed to the biconcave disc profile. The sphere\n  has a smaller moment of inertia when compared to the discocyte, as\n  much of the mass is distributed round the centre. The spherocyte is\n  hence much more prone to rotation during flow in the large vessels.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The advantages of various structures do depend on the scale of the system, as you say. For red blood cells, the size of capillaries and veins are of importance. The shape of red blood cells differ in animals that have blood transport systems with different structures than humans. Thus, the red blood cell shape is likely optimized with respect to movement in the human blood transport system, with oxygen diffusion also being a possible factor.

For example, our immune system picks every 7 days (reason why the 7th day after a transplant is the most likely one may reject the organ). This 7-day cycle is also observed in other life forms... \nBut, read for yourself:\n a seven-day cycle has been found in fluctuations of blood pressure, acid content in blood, red blood cells, heartbeat, oral temperature, female breast temperature, urine chemistry and volume, the ratio between two important neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and the rise and fall of several body chemicals such as the stress coping hormone, cortisol. \"In fact,\" Perry and Dawson note, \"weekly rhythms appear easiest to detect when the body is under stress, such as when it is defending itself against a virus, bacterium, or other harmful intruder. For example, cold symptoms (which are really signs of the body defending itself against the cold virus) last about a week.

Campbell explains: \"When a human patient receives a kidney transplant, there is a rhythm of about seven days, a predictable rise and fall in the probability that the body's immune system will reject the new kidney. A major peak of rejection occurs seven days after the operation, and when a serum is given to suppress the immune reaction, a series of peaks occurs, with increasing risk of rejection, at one week, two weeks, three weeks and at four weeks, the time of the highest of all.\" [Jeremy Campbell, Winston Churchill's Afternoon Nap, (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986). p. 76]<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in answer to your question... it makes a lot of sense that if so many of our body functions have 7-day rythms, we would feel a biological need to slow down and allow our bodies to rest, rejuvenate.... <\/p>\n","answer_id":16666,"question_id":5171,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5171/is-there-any-biological-reason-for-humans-to-rest-after-x-days-of-work","last_activity_date":1397857514,"creation_date":1352394362,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is there any biological reason for humans to rest after x days of work?","body":"<p>A lot of people live in a 7 day cycle, where 5 days of work are followed by 2 days of \"rest\".

Given the necessary function of rpoA, I would be willing to bet that SigA is the factor responsible for its transcription, so I will focus my discussion there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Predicting promoters without experimentation can be very challenging given their immense variability. The <em>idealized<\/em> core promoter consists of a -10 region, a spacer and a -35 region. Recognition of the promoter by a sigma factor is done at the -10 and -35 regions: each sigma factor recognizes a different consensus sequence. <em>Bacillus subtilis<\/em> SigA recognizes the consensus sequences TTGACA (-35) and TATAAT (-10). They key word there is consensus however, as it is rare that a promoter will actually contain these exact sequences. In reality, 3/6 nucleotides matching could be considered reasonable. Between the -10 and -35 regions is a spacer with conserved length. In the absence of transcription activators, SigA requires a 17 +/- 1 nucleotide spacer. This is due to thermodynamic constraints. Very briefly, promoter melting (at -10) is dependent the angle between the -10 and -35 regions. Given the helical nature of DNA, this angle is in turn dependent on the distance between the -10 and -35 regions. If the angle is just right, the untwisting of the DNA to align the promoter elements and thus allow sigma binding provides the energy to melt the promoter. If the angle is too large, the regions can never align. If the angle is to small, alignment will not provide enough energy for melting. Complicating this are non-standard core promoters and various flanking sequences that all play a role in transcription initiation. As a direct answer to one of your question, a single sigma factor can bind to many different DNA sequences with some conserved regions.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/255767013?report=graph&amp;tracks=%5Bkey%3agene_model_track,name%3aGenes---Unnamed,display_name%3aGenes,id%3aSTD3,category%3aGenes,annots%3aUnnamed,Options%3aMergePairs,SNPs%3afalse,CDSProductFeats%3atrue,ShowLabelsForAllFeatures%3atrue,HighlightMode:2%5D&amp;appname=ncbientreznuccore&amp;color=0&amp;label=0&amp;decor=0&amp;spacing=0&amp;v=148789.25:150016.75&amp;c=FFFF00&amp;gflip=false&amp;select=gi%7C255767013-000245c2-00024972-0101-6f461356-ffea8d58\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortunately, the <em>B. subtilis<\/em> genome has been sequenced.<\/a> Your search for the promoter might involve looking for the -10 and -35 regions 5' to the rpoA gene. This however doesn't take into account that rpoA might be part of a polycistronic operon and thus under the control of a promoter further upstream. <a href=\"http://jb.asm.org/content/168/1/65.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suh et al. (1986)<\/a> did basically this and reported:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our DNA sequence analysis suggests further experiments to study regulation within the rpoA region. Because inhibition of polycistronic message translation by free protein S4 is one of the chief controls of alpha operon expression in E. coli (16, 23), the apparent absence of S4 from the B. subtilis alpha region suggests different regulation. Although the close coupling of the rpsM and rpsK genes in our sequence (Fig. 3) supports the notion of a translational coupling similar to E. coli, the putative rpoA promoters in the relatively large intercistronic distance following rpsK are also different (28, 29). However, the apparent absence of a rho-independent terminator in this region could indicate that significant transcription occurs from additional upstream promoters in B. subtilis as well as in E. coli (28).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Albeit this is an old paper, but I was unable to find more recent studies in my quick research. Basically they compared the <em>B. subtilis<\/em> rpoA gene to that of <em>Escherichia coli<\/em>, where it is located in an operon with ribosomal proteins rpsM, rpsK, rpsD and rplQ (under the control of a single promoter). They found both similarities and differences. They were able to find two possible SigA core promoters in the region between rpoA and rpsK (the next gene 5' to rpoA in <em>B subtilis<\/em>). There was also a relatively large distance between the two genes, suggesting that they are not part of the same operon. Furthermore, they were able to find a ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) between the hypothetical promoters and the translation start site. On the other hand there is no transcription terminator between rpsK and rpoA which suggested that a promoter further upstream regulated rpoA expression. After their sequence analysis, they suggested that further experimentation was required.<\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it's hard to find promoters just by looking at the sequence. Even if you do find a possible promoter, it's impossible to say whether or not it is utilized without experimentation. That said, given that the alpha subunit is necessary for cell function, that the rpoA gene appears to be transcriptionally tied to ribosomal proteins (which are also necessary for cell function) and that SigA is the predominant factor in log phase <em>B. subtilis<\/em>, I feel that it is very likely that SigA is ultimately the factor responsible for rpoA expression<\/p>\n\n<p>I also thought I'd mention that there are various online bioinformatics tools that attempt to predict promoters, but I will not comment more on them because I have not used them.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16649,"question_id":15378,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15378/how-can-promoter-binding-sites-be-determined","last_activity_date":1397802991,"creation_date":1393446072,"answer_count":1,"title":"How can promoter binding sites be determined?","body":"<p>I have been trying to find out which sigma factor is responsible for the transcription of RNA polymerase subunits $\\alpha$ (rpoA) and $\\beta ^{\\prime}$ (rpoC) in <em>Bacillus subtilis<\/em>.
