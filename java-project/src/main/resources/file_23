Basically you are doing a self-cross. <\/p>\n\n<p>Many of these species can also be allogamous. In the case of the nematode you usually have the Hermaphrodite, which is XX and the male which is XO. The male only produces spermatozoa and when mating with the hermaphrodite, their sperm takes precedence over that of the hermaphrodite. This is likely due to a last in first out situation in the spermatheca of the hermaphrodite. Sperm develops in the hermaphrodite first and are deposited in the spermatheca, then the ova form. If a male mates with the hermaphrodite, 'his' sperm is deposited in the spermatheca of the hermaphrodite and then as the ova pass the spermatheca on their way to the vulva they are fertilized by the sperm.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=RxowAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT262&amp;lpg=PT262&amp;dq=allogametes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b3RLpLvmQh&amp;sig=sYQ49lXTgs8hSsjdGM9YaE-niaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9oMrVo_rJAhWI5SYKHQO9AewQ6AEIMzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=allogametes&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Urologic and Cutaneous Review: Technical supplement, Volume 2<\/a> from 1914 on a section on the origin of sexual reproduction (The Origin of Amphigony), also makes mention of the term \"allogametes\" in reference to protist cells which are able to differentiate and fuse and then divide asexually after the fusion even.

After 18 hr at 37 C the evolved CO was measured by gas chromatography.

In both cases the H20 2-producing organisms generated alpha hemolysis and formed CO from heme compounds, whereas the peroxide-negative bacteria did not demonstrate alpha hemolysis or CO formation. If, in alpha hemolysis, hemoglobin is converted into a green pigment without lysis of the red cell membrane, then the failure of this pigment to diffuse away from the colony would be explained.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Color change in beta-hemolysis can be explained with diffusion of content from lysed erythrocyte. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All six strains of bacteria that formed hemolytic zones on blood agar plates also produced CO from erythrocytes, and conversely the four strains that were nonhemolytic did not make CO. Despite this concordance, it appears that the formation of beta-hemolytic zones around colonies grown on blood agar plates does not depend on hemoglobin catabolism. Thus, prominent beta-hemolytic zones were formed under anaerobic conditions that prevented CO formation. Also, hemolysis but not CO formation was produced by sterile filtrates of the extracellular products from beta-hemolytic bacteria.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Clear zones resembling beta hemolysis can\n  be produced by simply freeze-thawing a spot\n  on a blood agar plate and then waiting a day\n  for hemoglobin to diffuse away from the lysed\n  cells.

But the methods we have are not perfect. The first evolutionary trees were based on morphological descriptions etc. and clearly some of the classifications were going to be wrong. These days we use molecular methods, which are probably more accurate but could also be wrong some times. For example if we based our phylogeny on one SNP variant we could have some idea about the phylogeny between a few species, but if we based it on millions of SNPs we would have a much better idea - as technology &amp; models improve that is becoming more realistic. The key point here being there is a difference between the trees we can draw from evidence, and the real evolutionary tree.<\/p>\n\n<p>If, for example, D evolved from B but was more genetically similar to  C it could be due to convergent evolution (if the same mutations are selected for in C and D but neutrally or negatively in B). This is because, if there is a shared standing genetic variation at the point of speciation or the same mutations occur after speciation, and then C &amp; D are imposed under similar selection and B is not, the allele favored in that environment will spread in C &amp; D but not B (it may drift in B). <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine this with humans, where populations split off around the globe. Two populations spread from Africa (A) in to Southern Europe (SE) and Western Asia (WA). Population WA then derived two more populations - Central Asian (CA) and Eastern European (EE). If the Eastern European population developed a habit for drinking cow milk, and that information passed to the Southern Europeans, then selection would favor the ability to digest lactose in those two populations. If we then used the lactase persistence SNP (which had standing genetic variation at the time of divergence) to derive a phylogeny the populations SE and EE would appear related because the allele for lactase persistence is common, but in A WA &amp; CA it would be rare (neutrally evolved). In this case the phylogeny we construct would be different to the true phylogenetic tree.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically if there is genetic variation at the point of divergence, or convergent selection, or any gene flow occurs after divergence it makes assessing the phylogeny more difficult and prone to error. <\/p>\n","answer_id":13983,"question_id":13956,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13956/is-there-any-genetic-similarity-that-defy-evolution-theory","last_activity_date":1451154720,"creation_date":1386928831,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is there any genetic similarity that defy evolution theory?","body":"<p>For example,<\/p>\n\n<p>say species A is common ancestor of B, and C.

That may be true on a superficial level, but pinnipeds primarily use their modified limbs (hindlimbs in seals and forelimbs in sea lions) to move through the water; they aren\u2019t relying on propulsion from a large fluke or caudal fin providing most of the propulsion with the front fins/limbs providing lift and allowing for change in direction. <em>This diversity of strategies in living marine mammals suggests differing situations encountered by differing ancestors with their own suites of characteristics, but in the case of whales it seems that their ancestors were best fitted to move by undulating their spinal column and using their limbs to provide some extra propulsion/direction.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":9980,"question_id":1581,"up_vote_count":13,"last_edit_date":1415223779},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b747ff4e7cd70078c996e1936009658?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":9152,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9152/davis-mann","reputation":21,"display_name":"Davis Mann"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b3c5b025ca581db5a8fdd2564b5367c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6511,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6511/bez","reputation":2430,"display_name":"Bez"},"score":1,"post_id":21136,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410208129,"comment_id":33146,"body":"It would be great if you could add some references to your response!"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1410203759,"creation_date":1410203759,"body":"<p>I've thought about this many times but enjoyed theorizing on possibilities vs researching evolutionary theory.

Am I right about this?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a very, very common myth, but it is a myth. Because blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain is critical for survival, cerebral circulation is one of the most tightly regulated systems in the body. Blood is not shunted from the brain to the gut for digestion.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a normal physiological state, total blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant due in part to the prominent contribution of large arteries to vascular resistance. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Eating, sleeping, walking, etc. are all normal physiological states. If we had blood shunted away from our brains after eating, we'd literally collapse after every meal.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In normotensive adults, cerebral blood flow is maintained at ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute, provided CPP is in the range of ~60 to 160 mmHg.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As eating alone doesn't <em>normally<\/em> cause our blood pressure to rise or fall, cerebral perfusion is constant regardless of what is or isn't in our digestive systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blood flow to the gastrointestinal system (or GI tract) is also regulated, but the flow varies widely:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Estimates of blood flow (in ml /min × 100 g) to the quiescent gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats range from 15 to 100 for the stomach, 35\u2013120 for the small intestine, and 10\u201374 for the colon. Somewhat lower values for resting blood flow to the stomach, small intestine, and colon have been reported for man. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the basic answer is that, yes, blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract varies, but blood is not shunted <em>from the brain<\/em> in favor of the GI tract.<\/p>\n\n<p>So why <em>do we get sleepy after a meal?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Sleepiness after a meal is caused by the level of peptides in your brain called orexins (aka hypocretins).<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1998, two groups of researchers simultaneously discovered 2 small neuropeptide hormones that regulate, among other things, wakefulness and feeding behavior. <\/p>\n\n<p>One group discovered them while searching for molecules that could bind to \"orphan\" receptors, that is, a brain receptor with an unknown \"binding\" molecule (called a ligand). They found that the prohormone <em>prepro-orexin<\/em> was found in a very small area of the hypothalamus which had been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis; this suggested the possibility that the neuropeptides might be involved in the regulation of food intake. When administered into free-feeding rats' brains, one of these peptides (orexin A/hypocretin 1) stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent manner (with attention to light and dark periods, i.e. the circadian rhythm), with a lower dose increasing rat feeding about 2-fold, and the higher dose inducing a 3+-fold increase in feeding compared to rats injected with a solution without the peptide (the other stimulated feeding to a lesser degree). The effect persisted for 4 hours. Furthermore, fasting rats produced more than twice as much orexins as rats feeding freely. For this reason, the molecules were names \"orexins\", after the Greek word <em>orexis<\/em>, which means \"appetite\". They speculated that the orexin-secreting neurons might somehow be modulated by glucose.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time, another group of researchers using a completely different approach found that the same group of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated by a peptide hormone similar in composition to the gut hormone <em>secretin<\/em>. They identified the same prohormone and its two peptides, naming them <em>hypocretins<\/em> for \"hypothalamus\" and \"secretin\". They found that at least one of the peptides had a neuroexcitatory activity in specific areas of the brain (they mapped effects in the hypothalamic neurons, the posterior hypothalamus, the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the colliculi, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract) suggesting that the peptides acted within the central nervous system as homeostatic regulators with a role in nutritional homeostasis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scientists have not decided on whether to call them <em>orexins<\/em> or <em>hypocretins<\/em> yet, so both are used. They are found in all vertebrates.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/b3FeV.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sub>Mammalian orexin A sequences thus far identified (human, rat, mouse, pig, dog, sheep, and cow) are all identical, whereas the sequences of orexin B show some differences among species. From <em>Orexin/Hypocretin: A Neuropeptide at the Interface of Sleep, Energy Homeostasis, and Reward System<\/em>, Natsuko Tsujino and Takeshi Sakurai <\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p>In 1999, a group of scientists found that narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness) was caused by a lack of a hypocretin/orexin receptor 2 gene in certain dogs, therefore establishing that they play a very important part in the regulation of wakefulness.*<\/p>\n\n<p>Since then, an enormous body of work has shown that orexins/hypocretins (O/H from here on in) are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviors, including wakefulness and vigilance (needed to find food), systems that regulate emotion and reward (including drug-seeking behavior when stressed and eating for pleasure - \"consumption beyond homeostatic needs\" - leading to obesity), and more.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What does eating have to do with sleepiness?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Several studies report that the firing rates of O/H neurons are influenced by serum glucose, triglycerides and amino acids. <\/p>\n\n<p>In English: You are awake (O/H is being secreted by O/H neurons in your hypothalamus).

Recently, the topic has been revived and modern phylogenetic methods have been applied to large data sets, allowing researchers to assess, for the first time, the relative importance of three classic hypotheses for the function of coloration in mammals: concealment, communication, and regulation of physiological processes. Camouflage appears to be the single most important evolutionary force in explaining overall coloration in mammals, whereas patches of colored fur are used for intraspecific signaling. Sexual selection is associated with flamboyant ornamentation in a minority of primates and other restricted mammalian taxa, but to a far lesser extent than in birds. Interspecific signaling among mammals includes aposematic coloration, exaggeration of signals to deter pursuit, and lures for misdirecting predatory attack. Physiological causes of coloration, including melanism, are evident but poorly researched. The relative importance of evolutionary forces responsible for external coloration varies greatly between vertebrate taxa, but the reasons for this variation are not yet understood.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/125.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adaptive Significance of Coloration in Mammals<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":20966,"question_id":20965,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":9,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1409718298,"creation_date":1409718298,"body":"<p>Apparently the most noticeable research on this subject of a rabbit's white behind has been done by <a href=\"http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/265280.html\">Dr Dirk Semmann<\/a> of the University of Goettingen.

One of my favourite features of a Cochrane Review is the routine use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Funnel Plots<\/a>, where there are sufficient data to produce them. Sensible interpretation of funnel plots can give some fairly strong hints about the reproducibility of published literature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Funnel plots show datapoints of individual published studies which investigated the effectiveness of a technique when used for a specific purpose. The datapoints are plotted by estimated effect size (on the x axis) and an assessment of the quality of the trial, incorporating things like sample size and experimental design (on the y axis). A study with a small sample size and/or poor design (low on the y axis) would be expected to provide a relatively inaccurate estimate of the method's true effect size. As sample sizes increase and experimental methodology gets better (travelling up the y axis), you expect the studies to zero in on the true effect size, giving a pyramid or 'funnel' shape to the overall plot.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reproducibility of trials affects where the points are in the pyramid in a couple of ways. <\/p>\n\n<p>If there were a bunch of studies which looked for an effect of the method, and didn't find one, they might not be published because null results are considered boring by journal editors - the so-called 'file-drawer effect'. This would show up in a funnel plot as a pyramid that has a suspiciously low number of datapoints on the side of the pyramid that is close to the zero effect-size. The 'missing' datapoints are an indicator that this technique <em>probably<\/em> did not always reproduce an effect size as strong as the published effect sizes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other way that funnel plots can inform on the reproducibility of published studies is simply by looking at the width of the base of the pyramid. If it's wide, then with the experimental design methods of the studies at the bottom, the results aren't highly reproducible - different studies give very different results when looking at the same question.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's a big job to synthesise this into a global assessment of 'the reproducibility of pre-clinical trials', but if you're interested, I'd recommend you spend some time trawling the <a href=\"http://www.cochranelibrary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cochrane Library<\/a> to get a hang of the sorts of variance you're dealing with.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39034,"question_id":38984,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38984/how-good-is-the-reproducibility-of-preclinical-models","last_activity_date":1450888502,"creation_date":1442933817,"answer_count":1,"title":"How good is the reproducibility of preclinical models?","body":"<p>Unofficially, biology researchers always complain how frequently fail to replicate results others have achieved.

The characteristic\n  of Western agriculture is the use of artificial fertilizers. The\n  industries engaged in fixing atmospheric nitrogen for the production\n  of explosives during World War I, had to find other markets; the use\n  of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture increased, and today most\n  Western farmers based their fertilization programs in the cheapest\n  forms of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) available.\n  What we might call the NPK mentality dominates the farms as well as\n  research stations of agricultural research. Industrial vested\n  interests in times of national emergency settled firmly and could no\n  longer be dislodged.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(Sorry, it's been re-translated from a Portuguese translation.)<\/p>\n\n<p>He also added that the only way to preserve the soil's original (and healthier) fertility is to keep animals along with the plants, like Indians and Chinese did for millennia and still do (whose farmers he used to call \"my teachers\"). The animals complete the natural cycle of the nutrients, and the high faunal diversity -- that exists when sufficient patches of native biomes are preserved -- helps fight against plagues. Both India and China are still countries of so-called \"Megadiversity\", even with more than a billion people each and such long history. We, Westerners, on the other hand, are destroying our fertile land in an alarming rate, as you can see with deforestation/desavannization in Brazil and many other countries in the Americas, places with far less people, and far less time of \"civilization\".<\/p>\n\n<p>But, of course, all of this is only feasible in a world with a substantial peasantry, and not one who follows the machine-guided + urbanization philosophy that rules in Western world today.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, some patches of land will naturally have more nutrients than others. That's why there has ever been \"good lands\" and \"poor lands\". And since we want to use them all to survive, we may end up using some chemical help here and there.

Also, it depends on what you mean with \"attack\". <\/p>\n\n<p>As a really short introduction to what viruses are, they are very unlike your body cells or bacteria. They are literally (usually) just genetic information with a kind of shell. The shell allows them to penetrate cells, where they then use the cell itself to produce more viruses. That's all they do, reproduce. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, what do I mean with different \"modes of attack\" - well, different viruses lead to different things. For example, infections with <em>Herpes simplex<\/em> are <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">often asymptotic and many people have no idea that they are infected<\/a>. If you get the flu, however, you will notice. <\/p>\n\n<p>Every virus that can infect humans will <em>try<\/em> to spread as soon as it enters the body. It won't linger around and wait - HIV <a href=\"https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/just-diagnosed-with-hiv-aids/hiv-in-your-body/stages-of-hiv/\" rel=\"nofollow\">directly targets immune cells<\/a>, herpes directly targets nerve cells. The reproduction does takes time, but if they start reproducing and the immune system can't destroy them immediately symptoms can follow soon (think influenza) or late (HIV/AIDS). With most viral infections, the immune system at one point catches up and destroys the virus. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like is it improbable I have inhaled a virus if I do not feel pain in my lungs?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm going to assume you mean either the virus responsible for colds (rhinovirus) or the flu (influenza) here. No, it's perfectly normal to be exposed to either of these viruses without noticing anything. Many people come into contact with infected people without ever showing any symptoms, because their immune system takes care of the infection before any symptoms show up. If it <em>does<\/em> show up, it will be within a matter of days, though.

In the distant past, I think most evolutionary anthropologists and their like bought into the idea that humans were completely uniquely intelligent and spiritual.  But the more we try to define human sensibilities apart from other animals, the more we find its difficult to see animals as being completely incapable of human feelings and even thoughts. <\/p>\n\n<p>I refer you to this question which describes the shift in intelligence theories over the years: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6827/why-have-humans-evolved-conciousness/6831#6831\">Why have humans evolved conciousness?<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The above reference is just to say that every definition of intelligence that is fairly broad has been overturned by animals (thumbs, socialization, tool use, self awareness, communication and language). <\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to say <em>'I know we're special, but I just can't say how'<\/em> you are in lots of good company... it's become pretty hard to lay down a definition that includes all human beings and excludes animals.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Lately it seems as if the definition of spiritual experience is similarly hard to define. What is your definition?  The <em>capacity to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/cat-adopts-hedgehog-babies_n_2066996.html\">receive and reciprocate affection or love<\/a><\/em> is almost never brought up - <a href=\"http://weruletheinternet.com/2011/05/06/22-pictures-of-dogs-and-cats-sleeping-together/\">that seems to be half of the internet<\/a>.  Yet, that's a common component to many ideas of spirituality.   It was found a while ago that <em>primates have some form of self-awareness<\/em> to identify themselves as distinct from other individuals.  True this was only demonstrating that they <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test#Reactions_of_other_animals_to_mirrors\">know themselves in a mirror<\/a>, but other experiments show it probably is deeper than just that.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think the most confounding evidence is the work with animals who have been trained from infanthood to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/05/14/mf.animals.that.could.talk/index.html\">communicate to humans<\/a> through sign language or symbols.  The most astounding example I know if is Koko the gorilla. She had the vocabulary of a 5 year old and the capacity to joke around, reason, and adopted pets as children including a cat called All Ball.  When All Ball who was killed by a car she <em>mourned and remembered<\/em> her adopted cat for years.  This <a href=\"http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Speciesism/Case4Personhood.htm\">page<\/a> outlines all that, though there is a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0307472205\">book<\/a> that describes Koko's life.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The human staff sought to discover what Koko thought about death.  So they asked, \u201cWhere do gorillas go when they die?\u201d  Koko answered, \u201cComfortable / hole / goodbye.\u201d\n  They asked, \u201cWhen do gorillas die?\u201d  Koko answered, \u201cTrouble / old.\u201d\n  They asked, \u201cHow do gorillas feel when they die:  happy, sad, afraid?\u201d  Koko answered, \u201cSleep.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So this has been taken as evidence that gorillas have a <em>concept of their own mortality<\/em> or possibly even life after death.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So what is left?  Not clear to me.  Any thoughts? <\/p>\n\n<p>Some regions of the brain and control of electrical activity in the brain have been associated with spiritual experiences or acts like prayer and meditation.  The temporal lobe is exciting because <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/godonbrain.shtml\">magnetic stimulation of that region can create the sensation that there is a presence in the room with you<\/a>. there appear to be many regions which are active in different instances though, which is something you might expect.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There is no evidence yet that animals do not experience similar effects in their brains, though primates have very much the same structures as we do.

While the strength of the EEG is indeed weak, it is readily observable with even such comparatively primitive technology.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first thing you should take note of is that EEG measures the aggregate field. It does not see single neurons. It sees the synchronized activity of large neural populations of neurons - tens, hundreds of thousands of neurons at the very least, and probably more on the order of tens and hundreds of millions of neurons. This aggregate activity creates activity on the order of microvolts. This activity is then relayed (via the <em>differential amplifier<\/em> technique) to a powerful amplifiers. Modern EEG amplifiers have very large input impedances, and are thus able to amplify these weak signals. However, it still only observes mass action of large groups of neurons, not e.g. single action potentials by single cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, direct EEG analysis is comparatively uninformative for many reasons, including those you mention: that the scalp, the skull, and the other intervening tissue attenuate the signal. Thus, very often, extensive preprocessing is applied, such as averaging over many recordings. However, at least two features are already visible in the waking EEG. The first is the power-law structure of the frequency spectrum (although this is reinforced by the filtering characteristics of the tissue; the tissue filters higher frequencies more than lower ones). The second is the alpha wave, which is a large activity pattern coming mostly from visual areas. However, this is a very coarse feature; it tells us little beyond if the subject has their eyes open and is attentive, or has them closed/is inattentive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, it is indeed generally assumed that deep sources (such as subcortical areas) are not picked up by the EEG (but only by e.g. MEG).<\/p>\n\n<p>A good introduction to the topic is the book <em>Electroencephalography<\/em> by Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41699,"question_id":41690,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cfded303185c63e33dc664f3228c4de7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6887,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6887/user-49102","reputation":264,"display_name":"user 49102"},"score":0,"post_id":41700,"edited":false,"creation_date":1450820983,"comment_id":70918,"body":"&quot;Hence, the magic hat of an electrophysiologist is needed to extract the signal on the scalp from the noise by using noise reduction techniques such as signal averaging and filtering&quot; Don&#39;t overstate this - alpha waves are readily observable in raw EEG traces baring any filtering or averaging."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cfded303185c63e33dc664f3228c4de7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6887,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6887/user-49102","reputation":264,"display_name":"user 49102"},"score":0,"post_id":41700,"edited":false,"creation_date":1450821322,"comment_id":70920,"body":"I&#39;d phrase it as saying that to display specific, complex neural patterns, such techniques are necessary; but try to avoid the impression that you could not observe any neural activity at all without them.

Worse, still, the electrical fields <strong>diffuse<\/strong> on their way to the scalp, meaning that adjacent patches of neurons cannot reliably be distinguished at the scalp. In other words, the <strong>spatial resolution of the EEG is very poor<\/strong>. The small amplitude of the potentials simply needs <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplification\" rel=\"nofollow\">signal amplification<\/a><\/strong> to make them measurable. However, as @user49102 points out nicely, background noise is amplified with it. Hence, the magic hat of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiological_techniques_for_clinical_diagnosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">electrophysiologist<\/a> may be needed to extract the signal on the scalp from the noise by using noise reduction techniques such as <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_averaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">signal averaging<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://erpinfo.org/erplab/erplab-documentation/documentation-archive-for-previous-versions/v3.x-documentation/tutorial/Filtering.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">filtering<\/a><\/strong>. A notable example where signal averaging is used is the event-related potential, or ERP. A stimulus (e.g. a flash of light) is repeatedly presented and the time-locked EEG is repeatedly measured and averaged offline. The random noise is reduced by the averaging process and neat ERP responses can be extracted without much filtering needed. A specialized example is the visual evoked potential, or VEP (Fig. 2):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/soqOg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/soqOg.png\" alt=\"VEP\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>VEP.

The skin cells do not generate action potentials and feature only steady membrane potentials. Hence, if they are picked up by the electrodes it will only generate a stable offset, i.e., a baseline shift. Nothing to worry about. Neurons feature active potential <em>differences<\/em> through their action potentials, and that is what is picked up - voltage differences.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The low spatial resolution and weak signal means that the activity of single neurons cannot be measured. Instead, the <strong>gross signal from many thousands of neurons is collectively measured<\/strong>. In turn, when those neurons fire randomly, they will cancel each other's responses out and little signal is obtained. The most robust responses are obtained when the brain generates <strong>synchronized oscillatory potentials<\/strong>, for example during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-wave_sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">slow-wave sleep<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Roth, 2009)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>While EEG has poor spatial resolution of EEG, it <strong>excels in the temporal domain<\/strong>.

As MattDMo points out, some of the original answer was poor in it's presentation. In my update there's some supporting information to some expert testimonial, but this is mainly targeted at adult cases rather than pediatric cases, i.e. why would cardiac cancer be rare in an adult with no prior history of cancer. There's a reference #5 at the bottom which goes into some of the genetic conditions that result in rhabdomyocarcoma.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cardiac muscle cells do not divide particularly often (though they may divide: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19342590\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans<\/a>). This would be a good mechanism of resistance of heart tissue to a more typical or rapid cancer development, compared to say, the endothelium of a vessel or an interstitial/connective tissue cell. Not to say heart tumors are impossible, either, as rhabdomyocarcoma is a good example of a cardiac tumor. Moreover, here's an excerpt from <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/rhabdomyosarcomas-and-other-heart-cancers-are-so-extremely-rare-its-if-they-didnt-310714\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article on heart cancer:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of fatty tissue [in the heart],\u201d Gaynor said. Even more, \u201cthe heart\u2019s enclosed in a membrane,\u201d he explained. Known as the pericardium, this fluid-filled sac may itself become engulfed by cancer, with tumors metastasizing to the outside of it, but still it does its job of protecting our precious hearts.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>So, even though cancer can happen anywhere there are cells, your heart remains virtually immune due to its muscular nature and the assistance of the pericardium. Smart heart.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And then from <a href=\"http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/6/dju177\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancer Prognosis: Role of BMI and Fat Tissue<\/a>,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many prospective clinical trials have linked excess body weight\u2014typically represented as a BMI of 25kg/m2 of body surface area or greater\u2014with a higher risk of development of cancers, including postmenopausal breast cancer in women and esophageal, colon, pancreatic, endometrial, and kidney cancers in both sexes. The number of obese Americans will increase by an estimated 65 million by 2030, increasing cancer diagnoses by 500,000 (Lancet 2011;378:815\u201325).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So fat content has it's role in progressing cancers, determinately. Let's explore this part. The adipocyte isn't simply a storage for fat, it has it's own host of proteins it produces and secretes. In obesity, the adipose tissue becomes dysregulated in it's secretion of adipokines [<a href=\"http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/24/2959\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>]. The book <em>Adipose Tissue and Cancer<\/em> by M. Kolonin, the author notes that two major adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, play a major role in tumorigenesis by induction of cell survival and proliferation pathways [<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2Uy6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Adipokines:+soluble+factors+from+adipose+tissue+implicated+in+cancer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAGoVChMIwMe9k7q9xwIVSlseCh2i2Qnh#v=onepage&amp;q=Adipokines%3A%20soluble%20factors%20from%20adipose%20tissue%20implicated%20in%20cancer&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>]. Also duly noted, increased circulating insulin and insulin-like growth factors due to insulin resistance results in mitogenic effects on tumor cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>White adipose tissue has been shown by Pedro et al. to increase bioavailability of sex hormones such as estradiol, through increased aromatase activity and  \"increased insulin and bioactive IGF-1 levels which downregulate the concentration of the circulating sex hormone-binding globulin, resulting in an increased fraction of bioavailable estradiol, but decreased testosterone production.\" The same study has a section on inflammation induced by adipose tissue in section 3.2, the entire article is rather long but they sum up some of the information into a figure,<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yEpqm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yEpqm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272810007620\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source: Pedro et al.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, and in reference to the expert testimonial above from Dr. Gaynor, the heart isn't a very fatty organ, and it's protected from the surrounding adipose tissue by the pericardium. You could also argue that the fast flow of blood through the heart would leave a smaller fraction of circulating tumorigenic molecules for ready uptake by cardiac cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>Being said, and while I haven't any data for the molecular pathogenesis for cardiac tumors, nondividing epidermal cells have been shown to enter a proliferative state in response to inflammation [<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/46/19903.full?sid=5ce4f379-5465-4f57-817c-82bd338baa91\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>]. We also see that adipokines have been implicated in heart disease due to pro-inflammatory effects [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355497\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>]. My concession here is that the rarity of cancers in adult cardiac muscle cells is because this process is very slow, and it's aided in part by the sort of environment the heart finds itself in. We often see cases of cardiac tumors in children due to errors in development [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12094-007-0079-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">5<\/a>].<\/p>\n","answer_id":37045,"question_id":37044,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1440277946}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37044/cancer-in-myogenic-heart-cells","last_activity_date":1450655219,"creation_date":1440172096,"answer_count":1,"title":"Cancer in myogenic heart cells?","body":"<p>Why cancer does not occur in myogenic heart cells?

In contrast, rods are hardwired to converge onto a single optic fiber to collect responses for dim lighting (scotopic, or night vision). Because many rods (tens of rods) connect to a single optic nerve fiber, the spatial acuity is dramatically reduced (Fig. 3). Hence, you can read with only a few degrees of your vision. While reading, your eyes continuously scan the page for the next word to center it onto the foveal region.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yGk8l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yGk8l.jpg\" alt=\"rod &amp; cone wiring\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 3.

It relies a lot on mathematical modelling (incl. statistics and probability theory) and numerical modelling. You might for example want to have a look at Population Genetics and Quantitative Genetics which are at the core of evolutionary Biology.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What are we good at predicting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Here are a few examples of things we can predict. We can predict how many pairwise differences (or other measures of molecular differentiation) do we expect between two lineages that recently split in a given number of years. We can predict how many mutations of a given fitness effects (whether beneficial or deleterious) do we expect to accumulate over a given period of time in a population. We can make also some predictions about the evolution of multicellularity, sociality, etc. in lineages that are limit-cases (relating again to our ability at a short time only). We can make predictions about the speed of evolution measured in Haldanes or in Darwins (these are units) if we know the genes involved and the heritability of the trait of interest. We can predict the heterozygosity of a structured population. I could cite many other examples. Generally speaking, we have good predictive abilities at short time scale OR for neutral sequences OR for conserved (DNA) regions (strong purifying selection).<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, we can predict a lot of things but by far not everything yet.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What are we bad at predicting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I would suggest to decompose the reasons for why predictions can be hard into the following categories. However, I might well forget something and one could argue that my semantic is less helpful some other semantic.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Environment\n\n<ul>\n<li>One issue related to make predictions at long time scale is that the environment changes through time in a way that we are not able to predict accurately enough yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Noise\n\n<ul>\n<li>I am not here talking about measurement error or sampling error (these are concept of statistics you may want to check if you don't know them), I am talking about the stochastic process that are inherent to biological systems such as the randomness of mutation processes and genetic drift.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Genotype-phenotype map\n\n<ul>\n<li>We have too little understanding of molecular genetics in order to be able to predict how different specific mutation would affect the phenotype. As a consequence, we today still have very little predictive power about the evolution of a phenotypic trait that is currently totally inexistent.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Complex systems\n\n<ul>\n<li>For example: demography affects evolution which affects the social environments, which affects demography which affects pattern of species competitions which affects the evolution of another species which affects its demography which affects the evolution of a third species which affects the demography of our first species, etc... These kind of complex systems are often mathematically not tractable.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Parameters\n\n<ul>\n<li>We often don't know the exact parameters of the lineage we are interested in. There is a lot of measures to take to be able to make predictions and we often don't have the money (or the time) to make all these measurements (assuming we are able to accurately measure them). For this reason, we are often relatively good to make predictions for a few model organisms but pretty bad for the vast majority of species.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>I apologize for my total lack of reference but it would take hours to search references for every claim<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>General Advice<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The best way to learn about evolution and to answer your own questions (or help you to ask more accurate questions) is to actually take a short course. <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/home.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding Evolution<\/a> by UC Berkeley is probably a good place to start.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39173,"question_id":39166,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1450547891},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b6b9a718327238bdf614a9855f438640?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6134,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6134/petersoapes","reputation":195,"display_name":"petersoapes","accept_rate":75},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1450636047,"creation_date":1443632572,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Can we tell if a species will develop a specific character, based on the environment they're in?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a major part of what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">quantitative genetics<\/a> does. Or more detailedly, quantitative genetics can predict, for a population, changes in a trait given a selection pressure. First of all, for evolution to occur there must be variation in the trait you are making predictions about. Secondly the accuracy of the scale of the predictions matter greatly for the evolutionary model to be tested (eg, \"Will body size increase?\" vs \"Will incisors increase 3mm in 300 generations?\").<\/p>\n\n<p>Several things have to be known to predict the evolution of a given trait:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The number of genetic sites controlling this trait (QTL, or quantitative trait loci). If the all the loci for a trait are known, the nucleotide heterogeneity within the population of those sites can be quantified. The number of genetic loci are important for estimating how often they will change from new mutations.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The effect of each genetic locus on contributing to variation to the trait (additive genetic effects).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The heritability of the genetics controlling this trait, (does the environment contribute to variation in the trait (low heritability) or do genetic differences cause more variation in the trait).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The strength and consistency of selection  (how fit are individuals in that environment along to phenotypic distribution compared to previous generations).

Just as predicting the future is possible with the laws of physics if you know the position of every atom in the universe.

Specifically our lungs inflate by using \"<a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-negative-pressure.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">negative pressure<\/a>\" (a word I've always hated). The pressure is not actually negative it is simply lower than the surroundings. Since there is less air in your lungs the air from the atmosphere rushes in because the pressure is higher outside your lungs. This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boyle's Law<\/a> (not the pressure outside being higher, but what happens when your lungs expand). Where an increase in Volume means a decrease in Pressure (if all else remains unchanged). In fact plants pull water up using negative pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>However to push out the air from our lungs we supply pressure using our muscles that overcomes the outside pressure and forces the air out.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason you feel your breathing change is because when that train passes by you correctly observed the strong gust of wind. This gust of wind has some force behind it that normally is not in the air you are breathing from the atmosphere. It has more force which increases the air's velocity.

For any chemical reaction to happen you need to break some existing bonds in order to form new bonds. Breaking existing bonds consumes some energy; in other words you have to convert the reactant to an active form which undergoes a reaction readily. The energy that is required to do so is called activation energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is essential to note that activation energy is an empirical term because it does not actually consider the reaction mechanism. The above example of bond-breaking and re-formation can happen in many ways. Some mechanisms may require less activation energy than the others. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Arrhenius equation denotes the relationship between reaction rate and activation energy:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$k=Ae^{-\\frac{E_a}{RT}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>where $k$ is the reaction rate constant, $A$ is the Arrhenius constant (an arbitrary proportionality constant), $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. <\/p>\n\n<p>This equation tells you that the rate of reaction decreases with increase in activation energy and increases with increase in temperature.<\/p>\n\n<p>The temperature indicates the internal energy of the system i.e. the movement of molecules. Collision between molecules is essential for chemical reaction to happen and increased temperature increases the chance of collisions (due to higher molecular movement).<\/p>\n\n<hr> \n\n<p><strong>How do enzymes lower activation energy of a reaction?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>They either do that by increasing the chance of interaction between the reactants or diverting the reaction to follow a different mechanism that has a lower activation energy. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you know, the enzyme binds to the reactants and forms a complex. This effectively brings the reactants closer thereby increasing the probability of their \"collision\" which in turn increases the reaction rate. This can be further extended to the level of molecular orientation. The analogy presented by AMR in their comment is great. It is one of the mechanisms by which the free energy of the system would increase &mdash; by reduction of entropy. Clamping the substrate in place can expose its reactive groups to the co-reactants, thereby allowing the reaction to proceed faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>In most other mechanisms of enzyme catalysis, the functional groups in the enzyme active site react with the substrate to form intermediates and these intermediates which have lower activation energy give rise to product faster than the substrate in absence of the enzyme. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is to be noted that this entire process of catalysis adds a few extra steps to the actual reaction (binding,  formation of intermediates etc). The catalyst would be effective only if these combined rates are still faster than that of the uncatalyzed reaction. <\/p>\n","answer_id":38934,"question_id":38902,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38902/what-is-a-detailed-chemical-explanation-for-describing-how-an-enzyme-may-lower-t","last_activity_date":1450531243,"creation_date":1442628909,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is a detailed chemical explanation for describing how an enzyme may lower the activation energy of a reaction?","body":"<p>If you can provide some sound reasoning that touches on tertiary structures of proteins and does not use a lot of advanced chemistry jargon that might be really helpful, especially for an intro biology student.

Most reactions with NAD(P)H go like NADPH + H+ + (oxidized compound) --> NAD(P)+ + (reduced compound). In fact, in most reaction mechanisms the hydrogen that's actually on the NADPH is ends up covalently bonded to the reduced compound.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, acid-base reactions are some of the fastest reactions that can occur in the cell. The cellular environment is pH buffered, so any excess H+ ions would be rapidly taken up by the excess of buffering agents which are floating around in the cell. Likewise, when a hydrogen ion is needed in a reaction, it's pulled from the general pool of free hydrogen ions, and it is rapidly replaced from that same pool of buffering agents. As a consequence of this, it normally doesn't make much sense to talk about where hydrogen ions flow in the cell - there's just a general hydrogen ion pool which supplies and takes up any hydrogen ions that are needed/produced by the reactions in the cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>The big exception to this is where hydrogen ion movement is restricted by things like membranes. The TCA cycle and the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis being major examples of this. In those situations hydrogen ions are pumped across the membrane during the reaction, and there <em>is<\/em> a distinction between hydrogen ions \"inside\" and \"outside\" the membrane. But there isn't any distinction between any of the hydrogens on one particular side of the membrane.<\/p>\n\n<p>The light independent reactions of the Calvin cycle, though, happen within the chloroplast stroma and don't pump hydrogen ions across the membrane. So the hydrogen ions generated/consumed by these reactions go into/come from the general stromal pool of hydrogen ions. Here they can be used by any reaction that requires/generates hydrogen ions - a major one of these would be the light-dependent reactions, which take hydrogen ions from the stroma and pump them to the lumen (and then release them back to capture the energy for phosphorylation). But the hydrogen atoms from the Calvin cycle enzymes aren't in any way \"earmarked\" for the light dependent reactions.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39786,"question_id":39445,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39445/what-happens-to-h-when-glycerate-3-phosphate-is-converted-to-triose-phosphate","last_activity_date":1450508797,"creation_date":1444492567,"answer_count":1,"title":"What happens to H+ when Glycerate 3-Phosphate is converted to Triose Phosphate?","body":"<p>The conversion from Glycerate 3-Phosphate to Triose Phosphate requires:<\/p>\n\n<p>$ATP \\rightarrow ADP + P_i$<\/p>\n\n<p>$NADPH \\rightarrow NADP + H^+$<\/p>\n\n<p>So what happens to the $H^+$? <\/p>\n\n<p>Is it in-effect \"recycled\" back to the Light Dependent reaction.<\/p>\n","question_id":39445,"tags":["photosynthesis","light"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":39786,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1447913639},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18f18ce255fa3d3a99ed127f9a70aad5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5688,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5688/questionhang","reputation":260,"display_name":"questionhang","accept_rate":33},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a51980d404d08ba2b8c640ce12120c88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17617,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17617/bshane","reputation":1739,"display_name":"bshane"},"score":1,"post_id":41507,"edited":false,"creation_date":1450087131,"comment_id":70438,"body":"@questionhang: The general technique with dinosaurs is to count the rings in bones, although there are limitations to the method.

I am not sure what measure to use in my calculations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The enzyme assay with seven calibrators produces a very nice dose-response that I fit with a nonlinear regression model (4-parameter aka. Hill equation). Running blank samples gives three relevant measures that I could use to calculate LOB, LOD, LOQ:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Raw absorbance at 405 nm\n\n<ul>\n<li>Problem here is absorbance increases over time as the enzyme goes to town on substrate. Results across multiple experiments are not comparable. Not a good candidate.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Normalized enzyme activity (as a % of uninhibited control)\n\n<ul>\n<li>I like this option the best because it's not time-dependent. Blanks run on various days are comparable. <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Concentration (ng/mL)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Concentration is interpolated on calibration curve using % activity as the input. Problem here is sometimes the nonlinear model cannot calculate results that are beyond the upper asymptote (parameter A for those familiar with the Hill equation). So roughly half of my blanks don't get a concentration.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I feel like I want to proceed using % activity as my measure for calculating LOB, LOD and LOQ but it just doesn't feel right. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example, my 20 blanks run over 8 experiments have an average enzyme activity of 99.4% and standard deviation is 2.2%. If I calculate LOB the traditional way LOB = mean of blank + 1.645*SD of blank, I get 103% which doesn't make sense (it should be mean - 1.645*SD instead, which gives 95.7%). First red flag.<\/p>\n\n<p>I need to report my LOB, LOD and LOQ to external stakeholders. No one is going to understand what it means when I say my LOB is 95.7% activity, LOD is 92.1% activity, and LOQ is 77.2% activity. They'll want the limits expressed in terms of analyte concentration. <\/p>\n\n<p>But... to go from % activity to ng/mL, I have to interpolate on my calibration curve. But I got the data from 8 separate experiments. Am I supposed to average out the curves for the 8 experiments and use that to turn % activity into concentration? <\/p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate some help on this one. Everyone in my lab is pure analytical chemistry and they don't get the whole enzyme thing. <\/p>\n","question_id":41619,"tags":["enzymes","methods","assay-development"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":107,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1450481456},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b6a39ad5c91ec750189b71a6122af94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19679,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19679/user19679","reputation":286,"display_name":"user19679"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/INPrd.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16651,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16651/amr","reputation":4081,"display_name":"AMR"},"score":6,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b6a39ad5c91ec750189b71a6122af94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19679,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19679/user19679","reputation":286,"display_name":"user19679"},"score":0,"post_id":41597,"edited":false,"creation_date":1450398458,"comment_id":70672,"body":"+1 Good answer!

This is beyond the objective nature of science.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please be aware, that as you are making this question specifically about criminal evidence, I am addressing that aspect of your question. There are ways of dealing with and presenting evidence that may preclude the need for any scientific proof of age, as it is up to the determination of reasonableness by the jury that is the overriding factor. If the jury does not reasonably feel that the person depicted is a minor as may be the case if the actual identity of the victim cannot be established, or if the accused could not have reasonably known that the person was a minor, unable of providing legal consent, then they can vote to acquit the accused.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newtactics.org/comment/7436#comment-7436\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video\u2019s Role in the Criminal Justice Process: DRC to ICC<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since documentary and forensic evidence could not prove age, the Prosecutor relied, in part, on a series of video clips showing: i) Lubanga at the military training camps speaking to children; and ii) children serving as his bodyguards. A sample of the footage from the opening argument can be watched here and below.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You will also see if you follow this link that the normal clinical determinant of age, examination of growth plates is not relevant as that data was generated on American and European populations and is likely different for African children, as their access to nutrition and the childhood illnesses that they face likely have much more to do with the changes in bone plates that can be used to determine age forensically.<\/p>\n\n<p>While this example is related to an international court of law hearing a war crimes tribunal, the charge given to most juries would be that they are the judges of the facts and if a reasonable person would arrive at a certain conclusion.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/criminal/default.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">From the Connecticut Supreme Court Jury Instructions<\/a>.

That evidence will consist of the testimony of witnesses, documents and other material admitted into evidence as exhibits, and any facts on which the lawyers agree or that I may instruct you to accept.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The following are not evidence and you must not consider them as evidence in deciding the facts of this case:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>statements and arguments by the attorneys,\n  questions and objections of the attorneys, and\n  testimony that I instruct you to disregard.\n  There are two kinds of evidence: direct and circumstantial. Direct evidence is testimony by a witness about what that witness personally saw or heard or did. Circumstantial evidence is indirect evidence; that is, it is evidence from which you can infer another fact. As an example: if you wake up in the morning and see that the sidewalk is wet, you may infer that it rained during the night. The wet sidewalk is circumstantial evidence that it rained. Other evidence, however, may provide another explanation for the water on the sidewalk, such as a garden hose that was left on overnight. Therefore, before you decide that a fact has been proved by circumstantial evidence, you must consider all the evidence in the light of reason, experience and common sense.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In deciding this case, you may consider both direct and circumstantial evidence. The law permits you to give equal weight to both, but it is for you to decide how much weight to give to any evidence.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Some evidence may be admitted for a limited purpose only. When I instruct you that a piece of evidence has been admitted for a limited purpose, you must consider it only for that purpose and for no other.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/criminal/part2/2.2-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.2-3  Reasonable Doubt<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable.  It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture.1  It is not a doubt raised by anyone simply for the sake of raising a doubt.  It is such a doubt as, in serious affairs that concern you, you would heed; that is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance.2  It is not hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy for the accused or any other person who might be affected by your decision.  It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence.3  It is doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.4<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>EDIT: Due to a moderator edit of the question, the following section is no longer valid to the question and has been stricken<\/h3>\n\n<p><strike>As you can see from this statute <a href=\"http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/criminal/part7/7.4-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">7.4-3  Obscenity as to Minors -- § 53a-196<\/a> it is up to the discretion of the jury to determine whether or not the person depicted in the video was a minor and that the person accused of the crime knew that the person was a minor. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>In summary, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 1) the (material / performance) was obscene as to minors, 2) the defendant promoted the (materials / performance) to another person, knowing of its character and contents, and 3) knew that the other person was a minor.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If you unanimously find that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the crime of obscenity as to minors, then you shall find the defendant guilty.

This loosening of the antagonist while the agonist is being contracted is referred to as <em>reciprocal inhibition<\/em> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8299401\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Crone, 1993)<\/a>. More important to the question is the fact that the <strong><em>motor response is well under way before<\/em><\/strong> the signals responsible for the <strong><em>conscious sensation of pain<\/em><\/strong> (which exit the reflex pathway in the spinal cord) ever reach the brain (<a href=\"https://www.biog1445.org/demo/09/reflexarc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cornell University<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVbCV.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVbCV.png\" alt=\"![reflex arc\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

The only possible way to suppress a reflex that is faster than perception is to start counteracting the agonist (flexor) before the reflex is initiated, i.e., by contracting the antagonist (extensor) before touching the painful object. <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8299401\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crone, <em>Dan Med Bull<\/em> (1993); <strong>40<\/strong>(5): 571-81<\/a><\/sub> <\/p>\n","answer_id":41584,"question_id":39768,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1450390759}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39768/how-are-reflexes-suppressed","last_activity_date":1450390759,"creation_date":1445265397,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are reflexes suppressed?","body":"<p>What neurophysiological process keeps reflex arcs in check?

I&#39;m going to read it"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1450374496,"creation_date":1450352611,"body":"<p>I believe what you are referring to is called 'sympathetic pain,'and the reason you can't find any papers on the subject is because it is not really a well studied concept. That is primarily due to the lack of robustness in the sensation and idiosyncratic nature of the phenomenon. Personally, I'm not too familiar with the concept beyond placebo treatment of patients with such pains.<\/p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, I will explain the different types of pains briefly, their biology, and where the pain you have described fits roughly. There are three categories of pain (scientists sometimes argue four, but for our sake let's say three): nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is the immediate pain reaction you get when you sense something harmful. It's that jerking sensation you get when you touch something hot or you feel something hazardous coming your way. This pain comes from peripheral nerves that link your senses of touch or perception directly to your spinal chord for an immediate knee jerk reaction. Thus, there is no central nervous system (or brain) processing of the pain, just a reaction. You end up feeling the pain more intensely later once the moment has passed. Then inflammatory pain is the pain you get when you cut or bruise yourself, have allergies, stuffy nose, ect. It is the more common and treatable types of pain and is easy to detect. It comes with redness, swelling, and sensitivity to the general area. Biologically your body is stimulating this pain because your inflammatory system is trying to attack any invasive particles or repair damaged sections of the body. There has been much research done in this type of pain (see sources) and is treatable with non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, Tylenol, ect.<\/p>\n\n<p>The last type of pain, which is the sympathetic pain falls into, is called neuropathic pain. This pain is more abstract and is often described as constant and idiosyncratic (non standard intervals). In research it is often modeled by inducing diabetes and doing damage to the nerves to cause constant pain signals to the brain. However, the method is controversial in both practice and in efficiency of modeling. This because there are often many different biological ways to induce cognitive pain and it is primarily central nervous system based (aka in the brain), whereas this type of pain is specifically induced by nerve damage (hence neuropathic). This type of pain is often tested using cognitive based test parameters to see if a drug can relieve some of the mental struggles either caused by the pain or causing the pain. There are also such cells called \"mirror neurons\" that fire when you sense (visual, audio, touch) something and then cause a similar behavior or sensation to occur within the person. It is possible that seeing or feeling someone else's pain causes these mirror neurons to fire for certain people, perhaps due to associate learning or a memory that person has that reminds them of pain they once had. I've attached some literature on the subject for your leisure, but it is a poorly understood science that we are trying to grasp in modern research.
