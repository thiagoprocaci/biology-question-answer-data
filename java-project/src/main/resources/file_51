Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident. HF interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful.

Burns with areas larger than 25 square inches (160 cm2) have the potential to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels.

Although you clearly already realize this, I will make it explicit: osteoblasts are the cells that create new bone; osteoclasts break down (<em>resorb<\/em>) bone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quoting <em>Harrison\u2019s Internal Medicine<\/em><sup>1<\/sup>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Radioisotope studies indicate that as much as 18% of the total skeletal calcium is deposited and removed each year. Thus, bone is an active metabolizing tissue.\u2026The cycle of bone resorption and formation is a highly orchestrated process carried out by the basic multicellular unit, which is composed of a group of osteoclasts and osteoblasts <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Bone mineral density (BMD) can not be equated with bone <em>quality<\/em>. (This is the difference between osteoporosis \u2013 deficient bone density \u2013 and rickets \u2013 poor bone architecture.) Thus, vitamin D\u2019s stimulation of both osteoblast and osteoclast activity is beneficial to bone structure.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>b) How does vitamin D lead to overall increased bone density?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the effects above, you mentioned that vitamin D increases serum calcium by several mechanisms. This is true. Both this increased serum calcium as well as the direct effects of Vitamin D on the parathyroid gland suppress PTH production.* As PTH has powerful actions to increase bone resorption by mobilizing calcium and phosphorus to move from the bone into the blood, the suppression on its excretion applied both directly and indirectly by Vitamin D results in a net increase in bone density.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, both by its effects on bone <em>quality<\/em> and <em>quantity<\/em>, vitamin D is a net boon for the bones. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>\n*Parathyroid hormone, a.k.a. parathormone.

I certainly do not know but I'll offer up two hypotheses. <\/p>\n\n<p>My first hypothesis is that the elongated nose is a remnant of the elongated lower face of our ancestral species, as you note in your answer. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFY_KPFS3LA\" rel=\"nofollow\">this brief YouTube video<\/a> (1:17 long, the part relevant to this answer begins at 33 seconds) of a time-lapse composite showing the develop of the human face. Our face develops as two separate halves that meet together in the middle. That's what creates the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philtrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">philtrum under our nose<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Watch the especially carefully from the 54 second mark to 1 minute mark. Note that our nostrils are pointing directly forward and the overall region looks somewhat like a pig snout. The mouth is vertical aligned with the front of the nose. The overall face is much more rectangular and the eyes are on the sides of the face.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, the face begins to become rounder and flatten. The eyes move to the front of the face and the recesses our our eye sockets recede. The lower face below the nose recedes, becoming flatter. The only part that does not recede is the nose area. The flattening of the lower face may actually cause the nostrils to turn downward.  Our nose does not develop outward from a flat face but instead is left behind as the rest of the face flattens.  This would be my initial thought as the <em>primary<\/em> reason for the shape of the nose and direction of the nostrils.<\/p>\n\n<p>My second hypothesis (and honestly independent of the comment by @Remib) is related to our sense of smell and taste. Although our ability to detect flavors is a complex process, the primary sense involved is smell (<a href=\"http://www.cajal.csic.es/actividades2011/smell-images.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shepherd 2006<\/a>). Therefore, downward-pointing nostrils are located directly above the mouth so we get a good smell of the food just before it enters the mouth, perhaps enhancing our flavor-sensing ability.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shephered, G.M. 2006. Smell images and the flavour system in the human brain. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/abs/nature05405.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature 444: 316-321<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The downward pointing nostrils may be a remnant of our facial development but provides an (adaptive?) advantage for flavour perception.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20926,"question_id":20915,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd9f511d93e05e30a61706c29f4e9d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":15792,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15792/chris-soice","reputation":1,"display_name":"Chris Soice"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/04dpm.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8129,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8129/matas-vaitkevicius","reputation":263,"display_name":"Matas Vaitkevicius","accept_rate":71},"score":1,"post_id":34341,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431975853,"comment_id":54955,"body":"Could you point to the source please."}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1431973395,"creation_date":1431973395,"body":"<p>Ive found that the study of this feature, the nose is far from complete.Although we see the evolution of other mammals and their faces has a great deal to do with there ability to survive different enviornments I believe it , our snozz is a genetic mutation in which allows us the ability to go from nonaquatic to aquatic with out needing a snorkel. ?.by defying why we have this thing on our face......some so large some so small I dont believe to have much to do with ancestial deviation of the jaw but the defying feature of the human race.....thank you<\/p>\n","answer_id":34341,"question_id":20915,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20915/why-has-our-nose-evolved-with-the-nostrils-facing-down","last_activity_date":1431973395,"creation_date":1409505067,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why has our nose evolved with the nostrils facing down?","body":"<p>For most animals, the whole bottom of their face sticks out and they have a snout with a mouth and nose at the end.

There is most certainly better references and sources out there to explain this (please add better references if you know of any).<\/em><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If I understand you correctly, your question is why we do not see cell organelles in a cracked or boiled egg. If so, your question seems to stem from a misunderstanding of what the egg white and egg yolk represents. A chicken egg is not simply an enlarged cell, and the egg yolk is not the cell nucleus. <\/p>\n\n<p>When an oocyte matures in the chicken ovary, it stores yolk inside the cell and therefore enlarges. The yolk is therefore part of the oocyte cytoplasm. However, as it enlarges, the yolk is separated from the germinal disc, which holds all the other cell organelles (including the nucleus). The germinal disc is seen as a small white area on the egg yolk. Eventually, when the oocyte has accumulated enought yolk, it disattaches from the ovary (ovulation) and goes into the hens oviduct. This process is happening continuously, and oocytes of different stages of maturation are present on the ovary, which can be seen in this image:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJrdV.jpg\" alt=\"chicken reproductive tract, from chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/explore/embryology/day05/ovary.html\"><br>\n(image from <a href=\"http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/explore/embryology/day05/ovary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Chickscope: Formation of the Egg<\/em>. University of Illinios<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>When the oocyte passes through the oviduct it builds up layers of egg white (albumen) and other supporting structures. The shell is formed last in the shell gland, which is located at the end of the oviduct. Therefore, the egg white and the shell is formed externally of the oocyte and the egg yolk. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the reason why we do not see more structures in a boiled egg is that the majority of the egg is yolk and egg white, which are both structures to store energy ment for a growing embryo (mainly protein and fat). It should also be noted that oocytes in most (all?) animals contain yolk granules, but the storage of yolk is most extreme in birds (see <a href=\"http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20102/Bio%20102%20lectures/animal%20development/animal.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this webpage on animal development<\/a> from State university of New York for a short comparison).<\/p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that an egg that is fertilized will naturally contain more than one cell, since the embryo will have started growing. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/explore/embryology/day05/ovary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Chickscope: Formation of the Egg<\/em>.

It is something that everyone should consider, as the answer is not as self-evident as it may appear.  The responses here are excellent.  I would like to add a few things from a healthcare perspective.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This is the WHO recommendation<\/a> on how to wash your hands.  It is in agreement with the CDC recommendations. This includes use of antibacterial soaps.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason for friction in handwashing is as Chris and WYSIWYG said: removal of oils, dirt, bacteria and other things accumulated in the crevasses of your skin and nails (including microbes and biological residues). <\/p>\n\n<p>Regular soap on its own is a surfactant; it is a molecule with a polar end (and a non-polar end.  It basically dissolves in both oils and waters.  It is perfect for removing oils and rinsing them off in water.  Detergents such as soaps are cell membrane disrupters, and as such, it is capable of rupturing cell membranes of many microbes on its own.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Shigeta is right-on with the FDA recommendations to not use antibacterial soaps.  They are completely unnecessary is most situations and actually do harm by putting selective pressure on bacteria strains to become stronger by killing off all but the most resistant ones, which then breed and overgrow.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In daily use, alcohol foams are a convenient way to sanitize if soap and water are unavailable, but it's often overused.  Soap and water are better in the daily environment, and always better before eating, because alcohol does not kill spores nor denature toxins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overuse of antibiotics in general is the reason why MRSA and other multi-drug resistant bacteria have emerged, and these are extremely dangerous because they are so difficult to treat.  We're struggling to catch up with antibiotics to kill the newly emerging strands.  There are cases I have seen where all efforts to treat an infection failed due to resistance.  So I guess I'm saying all this to emphasize that yeah, it's important to not go overboard on antibacterial cleansing :)  /end soapbox.<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, one more quick thing - I do want to add that healthcare settings are slightly different.  The use of antibacterial soap in hospitals is approved for the purpose of reducing the microbial load on skin between patients, to reduce transmission as much as possible.  Alcohol foams have been found to be comparable, but are insufficient in several cases (such as spores). (See the CDC for more info on alcohol foams: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/hand.htm#a3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/hand.htm#a3<\/a>).\nIn daily use, alcohol foams are a convenient way to sanitize if soap and water are unavailable, but it's often overused.  Soap and water are better in the daily environment, and always better before eating, because alcohol does not kill spores nor denature toxins.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>References for following information:  I personally have been involved in patient counseling discussions in clinic with a patient and an attending physician (a supervisory teaching doctor) discussing best practices in hygiene.  This includes two dermatologists, two Emergency physicians, an OB/Gyn physician, and a pediatrician - and all concur:<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>For general washing in the shower, unless you sweat a great deal or are exposed to dirt and chemicals, the majority of your exposed skin does not require extensive scrubbing to become clean.  In fact, scrubbing can irritate skin, worsen dry skin, or exacerbate conditions such as eczema.   Warm water, normal soap (or even better for sensitive skin / eczema, moisturizing body wash like Dove), and a soft washcloth are completely sufficient. If using a pouf or exfoliator, only apply light pressure, never aggressive. Armpits, groin, and feet do require more attention, but hard scrubbing is unnecessary.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly (and hopefully not TMI in this post), I learned from the OB/Gyn's patient counseling that it is unnecessary (and actually irritating to the mucous membranes) for women to use more than warm water to clean between the labia majora. I looked this up and found supporting information for this. Other genital surfaces should be washed well, but as mucous membranes, that area has a self-cleaning system of secretions.  This is similar to the strong recommendation for women not to use vaginal douching - it upsets the balance of natural bacteria (flora) in the vaginal canal.<\/p>\n\n<p>The WHO handwashing instructions:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cUF62.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":16583,"question_id":15362,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1397630185}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15362/does-antibacterial-soap-work-chemically","last_activity_date":1431939087,"creation_date":1393391541,"answer_count":2,"title":"Does antibacterial soap work chemically?","body":"<p>Normal soap requires scrubbing, does anti-bacterial soap require scrubbing too?

Upon stronger suction the membrane is ruptured and the <strong>whole-cell<\/strong> patch clamp configuration is obtained. Here, access is gained to the cell, but a high-impedance seal is maintained between pipette and cell membrane. Lastly, there is a configuration where the patch is broken off the cell to exclude effects of the entire cell. This patch configuration is often used to obtain single-channel recordings. Dependent on the exact technique an <strong>inside-out<\/strong> or <strong>outside-out<\/strong> patch configuration is reached (see the picture above).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, the glass pipette is basically only there to obtain a proper seal (cell-attached), to gain access to the cell (whole-cell), or to break off a piece of membrane. Notably, in whole-cell mode the pipette provides a means to <strong>administer compounds<\/strong> into the cell (think ions or drugs).   <\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>recording electrode<\/strong> is situated inside the pipette and is a simple metal wire (platinum or platinum/iridium) and nothing different from any microelectrode as you rightfully state in your question. The electrode wire simply picks up a voltage difference (or current flow) between the interior of the cell (in whole-cell mode) and the exterior. The exterior is measured using a reference electrode outside the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, current can be injected to stimulate the cell, or to current-clamp the cell at a specific current. Likewise, voltage can be applied to voltage-clamp the cell. Therefore, an inert material is often chosen such as platinum or platinum/iridium to maintain integrity and prevent electrolytic breakdown. Electrodes are made out of <strong>metal<\/strong> to provide a low-resistance means to pick up currents or voltage-differences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Voltage differences or currents can be amplified with an amplifier, registered and analyzed.

This is governed by a complex hormonal response which is not yet completely understood, but is mostly visible in insulin levels. So it is possible that eating different ratios of macronutrients, or other factors (such as eating at different speed, or the number of meals over which you spread your food intake per day, or processing the food in different ways) will change the likelihood of gaining weight.

The proton signal is generated by magnetizing the protons in tissue, which causes their spin to change.

Water, and hence protons are everywhere in the body, including the brain and the blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>Deoxygenated hemoglobin (hemoglobin without oxygen) in blood changes the proton signal in its immediate surroundings due to the magnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin.

Thanks dude :)"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1427406263,"creation_date":1427405778,"body":"<p>Okay, so for introduction the 4 levels of protein structure (each level influences the levels after it):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>primary (1st): the order of amino acids.<\/li>\n<li>secondary (2nd): alpha-helicies and beta-sheets<\/li>\n<li>tertiary (3rd): complex 3d structure<\/li>\n<li>quaternary (4th) : 3rd+ non-protein elements (ions, co-factors etc)<br>\nand / or multple subunits interact. Not every protein has this kind<br>\nof structure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I think the first does not need any explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The secondary structure is where amino acids form 2D structures: alpha-helices or beta sheets. From wikipedia on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix\">a-helix<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet\">b-sheet<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The alpha helix (α-helix) is a common secondary structure of proteins and is a righthand-coiled or spiral conformation (helix) in which every backbone N-H group donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone C=O group of the amino acid four residues earlier (i+4 \\rightarrow i hydrogen bonding)<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The β sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is the second form of regular secondary structure in proteins. It is less common than the alpha helix. Beta sheets consist of beta strands connected laterally by at least two or three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Pictures are from <a href=\"http://www.nslc.wustl.edu/courses/bio2960/labs/02Protein_Structure/PS2011.htm\">here<\/a>, that is a great site that explains basic protein strucutre in a quite understandable way.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sS4TT.gif\" alt=\"a-helix\"> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2omiz.jpg\" alt=\"beta sheet\"><\/p>\n\n<p>These secondary structures are important because they can from motifs with specific functions like DNA binding, interaction surface with other proteins. The aforementioned wiki sites have detailed info. These secondary structures and motifs serve as building block for higher order functions. Between motifs \"loose\" non-structured parts can be found to allow for flexibility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tertiary structure:\nThis is the level where complex 3D geometric structure is defined. The aforementioned 2D structures are packed into domains - a single functional element of a protein. A single protein can have multiple domains and the relative position of these domains result in the tertiary structure. The domains themselves are connected with loose regions that do not show any high order structure and provide flexibility between the domains. Flexibility is necessary for conformational changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The quaternary structure is where non protein elements and / or multple subunits are involved. For example the positioning of the heme group in hemoglobin. Or when monomers from dimers, trimers etc. so in general when mature proteins get together to form a larger complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a great image about the different structure levels:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ER3t.gif\" alt=\"prot structure\"><\/p>\n\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://dopeahmeanbio.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/333.gif\">https://dopeahmeanbio.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/333.gif<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So now onto the \"how\" part :)<\/p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the beginning all levels influence the levels after it. So the amino acid sequence predestines the 2D structures to be formed. The secondary structures themselves are formed by amino acid forming hydrogen bonds with each other. This process occurs \"naturrally\", so by the inherent properties of the amino acids. At the third level <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bond\">disulfide bonds<\/a> stabilize the structure. This is also a naturally occuring event. Also binding ions, co-factors, etc also stabilizes the protein strucutre. <\/p>\n\n<p>The folding process can also be supported by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone\">chaperon<\/a> proteins, These proteins can actively \"twist\" the polypetide chain using ATP as energy source. They can \"sense\" if there are hidrophobic amino acid chains facing the outer surface of the protein, a thing usually avoided because these amino acids need to face inner surface of the protein where they can avoid water - this is energetically better. This signal (outward facing hidofobic AAs) indicate that either the protein is un/misfolded or it is damaged because of for example heat - that denatures (\"unwinds\") proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding\">wiki<\/a> page on protein folding if you need more.

Basically, the phenotype is a characteristic of an organism that we can eventually measure or describe (physiological, behavioural, morphological, and life history are four common classes).<\/p>\n\n<p>In a given population the phenotypic variance (the variance in height for example) can be expressed as the sum of the genetic variance (=the genetic variance underlying the phenotypic trait of interest), the environmental variance (=the environmental variance underlying the phenotypic trait of interest) and the variance due to the interactions between genes and environment (the variance due to the interaction that is underlying the phenotypic trait of interest).<\/p>\n\n<p>Mathematically expressed it gives:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$V_{phenotype} = V_{genetic}+V_{environment} + V_{gen X env}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, for each trait there is a given part of the variance that is explained by the environment and a given part that is explained by the genes. We might go a bit further and defined the concept of heritability (in the narrow sense, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia article<\/a> for more info). The heritability (in the narrow sense) is the ratio of the phenotypic variance to the additive genetic variance. Mathematically expressed it gives:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$h^2 = \\frac{V_{additive}}{V_{phenotype}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Each trait has it's given heritability. The heritability can be defined only for a trait in a population (which defines $V_{genetic}$) and its environment (which defines $V_{environment}$).<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the heritability of height in human is around 0.8. Which means that 0.8 of the variance in height in the world-wide population is explained by the genetic variance.<\/p>\n\n<p>In your question, you also used (before your question was re-edited!) the word fitness (also it is not really present in your question). The fitness is a very important concept in biology, it is the ability of an individual to survive and sire offsprings. Our phenotypic traits influence our ability to sire offsprings and therefore our genes influence our fitness. If the whole phenotypic variance is explained by the environmental variance only, then, even the the trait is under selection, there will be no change in allele frequency due to selection. Note: an allele is a gene variant. If eye color is a gene, brown eyes and blue eyes are alleles (to make it easy). This change in allele frequency is called a response $R$ to selection $S$.

To determine the detection threshold <em>psychophysical<\/em> methods can be used. A straightforward way to determine the detection threshold is with a <em>yes/no task<\/em>, where the subject receives stimuli with various intensities. An arbitrary point, mostly the 50% correct-rate, is then defined as the detection threshold. At this point, the subject correctly detects the stimulus 50% of the times. The response curve in a psychophysical task typically takes the shape of a cumulative function such as the one shown in Fig. 1. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, the detection threshold is an arbitrary point, because people are not machines and show variability in their decisions. The detection limit of, e.g., electronic devices is much more precisely defined. The exact values of the detection limits depend on the exact stimulus (visual, tactile etc.) and depend highly on the exact stimulus. For example, in the visual domain the detection limit of light depends on the color, the location in the retina tested, dark adaptation etc etc, and in the tactile domain static pressure stimuli have a different threshold than vibratory, different body parts have different thresholds etc. etc.    <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mtzGV.jpg\" alt=\"psychometric curve\"><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

This means that there\n  are continuous frequencies of oscillation....<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...Oscillators with the same biochemical identity can interact over a\n  distance by chemical diffusion and active advection of protoplasmic\n  streaming. These direct interactions will tend to synchronize phase,\n  but it may not be enough to make a strong synchrony. In fact,\n  macroscopic cellular behaviors often show fluctuating oscillatory\n  variations rather than clear oscillations with a large amplitude, and\n  the fluctuating oscillatory variations of different chemical\n  identities display frequent switching between in-phase and\n  out-of-phase relationships, although each biochemical component still\n  shows the slightly oscillatory behavior.

While they resemble lice in size and shape, booklice feed only on fungi or mold. If you find them in grain or other stored food products, it is an indication of high humidity which encourages mold growth. In addition to food products, psocids may be found under wallpaper, in furniture, along the sides of windows or on window sills around potted plants. Booklice do not bite, transmit disease, or damage food or fabric, but they can be very annoying when present in large numbers.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Biology<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/w9xt6.jpg\" alt=\"Booklice\"><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Booklice found inside homes are wingless and very tiny: less than 1/16 of an inch long. While their back legs are thicker than the other four, and resemble the legs found in jumping insects, booklice do not jump, but run about rather quickly.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Adult booklice range in color from translucent white to gray or brown. Females can produce about 60 eggs during the warm summer months and their life cycle (from egg to adult) can be completed in less than one month. When cool temperatures prevail, female booklice produce fewer eggs and the time required to complete their life cycle is over three months. Females deposit their eggs singly and often conceal them by covering with debris. Booklice undergo simple metamorphosis, that is their nymphs look just like adults except that they are much smaller and sexually immature. The common house-infesting booklice normally have four nymphal stages.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Injury<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Booklice feed on molds and will overrun cereals and similar materials that support mold growth. Their presence, therefore, is a nuisance and can render some foods unfit. The starchy paste of wallpaper and books also can support mold growth or may be attacked directly by booklice. Outside of annoyance, their damage is insignificant.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Management<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The best way to control booklice is to eliminate moist environmental conditions. Reducing the humidity in your home will eliminate the mold on which the booklice feed. Lowering the relative humidity to less than 50% will prevent their development. An air space under potted plants on windowsills will help keep the humidity down and reduce mold growth. Throw away any infested food material and make sure other foods are kept dry. Pesticides are not normally necessary to control booklice in homes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Warning<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Pesticides are poisonous. Read and follow directions and safety precautions on labels. Handle carefully and store in original labeled containers out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock.

These unique challenges require different solutions and lead to unique immune privilege mechanisms. However, although microenvironment and the stromal cells that carry out the particular function may vary between tissues, and consequently the mechanisms that promote regulation may be unique to that cell or tissue, the goal is the same: limit collateral damage to preserve tissue integrity and maintain homeostasis to the extent possible, without compromising host defense.<\/li>\n  <\/ol><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":34199,"question_id":34062,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1431502030}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34062/why-some-parts-of-the-human-body-have-immune-privilege","last_activity_date":1431502030,"creation_date":1430975626,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why some parts of the human body have immune privilege?","body":"<p>Why have the eye and CNS have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege\" rel=\"nofollow\">immune privilege<\/a>?

In multicellular organisms, individual cells (mostly) each maintain their own DNA and energy storage, though they get their nutrients and energy from outside.  They create the organism as a whole by differentiation; each cell changes to take on a specialized role and depends on other cells to support it. E.g. in animals some cells/organs digest the food and distribute nutrients to the rest, others form the lung and help distribute oxygen and others scrub the blood of waste.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This is somewhat like good code design where functions are partitioned out into specialized parts of the software for the sake of maintainability and organization. <\/p>\n\n<p>Somewhere after this point I think the analogy breaks down since after all the point of good coding practice is to organize the code for understanding within reasonable human conceptual limits.  The cells and how they organize themselves are still plenty mysterious to us as they have their own definition of roles and function much of which is still being discovered today.  For instance the many kinds of neurons in the brain and the sorts of structures they form are extremely diverse.

I was reading this paper <em>Patrono, C., et al. \"Clinical pharmacology of platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition.\" Circulation 72.6 (1985): 1177-1184.<\/em> and they seemed t mention this paragraph in the introduction.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Platelet Cycloxygenase or prostaglandin (PG) H synthase (i.e., the\n  enzyme that converts arachidonate released from membrane phospholipids\n  into PG endoperoxides) is the target of several antiplatelet agents\n  that can reversibly or irreversibly block the activity of the enzyme\n  by competing with the substrate or permanently altering the active\n  site, respectively.Such drugs belong to the class of so-called\n  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., indomethacin, aspirin),\n  but also include a uricosuric agent, i.e., sulfinpyrazone.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So we have to look for  DRC of a NSAID to say COX. Now I was unable to find a good DRC for aspirin (If you find it, let me know in the comments below. I would love to take a look at it). But I did find DRC for other drugs that inhibit COX.<\/p>\n\n<p>It led me to this paper <em>Walker, M., et al. \"A three-step kinetic mechanism for selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 by diarylheterocyclic inhibitors.\" Biochem. J 357 (2001): 709-718.<\/em> which described the inhibiton of COX2 by a NSAID called celecoxib.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The inhibition of COX isoenzymes by NSAIDs generally conforms to one of three inhibitory mechanisms: simple reversible inhibition, as demonstrated by ibuprofen ; time-dependent reversible inhibition, which includes both weaker binding inhibitors, such as naproxen , and tight binding inhibitors, such as indomethacin and meclofenamic acid ; and irreversible covalent inhibition, as demonstrated by aspirin  and o-(acetoxy-phenyl)hept-2-ynyl sulphide ('APHS') . Most of the traditional NSAIDs display similar inhibitory mechanisms against both COX-1 and COX-2 , and are relatively non-selective. However, COX-2-selective diarylheterocyclic inhibitors demonstrate distinct inhibitory mechanisms for the two isoforms . <strong>For example, celecoxib  has been reported to be a reversible competitive inhibitor of COX-1 while demonstrating time-dependent irreversible inhibition of COX-2.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering the highlighted statement, I think you can consider the COX1 curve as a standard competitive inhibition and COX2 as non competitive inhibition. The resulting change is essentially the curve shape itself (being shifted to the right). <\/p>\n\n<p>The DRCs were reported here: <em>Tacconelli, Stefania, et al. \"The biochemical selectivity of novel COX-2 inhibitors in whole blood assays of COX-isozyme activity.\" Current Medical Research and Opinion® 18.8 (2002): 503-511.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5DkIT.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly the second paper (By Walker) also described how (the authors proposed) the binding occurs.

Such inhibitors are referred to as <strong>mixed-type inhibitors<\/strong>. In many cases the unusual behavior is observed with (1) enzymes utilizing <strong>an exosite<\/strong> for substrate binding, or (2) <strong>isomechanism enzymes<\/strong>, (3) enzymes with <strong>multiple substrates/products<\/strong> and\u2044or (4) <strong>products and two-step binding inhibitors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) <strong>Enzymes with an exosite<\/strong> have a substrate recognition site that is different from the active site. For example, some proteases bind their target on the exosite and then catalyze proteolysis in the active site. Mixed-type inhibitors then bind to the exosite, thereby inducing non-competitive behavior, as the active site is not bound.<\/p>\n\n<p>(2) <strong>isomechanism enzymes<\/strong> are enzymes that undergo several structural transitional changes during catalysis. When one of these conformations is rate limiting and binds the mixed-type inhibitor, it may non-competitively inhibit the enzyme when another conformational form binds the substrate. <\/p>\n\n<p>(3) <strong>Enzymes with multiple substrates or products<\/strong> sometimes follow a sequential binding and release of two substrates (or products). Suppose substrate A and cofactor B (e.g. NADPH). The enzyme converts substrate A into A' and cofactor B to B'. Now suppose that the enzyme obligatory has to release A' before B' can be released and that the B' bound state is unable to bind substrate A in the active site, but is able to bind the mixed-type inhibitor. In this case, again, a non-competitive inhibition pattern is observed.<\/p>\n\n<p>(4) <strong>Two-step binding inhibitors<\/strong> refer to inhibitors that cause a conformational change of the enzyme after binding its inhibitor, that very slowly reverts back. In the conformationally changed state, the enzyme cannot bind the substrate and competition with substrate is lost. The most extreme case are inhibitors that covalently bind to the active site (note this is the mechanism addressed by @RoverEye).   <\/p>\n\n<p>You ask what the dose-response graphs are of mixed-type inhibitors. A more common way of displaying inhibitor behavior is using Lineweaver-Burk plots. Many enzymes follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg et al., 2002<\/a>) and by plotting the enzyme kinetics as Lineweaver-Burk plots more insight is gained into the affinity (<em>K<sub>m<\/sub><\/em>, you call this 'potency') and maximum rate of the enzyme (<em>V<sub>max<\/sub><\/em>, you call this 'efficacy') compared to dose-response graphs. In Lineweaver-Burk plots the <em>reciprocal velocity<\/em> of the enzyme is plotted against the <em>reciprocal of the substrate concentration<\/em>, resulting in a straight line out of which affinity an maximum velocity can be easily obtained via linear regression.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following graphs obtained from <a href=\"http://csrri.iit.edu/~howard/biochem/lectures/enzymeinhibition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illinois Institute of Technology<\/a> show the three different modes of inhibition discussed, starting with the two common types:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gW5T4.jpg\" alt=\"Competitive\"><br>\n<sup>Competitive inhibitors increase <em>K<sub>m<sub><\/em> (i.e., decrease substrate affinity)<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cnOVg.jpg\" alt=\"Non-competitive\"><br>\n<sup>Non-competitive inhibitors decrease <em>Vmax<\/sub><\/em> (i.e., decrease substrate turnover)<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PQdDz.jpg\" alt=\"Mixed-type\"><br>\n<sup>Mixed-type inhibitors increase <em>Km<\/em> and decrease <em>Vmax<\/sub><\/sup><\/em>\n<br><br><br> \n<strong>References<\/strong><br>\n- <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg et al.

Grass seeds are digestible; seeds have to digest themselves to sprout, with very little biochemical machinery.  Human civilization is founded on the ability to cultivate grass to eat.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is due to pepsin that a cellulase supplement would not help to digest grass stems and leaves.  Pepsin is the enzyme in the stomach that breaks peptide bonds and from its perspective, cellulase is just another peptide chain (pepsin is so effective, the stomach has to prevent itself from being digested while at the same time maintaining enough pepsin to digest food \u2014 because pepsin digests pepsin).  Cellulose is a tough sugar polymer (as is chitin, which forms insect and fungus exoskeletons), so after all the cellulase was digested by pepsin only bacteria from the intestine could process the remaining cellulose.  What the bacteria convert it to might make one ill.<\/p>\n\n<p>Humans <em>can<\/em> derive significant nutrition from bamboo shoots, which have less robust cellulose than in mature plants, and bamboo is a grass.

At this stage we can also say that the seed is aware of where it can find water. I do not think that they have been studies done on the awareness of the high and low (orientation). On the edge of rivers and lakes the seed can also find favorable ground above itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>The direction of the water determines an effort, which can also lead to the rotation of the seed in the right position to emit the radicle towards the water (and the earth). In this time the embryo \"eats\" the nutritional reserves contained in the seed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then precisely they decide which direction to go in. When the place and position are correct, the seed has open and the part to eat is almost eaten, then more light. The radicle grows to first, both in size and as the length.

This process is mainly stimulated by the blue light. The photoreceptor involved is called <em>Phot1<\/em> (Phototropin 1) or <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/O48963\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>JK244<\/em><\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Auxins such as IAA (indole acetic acid) are plant hormones, expressed highly in meristem, which cause shoot growth. On illumination this phototropin, through currently unknown messengers, causes inhibition of polar <strong>Auxin<\/strong> transport in the illuminated side. This causes the non-illuminated side to grow more and thus bending the plant towards light. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bjH5P.jpg\" alt=\"Phototropism\"><\/p>\n\n<p><em>The image represents an older model which proposed lateral movement of auxin.

Both phenomena interact with each other and share some common pathways. But hydrotropsim can inhibit geotropism and it is evident in conditions when root goes towards an adjacent water source.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ethylene and Auxin signaling is involved in root growth both in geotropism and hydrotropism. In geotropism the auxin is stimulated by statoliths (clustered and membrane bound grains of starch) in the amyloplasts- the organelles which store starch. The model suggests that amyloplst sediments under the influence of gravity and thereby affect auxin polar transport (the second figure co-incidentally illustrates polar auxin transport in geotropism). <\/p>\n\n<p>The exact moisture sensor is unknown but Abscissic acid (ABA), which is well known for its involvement in drought tolerance, is known to affect hydrotropism. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23263156\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIZ1/2<\/a> are some proteins uniquely involved in hyrdotropism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Both pathways are dependent on Calcium as a secondary messenger.\nTo conclude, these pathways are not as clear as those of phototropism. <\/p>\n\n<p>Reference:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.academicjournals.org/ajar/pdf/Pdf2006/Nov/Dexian%20and%20South.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.academicjournals.org/ajar/pdf/Pdf2006/Nov/Dexian%20and%20South.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138504002717\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138504002717<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/133/4/1677.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/133/4/1677.full<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":8101,"question_id":8094,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1431320189}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8094/what-chemicals-and-structures-control-the-direction-of-plant-growth-in-leaves","last_activity_date":1431320189,"creation_date":1367004934,"answer_count":2,"title":"What chemicals and structures control the *direction* of plant growth in leaves, stems and roots?","body":"<p>If you want a specific plant, let's say the snap peas I am growing that I bought at Agway.

Most of the homebrew system I've seen use the TSAL 6100 diode(<a href=\"http://www.vishay.com/docs/81009/tsal6100.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vishay.com/docs/81009/tsal6100.pdf<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>From what I've gathered from hobbyist forums it should be totally eye safe. However the math doesn't add up, my math could be wrong, read probably is, but I couldn't find any conclusive data that would disprove it. Also I cannot manage to factor in what effects lenses would have, which are a must to keep the beam from having to large a spread. Here are my calculations.<\/p>\n\n<p>First off using the inverse suqare law and a TSAL running at 1Amps (from what I've read most players run it at 1.5 Amps) at the minimum distance of 200mm we get the following result:<\/p>\n\n<p>Ee = 1.5W/sr / (0.2)^2m = 37.5W/m^2 (the 1.5 W/sr is from the TSALs datasheet at 1A)<\/p>\n\n<p>The irriadiance of 37.5 is a bit high, but it's still under the 100W/m^2 safety limit for the cornea.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same equation done at a distance of 100mm however yields an Ee of 150 W/m^2 which is above safety levels. Assuming you don't point a tagger in your face and start firing of shoots you'll be safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I'm curious about is how a lens affects the safety characteristics. Assuming a lens with a focal length of 100mm. Won't the irradiance be the same with the irradiance at a distance of 100mm from the IRLED.<\/p>\n\n<p>My math and understanding of the principals could be wrong, but I was curious if anyone could put my mind at ease. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've also made a rough calculation of the retinal hazzard. \nR(lamb) = 0.33 rad\n(angular subtense) alpha= 5mm/200mm = 0.025 rad<\/p>\n\n<p>We'll use an alphaeffective = 0.011rad and that gives us an emission limit for the radiance of 545mw/mm^2/sr<\/p>\n\n<p>and our iriadiance is Lir = 1500mw/sr * 0.33 / (5mm)^2 = 99mw/mm2/sr<\/p>\n\n<p>that's way below the limit, but if we modify that active light source to 1mm it becomes 495, which is skirting the line. <\/p>\n\n<p>(the tec doc doesn't define an active light source size, at least I couldn't find it so I used 5mm )<\/p>\n\n<p>Again the above calculations are for a source without a concentrating lens. What would happen if we added a lens in the mix? Would it stay in the safe zone? How does pulsing the diode effect intensity? I'm guessing it lowers it, but if anyone could manage it, I'd like a numerical demonstration that it brings it closer to safer bounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>The above calculations are based on the folowing OSRAM paper (<a href=\"http://www.osram-os.com/Graphics/XPic2/00052113_0.pdf/Application%20Note%20Eye%20Safety.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.osram-os.com/Graphics/XPic2/00052113_0.pdf/Application%20Note%20Eye%20Safety.pdf<\/a>), which explains the principles involving <\/p>\n","question_id":34143,"tags":["biophysics","human-eye"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1431273187},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e677e1bb118c65183742b414d8574f9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":15365,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15365/user983447","reputation":131,"display_name":"user983447"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9bd7c0a93e1587d390866d374842b91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9829,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9829/luigi","reputation":2475,"display_name":"Luigi"},"score":0,"post_id":34140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431272595,"comment_id":54490,"body":"The show&#39;s Wikipedia page says it takes place in a &quot;whimsical prehistoric world&quot;, so I&#39;m not sure how historically accurate it is supposed to be..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a592159aa380c054cccb3a449a9ff27?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8105,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8105/rover-eye","reputation":2003,"display_name":"Rover Eye"},"score":0,"post_id":34140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431288706,"comment_id":54495,"body":"They live in massive rookeries."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":0,"post_id":34140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431359546,"comment_id":54526,"body":"By &quot;Pteranodon&quot; do you mean pterosaurs as a whole or specifically the genus <i>Pteranodon<\/i>?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e677e1bb118c65183742b414d8574f9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":15365,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15365/user983447","reputation":131,"display_name":"user983447"},"score":0,"post_id":34140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431415998,"comment_id":54572,"body":"I mean specifically the genus Pteranodon, because those characters from the &quot;Dinosaur train&quot; are pteranodons."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"post_id":34140,"edited":false,"creation_date":1431517667,"comment_id":54633,"body":"What book did you read?
