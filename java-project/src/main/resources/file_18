Here is an example using a slightly larger tree, which demonstrates how to make a tree with both leaf nodes and internal, non-root nodes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trickiest part is translating the parents and children list into <code>ape<\/code>'s unusual internal numbering system.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>phylo_from_el &lt;- function(el){\n  i &lt;- 0\n  for(n in el[2:length(el)]){\n    i &lt;- i+1\n    parents[i] &lt;- n \n    children[i] &lt;- i+1\n  }\n  nnode &lt;- sum(children %in% parents) + 1\n  nleaf &lt;- length(el)-nnode\n  # Translate preorder sequence into ape sequence\n  ttable &lt;- matrix(c(1:length(el), rep(0, length(el))), ncol=2)\n  ttable[unique(parents),2] &lt;- 1:nnode + nleaf\n  ttable[-unique(parents),2] &lt;- 1:nleaf\n\n  parents_t &lt;- sapply(parents, FUN = function(x)ttable[x,2])\n  children_t &lt;- sapply(children, FUN = function(x)ttable[x,2])\n\n  edge &lt;- matrix(c(parents_t, children_t), ncol = 2)\n  tr &lt;- list(edge = edge, tip.label = 1:nleaf, Nnode = nnode)\n  class(tr) &lt;- \"phylo\"\n  return(tr)\n}\nel &lt;- c(1,1,1,3,3)\n\ntr &lt;- phylo_from_el(el)\n\nplot(tr)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","answer_id":42902,"question_id":37057,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37057/construct-phylogeny-form-edgelist","last_activity_date":1454348419,"creation_date":1440195007,"answer_count":2,"title":"Construct Phylogeny form Edgelist","body":"<p>I am working on large scale biodiversity simulations and have collected a lot of data on simulated phylogenies.

When fluorescent protein is used in a relatively large, non-transparent animal, like a mouse, or theoretically a dog or a human, how is the protein generally incorporated into the tissue?  I suppose that it would bind to elastin and otherwise it could be transfected into different cells in and throughout tissue, both around the skin and deeper.  However, wouldn't it only be useful near to the skin, since ultraviolet light and visible light would penetrate a limited distance through tissue?  Then again, a relatively bright light source could possibly produce light from deeper in tissue.  I'm not quite sure.  It's a relatively simple question, but I appreciate it.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Edit): I may have been a little vague with the question, a more specific version of the question I asked would be; given the brightness of a fluorescent light source that is directed at fluorescent protein filled tissue (with UV assumed to be close to the visible spectrum) and the portion of that light which is converted to visible light, approximately how could you calculate the relative brightness of the protein at a certain depth in the tissue.  Of course it probably is very difficult to get accuracy with that because that would depend on the portion of fat, muscle, collagen, etc in the tissue.  But if there's something rough and general, like the depth of the protein would reduce its relative brightness proportionally to the natural log per millimeter or something, that would be fine.<\/p>\n","question_id":42871,"tags":["biophysics"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1454303419},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bd4cfaf3fed45877ece017052da05e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":21592,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/21592/fooness","reputation":6,"display_name":"fooness"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSuGp.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19521,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19521/jordi-zambrino","reputation":1024,"display_name":"Jordi Zambrino","accept_rate":83},"score":0,"post_id":42896,"edited":false,"creation_date":1454340374,"comment_id":73919,"body":"I&#39;d recommend reading into: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19895396\" rel=\"nofollow\">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19895396<\/a> and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02066.x/asset/j.1365-3040.2009.02066.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=ik44oakh&amp;s=f526383724a7625db50bddda4912b52aa851d257\" rel=\"nofollow\">onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02066.x/&hellip;<\/a> which is about electrical and mechanical stimulation of plant movements"}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42896/how-to-stimulate-mimosa-pudica-at-its-roots","last_activity_date":1454336417,"creation_date":1454336417,"answer_count":0,"title":"How to stimulate Mimosa pudica at its roots?","body":"<p>The sensitive plant <em>Mimosa pudica<\/em> is a remarkable little plant whose characteristic feature is its ability to droop its leaves when stimulated:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ti6oX.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ti6oX.gif\" alt=\"sensitive plant animation\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>For a new studies project, could anyone think of a way to stimulate the roots of this plant, e.g. with a vibration motor or electrical stimulation, so the plant droops its leaves?<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, making the plant droop its leaves without touching the leaves directly \u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","question_id":42896,"tags":["botany","electrical-stimulation"],"score":0,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9df789d8746a3e3b7f480081186b8d86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4155,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4155/stephenchen","reputation":40,"display_name":"StephenChen"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nMw6.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16866,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16866/theforestecologist","reputation":1908,"display_name":"theforestecologist","accept_rate":14},"score":0,"post_id":10002,"edited":false,"creation_date":1456581729,"comment_id":75796,"body":"I&#39;m just wondering if you still play tennis in that location to confirm if you see any <a href=\"http://dendro.cnre.vt.edu/dendrology/syllabus/factsheet.cfm?ID=97\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Juniperous virginiana<\/i> (eastern red cedar)<\/a> nearby."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9df789d8746a3e3b7f480081186b8d86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4155,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4155/stephenchen","reputation":40,"display_name":"StephenChen"},"score":0,"post_id":10004,"edited":false,"creation_date":1377498087,"comment_id":13145,"body":"Would the tree die because of this?

The governments of Japan and the U.S. have both been very secretive at best, while an army of propagandists have made it very difficult to distinguish between truth and fiction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any health effects are likely to be too small and gradual to make headlines. For example, suppose there was a 1% increase in thyroid cancer in California due to Fukushima radiation. How could investigators prove there's a link with Fukushima radiation?<\/p>\n\n<p>Adding to the confusion is the fact that the Pacific Ocean and neighboring land masses are being battered by more than nuclear radiation. Ongoing reports of mass dieoffs of various creatures are variously linked to radiation, global warming, pollution or unknown causes. One famous example is the \"melting starfish\" disease.<\/p>\n\n<p>A lot has been written about increases in radiation in tuna. For example, see <a href=\"http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/tuna-safe-post-fukushima/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Is Tuna Safe to Eat Post Fukushima?<\/a>. Some sources say we shouldn't eat any seafood from the Pacific Ocean, period. Others say \"Don't worry.\" The propagandists particularly like to focus attention on radiation that originated from atomic bomb tests.<\/p>\n\n<p>When investigating the amount of radiation in North America, keep in mind that the levels are presumably increasing, as contaminated water is still being dumped into the sea (hundreds of tons a day, according to some sources).<\/p>\n\n<p>You can glean more specific information from the Internet, but it's just very hard to know how truthful or accurate it is.

The iodine-131 initially released from the incident decayed after 8 days, but other isotopes such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have a half-life of 28.7 and 30.2 years (about 300 years to completely decay).<\/p>\n\n<p>Apparently, large quanties of cesium-137 were found in neighbouring countries as well as in seafood near Japan. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for something like nuclear isotopes, not having the required knowledge can lead someone to fear something that might be harmless (or confirm some doubts about the issue), hence why I am here. <\/p>\n\n<p>From my research on scientific websites and different governmental regulations, I found out that food and water in Japan have a legal limit as to how much cesium-137 a food item can contain. Especially since cesium-137 ressembles potassium and therefore being easily taken up by the body, this is worrying. <\/p>\n\n<p>To my understanding, the way a radioactive isotope creates havoc in the body of an individual is that:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It ressembles a normal element we usually consume, like iodine, potassium for cesium-137 and calcium for strontium-90.<\/li>\n<li>The body digests it and it is stored in the body. <\/li>\n<li>It emits radation for a certain period of time, anywhere from 8 days for Iodine-131 to years for cesium-137.<\/li>\n<li>The prolonged radioactivity from these isotopes causes cancerous cells to occur. <\/li>\n<li>A tumour or other form of cancer develops. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>If this is what happens for isotopes like cesium-137, how can it be possible to eat food or drink water containing ANY cesium whatsoever? Sure, the radiation isn't so bad, but what is important to take into consideration is that this is internal and highly centralized radiation. This is a completely different thing to external radiation. <\/p>\n\n<p>For my questions about the topic, I would like to know three things (which could really put many doubts to rest).<\/p>\n\n<p>QUESTIONS <\/p>\n\n<p><em>The first is, is my understanding described above correct?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>The second is, how does this affect us healthwise?

However, everyone understand that people are becoming adult gradually. Sometimes, they \"age\" very quickly after some harsh experience (16 years old student who parties all days because parents pay for it vs 16 years someone whom father died and he has work to help feed his small sisters as family did depend on father's wage).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that you don't have all this information, but very incomplete \"images\" or \"screenshots\" of this kind of development. There would be quite a mess from it. You have image of one kid at 13 who is still young, another kid at 19 who is partying, single image of this 16 year old adult who has to feed his family and image of 48 year old gentleman.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you go with this mindset that most of species that ever lived you can't get and you are just guessing something from a few snapshots that are themselves incomplete as well (e.g. we often don't have whole skeleton but just single bone from a lot of species), your idea on what to expect will change. This is a first step. Then you need to realize that most of fossils that shows some transition do not form lineage, but instead branches that are related. Finally, when you understand this (and modify your expectations and \"what to look at\", you can take any relatively complete and well-studied set of fossils like human ones. On human lineage (with great apes), we can see gradual increase of brain and in the case of human, gradual decrease in size of jaw. Development of hip bone is nice as well as it shows gradual process of adaptation to upright walking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another line of examples, but again, you need to redefine your expectations, is to point on dogs.

The process is meant to amplify very quiet sounds more so than loud ones. Normally this works, and you would not notice the sound. But occasionally, the amplification level of one or more outer hair cells will go awry and as a result, the whole system will erupt into spontaneous oscillation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>When this occurs, it becomes audible to us. We perceive it as a ringing in the ear, or \u201csudden-onset ringing tinnitus <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus\">see here<\/a>\u201d. As with most of our biological systems, there are quite a few homestatic control mechanisms (negative feedback) which exist to correct the problem and get rid of the oscillation. It takes about 30 seconds for this mechanism to begin, and then sends messages which suppress the ringing. After the message is sent and received, the tinnitus percept begins to fade away.  You can tell when this reaction has taken place as its often accompanied by a slight reduction in hearing sensitivity (like background or ambient noise we hear suddenly getting quieter), followed by a feeling of fullness in the ear. It usually takes about a minute for this process to fully complete.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sources:<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation.

It's biology after all :)<\/p>\n\n<p>A <em>mitogen<\/em> is an agent that causes a cell to enter mitosis. This definition is pretty clear, and there is a good consensus about it. (Well technically, mitosis is not the same as cell division, but we will gloss over this distinction.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The term <em>growth factor<\/em> has at least two different definitions: (1) a factor that causes growth of tissues, organs or entire individuals; or (2) a factor that causes growth of <em>cells<\/em> (increase in cell size). These two versions are often mixed up, and this causes no end of confusion. Let's consider them both in turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Definition (1) is more common and probably older. Since growth of whole tissues usually (but not always) implies both cell growth and division, according to this definition, a growth factor is also a mitogen. But the reverse is not true: there are cases where cells divide without growing, for example the first few cell divisions of a fertilized egg. But note that, since this definition concerns the level of tissues or individuals, it's meaning is not entirely clear in terms of cell growth and division. Muscle growth in the adult stage usually does not involve cell division, for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>Definition (2) is better suited to cell biology (in my opinion), because it actually concerns cells, not tissues. This definition is more common when studying cell growth and division; see for example <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400805632\" rel=\"nofollow\">this review<\/a>. Cell growth is a separate phenomenon from cell division: cells can grow without dividing (fat cells, muscle fibers and neuron do this, for example), or divide without growing (as mentioned above). So with this definition, growth factor and mitogen are two completely unrelated concepts. Now, it is certainly true that many proteins can act <em>both<\/em> as growth factors and mitogens; Matej Pribis gives some nice examples in the other answer.

In the context of your question, by \"food samples\" I am assuming you are chiefly referring to meat, fish, and dairy products (the headline-making categories of food fraud), although similar principles are applied to plant products, oils, rice, and other natural products.<\/p>\n\n<h2>PCR<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are a wide variety of genetic techniques used to detect food fraud or adulteration. These techniques do not look at the entire genome of the animal or plant from which it is derived \u2013 that would be extremely expensive and unnecessary. Instead, scientists look at particular parts of the genome that they know will likely help them distinguish one species from another.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where the primers come in. DNA primers are short segments of DNA that are used to initiate replication of segment of DNA, and is the vital component of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">PCR<\/a> that determines which part of the genome will be amplified. Once the PCR product is amplified, it can be analysed by a variety of techniques. For instance, if the PCR products of various species are known, they can simply be run on gel electrophoresis which separates the DNA products by size. Thus if a band of an unexpected size appears on the gel you know there has been some contamination. There are also more automated methods of detecting fragment size via electrophoresis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Examples of where these techniques has been used has been to detect:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>cow's milk in buffalo mozzarella cheese (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958694605000099\" rel=\"nofollow\">López-Calleja et al., 2004<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>king bolete mushrooms potentially mislabelled as slippery jack mushrooms (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-001-0458-x\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moor et al., 2002<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>domestic pig meat in wild boar products (<a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/jf205109b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conyers et al., 2012<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>From the López-Calleja study on mozzarella, one of the gels looked like this: <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KpAjg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KpAjg.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The PCR was run to detect cow's milk in buffalo cheese. Lane 1 corresponds to 100% cow's milk (it is a very bright band), lane 2 is 10% cow's milk, ranging down to lane 6 which has 0.1% cow's milk (a very faint band), and lane 7 is the pure buffalo cheese which shows no band. Therefore, this assay could be useful to rule out contamination with cow's milk.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Real-time PCR<\/h2>\n\n<p>Running gels is a somewhat old-fashioned way of doing things, and there are better ways to make use of PCR technologies on a larger scale. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Real-time PCR<\/a> is the technique now routinely done to detect food fraud.

But\n  in many unicellular (e.g. the ciliate Tetrahymena or the green alga\n  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and in rare cases also in multicellular\n  organisms (e.g. in some species of Cnidaria) the mtDNA is found as\n  linearly organized DNA. Most of these linear mtDNAs possess telomerase\n  independent telomeres (i.e. the ends of the linear DNA) with different\n  modes of replication, which have made them interesting objects of\n  research, as many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtDNA are\n  known pathogens.[19]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>For human mitochondrial DNA (and probably for that of metazoans in\n  general), 100-10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per\n  cell (egg and sperm cells are exceptions). In mammals, each\n  double-stranded circular mtDNA molecule consists of 15,000-17,000[20]\n  base pairs. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their\n  nucleotide content, with a guanine-rich strand referred to as the\n  heavy strand (or H-strand) and a cytosine-rich strand referred to as\n  the light strand (or L-strand). The heavy strand encodes 28 genes, and\n  the light strand encodes 9 genes for a total of 37 genes. Of the 37\n  genes, 13 are for proteins (polypeptides), 22 are for transfer RNA\n  (tRNA) and two are for the small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA\n  (rRNA). This pattern is also seen among most metazoans, although in\n  some cases one or more of the 37 genes is absent and the mtDNA size\n  range is greater. Even greater variation in mtDNA gene content and\n  size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a\n  core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes (except for\n  the few that have no mitochondria at all). Some plant species have\n  enormous mtDNAs (as many as 2,500,000 base pairs per mtDNA molecule)\n  but, surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and\n  kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.[21]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of your sequence, it only means that it has been entered in NCBI as a linear piece of DNA (it is usually the case when you sequence only a piece of a circular DNA for example)\nIt does not mean that within the organism it is linear ! <\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question !<\/p>\n","answer_id":42814,"question_id":42811,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42811/what-does-mitochondrial-dna-bp-linear-dna-means","last_activity_date":1454121049,"creation_date":1454113053,"answer_count":1,"title":"What does \"~mitochondrial DNA ~bp linear DNA\" means?","body":"<p>I'm surfing NCBI website -<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=sus%20scrofa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nucleotide<\/a>- to find some examples of real DNA sequences to use in my small homework project. <\/p>\n\n<p>My question is related to the title of a DNA sequence below:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sus scrofa mitochondrial DNA, D-loop region, isolate: Europeanwild boar 3<\/p>\n  \n  <p>1,045 bp linear DNA<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought a mitochondrial DNA is different than a linear/nuclear DNA, especially that a mitochondrial DNA is circular while a linear/nuclear DNA is linear.

In response, the body produces these CCR9+CD4+ Th cells denoted Th17 in the lungs. Gut epithelial cells produce CCL25, a chemokine made to attract cells expressing CCR9 chemokine receptor. Th17 cells are a subset of T-helper cells that produce interleukin-17, more about that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/emi/journal/v2/n9/full/emi201358a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. So what they found, is that the Th17 cells produced by influenza infection in the lungs migrate to the gut through this CCR9/CCL25 interaction, and they secrete cytokines that are meant to defend against infection. Of course, mucosal immunity at the gut epithelium is always active, because there are commensal bacteria there that out-compete pathogens among other roles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Down in a section titled \"Lung-derived CD4+ T cells destroy microbiota homeostasis and promote resident Th17 cell polarization\" their conclusion is that IFN-gamma secreted by the lung-derived Th17 cells destroys the homeostasis of the gut microbiota, and cause other Th17 cells to become polarized in a way that they end up producing the specific set of cytokines causing the trouble in the first place. You also have to understand that the other cytokines the Th17 cells are secreting are causing tissue damage, leading to symptoms of intestinal disease concomitantly with what we've been discussing above.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that the process is just recently being illuminated so it may not be completely understood, either. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How are the lung-derived Th17 cells getting to the gut? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally, leukocytes in the lymphatics enter the blood through the left subclavian vein. Once there, they traffic to vascular endothelium expressing chemokine attractant molecules and utilize a number of adhesion molecules in concert to <em>extravasate<\/em> into the tissue expressing the attractant. This could mean multiple tissues given the right circumstances. The important thing to remember when i mentioned mucosal immunity is lots of effector cells are already there due to the presence of microbiota at all times, unlike the systemic response where effectors must be generated.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/804/flashcards/1758804/png/untitled1345993063985.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a figure about extravasation<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v8/n9/images/nrmicro2384-f4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">another about mucosal immunity<\/a>, and if you look <a href=\"http://www.biocat.com/cell-biology/t-cell-related-products\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> you can see that the Th17 lineage is under investigation due to it's inflammatory characteristics in autoimmune disease.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42779,"question_id":42762,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1454082914}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42762/why-does-influenza-sometimes-cause-gi-symptoms","last_activity_date":1454082914,"creation_date":1454007933,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does influenza sometimes cause GI symptoms?","body":"<p>I'm speaking strictly of influenza, not gastroenteritis which is sometimes mistakenly called \"stomach flu.\" I just read <a href=\"http://ruleof6ix.fieldofscience.com/2011/07/how-do-viruses-hijack-our-brains-to.html?m=1\">this article<\/a> on the mechanism through which rotavirus causes diarrhea and vomiting.

It is generally true if voltage hits a certain threshold then there will be a action potential with the same amplitude regardless the strength of the stimuli. But as you point out with the logic gate example, the threshold is notoriously hard to define mathematically. Furthermore Action Potentials don't always have the same amplitude, but as I will argue that doesn't matter all that much to the function of the neuron.<\/p>\n\n<p>As most rules in biology we can find exceptions. I'll list some phenomena that confound the all or none principle. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_accommodation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Accommodation<\/a> is the prime example that not all action potentials have the same voltage amplitude. Accommodation is the when the amplitude of the voltage of successive action potentials drops, and may even stop firing (Depolarization Block). This is usually the result of a too strong of a stimulating current, and occurs under pathological conditions. <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z9gFL.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z9gFL.png\" alt=\"A simulation of a Purkinje neuron with a lack of $Ca^{+2}$ channels causing accommodation.

The reason I bring this particular neuron  type up is it shows that thresholds are not necessarily more depolarized (positive) than rest. They are complex manifolds (or shapes) relating to the gating variables of Ion channels in the membrane.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3QiU7.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3QiU7.png\" alt=\"Hodgkin-Huxley Model under influence of a zap current.

Recall that voltage gated Calcium entry is required for a synapse to release it's neurotransmitter. Much like the logic gate, it will only enter at sufficiently depolarized (positive values) but the more positive the voltage, does not correspond to more Calcium entry.

There are viruses that are mutagens as well. Also, the number of mutations that an organism produce can also be phenotypically plastic. For example, plants have been shown to increase thee number of mutations they produced in response to stressing environment. The reason (or at least the commonly stated reason) is that they produce many mutations, \"hoping\" that at least one of the offsprings will carry a beneficial mutation and will be very fit even in this environment that is stressing for the parents. Many viruses and some bacteria also act as mutagens.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are these mutations purely random events that occur when DNA is being copied into a cell?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Mutations are random in the sense that it is impossible to predict with certitude the probability that a given mutation occurs at a given locus (position in the genome) is not necessarily the same than at another locus. In other words, they are random in the sense that it is impossible to predict the effect on the phenotype (and on the fitness) of a future mutation. There are sequences that have a particularly high mutation rate. Typically, repeated DNA sequence tend to have higher mutation rate. Also, transposons causes many mutations and regions in the vicinity of transposons have higher mutation rate.

They have to be different, since cancer cells have to accumulate mutations on a number of genes to become a cancer cell, which can survive and will not be directed into apoptosis. These are genes which control the cell cycle, certain growth factors, tumor suppressor genes, cell signalling and so on. In all these genes there need to be either activating or deactivating mutations present. Most of these mutations are point mutations (<a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP\" rel=\"nofollow\">single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNP<\/a>), where only one base is altered to achieve a mutation. An example for such a mutation would be the mutation in the B-RAF kinase, which is involved in signaling and activating genes, where a point mutation exchanges Valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E, for reference see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298448\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>). These are relatively small differences between these two cells. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Genome_Project\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancer Genome Project<\/a> aims to sequence cells from a cancer and also normal cells from the same individual and then do a comparison. Later stages tumors often tend to genetic instabilities where complete regions of the genome are duplicated, inverted or deleted, see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20177397\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for a review.\nA more basic overview is given by the Ebook \"<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/contents\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essentials of Cell Biology<\/a>\" by the Nature Group, which has an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/112301679#headerAndCitation\" rel=\"nofollow\">overview<\/a> of cancer cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the mutation rate, this is hard to estimate. There are a few papers available here, but they focus on the mutation rate in germ cells, so these are mutations that are transmitted to the next generation. The estimates there are between 70 and 100 mutations per generation per individual, depending on the research method. You can find a nicely explained blog article <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.de/2013/03/estimating-human-mutation-rate-direct.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>, which gives a number of original references, too. <\/p>\n\n<p>The mutation rate in cancer is a different thing, since this depends on which genes are mutated. The mutation rate for cancer has to be higher for the cancer cells to allow to collect the necessary transformations into a cancer cell, but these mutations seem to occur only in a few hotspot regions of the genome (Further references can be found in this article called \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24048066\" rel=\"nofollow\">The causes and consequences of genetic heterogeneity in cancer evolution<\/a>\" and in this called \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022702\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerging patterns of somatic mutations in cancer<\/a>\").

Various authorities are equating vaping with smoking by calling it a 'tobacco product' - which is in a sense true given that the majority of nicotine sold is extracted from the leaves of tobacco. I am interested in the practicality (or otherwise) of extracting nicotine from other botanical sources.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, it is not just tobacco that contains nicotine, it is common in other plants of the nightshade family, as suggested by <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199308053290619\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Nicotine Content of Common Vegetables<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Occurrence_and_biosynthesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nicotine: Occurrence and biosynthesis<\/a>. The second source notes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nicotine is a natural product of tobacco, occurring in the leaves in a range of 0.5 to 7.5% depending on variety.[84] Nicotine also naturally occurs in smaller amounts in plants from the family Solanaceae (such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplant).[85] <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Reference 85 points back to the first link, which shows this table.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoHfY.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoHfY.png\" alt=\"Table of nicotine levels in common food plants\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>But looking at the numbers, it seems unlikely. At even .5%, the 'low nicotine' tobacco leaf comes in at 5 mg/g, which is 5,000,000 ng/g - around 50,000 times more concentrated than eggplant. In fact, here is a graph of the log<sub>10<\/sub> value (2 is <strong><em>ten times larger<\/em><\/strong> than 1) of each.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QvhsP.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QvhsP.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the ability of a plant to produce nicotine is retained and handed down to ancestors because <em>nicotine is a pesticide<\/em> that ..discourages insects from eating the plant, and larger herbivores will also get sick if they eat too much of it. Logically, levels of nicotine would be higher in the leaves and stems of a plant than in the fruits/food that we &amp; animals are more interested in eating. That again makes sense, since most fruits are 'designed' to be put through the stomach of a larger animal as part of the process of regeneration.<\/p>\n\n<p>That logic seems to be borne out by the levels of nicotine in tomatoes, that start around 40 ng/g in green tomatoes, but end up at just over 4 ng/g in ripe tomatoes (not sure what's going on with that 'pureed tomato' level of over 50 ng!). The drop suggests to me that's the plant's way of preventing consumption while the fruits are still developing, but making them safe(r) to eat once ripe.<\/p>\n\n<p>But what about the nicotine content in the leaves of those plants? Logically they might have a higher nicotine content.

When I try to research it (and I have!)

I really have no image at all of humanity role or how it evolved during the gap prior to being capable of the coordinated hunts.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only theory I have heard of is the use of persistence hunting to basically chase prey before it died of exhaustion.

The reason that there are far fewer cases of Ebola is that it kills the human host so quickly, that an afflicted person will on average only go on to infect about two other individuals, mainly because victims 1) die quickly, 2) are only contagious after symptoms manifest themselves, and 3) requires direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids. <\/p>\n\n<p>Contrast that with Influenza which a single person can infect tens to hundreds of people and is contagious before they are displaying symptoms and spreads it with casual contact, or as stated above, with HIV, where a person can be contagious for weeks, months, or even years before they are aware that they are infected, and you see why HIV is very sustainable in the Human population. <\/p>\n\n<p>HIV also has the added weapon in its arsenal that it can lay dormant in cells for long periods of time so as to escape the detection of the host immune system, and as the disease attacks and kills immune cells, when the dormant virus activates again there are far fewer specialized cells to address the active infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing is it is the comorbidity with other diseases that often results in the death of a patient with an HIV infection.

However in this process the enzyme takes an ATP molecule and returns an AMP (not ADP) molecule. It's been my understanding that an ATP's energy is normally harnessed via removing a single phosphate group and leaving an ADP molecule. Processes like respiration and photosynthesis deal with the conversion of ATP's to ADP's and vice versa. I understand that in removing the extra phosphate group to get an AMP more energy is released, but that also means that more energy has to be used to convert the AMP's to ATP's. Does the cell convert the AMP's to ADP's, which will ultimately become ATP in respiration, or does the cell use some retrofitted respiration/metabolism to revitalize the AMP? I would expect the first option but it would take energy (most likely from an ATP) and I would expect the amount of energy released from an ATP becoming an ADP to be different from the amount of energy released from an ADP becoming an AMP (so an ATP becoming and ADP would be more or less energy than it would require to make an AMP become an ADP, leading to inefficencies). The other possibility (that I can see) is the AMP is just used as a nucleotide in DNA and RNA, but I don't think that the numbers add up there. I've looked around but I can't find an answer. So how do cells convert AMP's to ATP's? Also I was told that the ATP to ADP conversion is the general power-conversion. Is that not the case, or is this just some rare occurence when AMP's are involved in power conversions?<\/p>\n","question_id":42666,"tags":["cell-biology","respiration"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":114,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8dc45fea004102c4a6cb94e1c93c643?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19906,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19906/george-i","reputation":16,"display_name":"George I."},"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42692/human-walking-biomechanics-is-it-pushing-pulling-or-subjective","last_activity_date":1453838894,"creation_date":1453838894,"answer_count":0,"title":"Human walking biomechanics: is it pushing, pulling, or subjective?","body":"<p>The horses are divided in various species.

First, the idea that species evolve from simple to complex is actually not a prediction or inevitable consequence of evolution by natural selection.  The terms \"simple\" and \"complex\" themselves are ill-defined.  For instance, if you defined \"complex\" to be size of the genome, the most complex organism found to date is probably a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_japonica\" rel=\"nofollow\">flowering plant<\/a> from Japan.  This idea of arranging organisms from simple to complex hearkens back to a pre-Darwinian idea of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Chain of Being<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may be thinking that since multicellular life, for example, evolved from single-celled organisms, mutlticellular life is more complex than single celled life.  The fallacy is that modern single celled organisms also evolved from the same single-celled ancestor.  In no evolutionary sense is modern multicellular life <em>more evolved<\/em> than modern single celled organisms. You can, of course, defined notions of complexity to make multicellular life more complex than single celled life, but such definitions have no evolutionary significance.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can, of course, say that organisms evolved from earlier organisms.  So the second issue your question brings up is have scientists seen large evolutionary changes in a laboratory setting.  The example you bring up is whether we could observe the evolution of photosynthesis in a lab.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The short answer is no.  We would not expect traits which took millions of years to evolve to evolve in a lab in a shorter amount of time.  In the case of photosynthesis, we may not even have a good idea what selective pressures were involved early in the evolution of cyanobacteria.  Such traits do not usually evolve in their totality in one step.  Instead there are many steps along the way, each of which may be selected for in particular environments for different reasons.  Even if we had millions of years and a very large lab, we may not know of these early selective pressures to successfully recreate the evolution of a particular trait. (There's actually a bit more depth here which I am glossing over. Since the variation in the population is different, the same series of selective pressures won't necessarily yield the same outcome.  When traits evolve through convergent evolution, which is what you are suggesting, they virtually always have different genetic bases and underlying biochemistry.  But a digression into this is probably a distraction from the central point.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you may reasonably ask, if we can not directly observe the evolution of these major traits in a lab, how do we know that they evolved?  There are multiple lines of evidence:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can see smaller changes occur in shorter periods of time, so it seems likely that the same process creates larger changes in longer periods of time.<\/li>\n<li>For many large traits, we see evidence of common ancestry and the same underlying biology being used for different purposes.<\/li>\n<li>For some traits, we have the evolutionary history of that trait and can identify the sequence of events which brought that trait about (the best evidence generally comes from skeletal traits, where there's preservation).  <\/li>\n<li>More speculative evolutionary histories can still be examined through genetic techniques such as molecular clocks, which can indicate when species diverged from a common ancestor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":42589,"question_id":42581,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42581/have-scientists-ever-produce-a-new-species-in-laboratory-by-means-of-natural-sel","last_activity_date":1453802519,"creation_date":1453540344,"answer_count":1,"title":"Have scientists ever produce a new species in laboratory by means of natural selection?","body":"<p>I was wondering, if scientists ever produce a more complex species from a less complex species by means of natural selection?
