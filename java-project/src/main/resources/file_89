Tasks that were almost exclusively associated\n  with dominant arm use included activities requiring precision in\n  interjoint coordination and trajectory formation. (...) In contrast,\n  tasks that involved spatially orienting a body segment posture were\n  more often performed with the nondominant arm. These tasks included\n  posturing the hand to point toward a distant object, which is similar\n  to other functional tasks such as holding a piece of paper that is\n  being cut with scissors, or orienting the hand in space for catching a\n  baseball. Such postural orientation tasks are less dependent on\n  intersegmental dynamics, since the trajectory used to attain the\n  posture is not critical for task success.

If they die in a very cold environment (say at the top of some icy mountain range), they'll freeze and metabolic processes will slow down considerably, and so will cell death. But such hypothermia-based slowing down is a special case. Normally, if your heart stops or you are not getting oxygen to your brain (perhaps due to a stroke), your neurons will start dying pretty quickly. Within many minutes there will certainly be considerable permanent cell loss - certainly within hours. If oxygen is significantly depleted, ATP production will also significantly drop. If this happens, the various ATP-dependent processes will slow to a crawl (including the Na/K ATPase and other ion pumps and channels that are needed for maintaining and changing the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell). This in itself is bad enough as a lot of the enzymes and mechanisms that are dependent on the voltage difference will fail (and probably enough of a reason for many cells to start dying), but one of the effects of this is apparently an increase in the extracellular glutamate, which ultimately leads to (via NMDA receptors for example) an influx of calcium ions into the neurons. Too much of the calcium ions is once again toxic for a variety of the processes inside the cell and is an additional and big reason for neuronal cell death.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, as far as I know, neurons don't have a good time living without sufficient oxygen and therefore after a typical human death.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14451,"question_id":14439,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14439/will-neurons-live-after-the-death-of-a-human-if-so-how-long","last_activity_date":1397563515,"creation_date":1389561777,"answer_count":1,"title":"Will neurons live after the death of a human?

Some folks have recently gotten some pretty reasonable <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013408001141\" rel=\"nofollow\">crystals<\/a> of chloroquine interacting directly with hemazoin.

I haven't dug into this too deeply yet, but most antimalarial people seem to view the channel blocking activity as a side effect. There are a number of other studies underway right now evaluating the psychological effect of the channel blocking activity of the antimalarials. There's <a href=\"http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/20/1/77\" rel=\"nofollow\">one out of Iran<\/a> that says that the blocking activity of Mefloquine can be used to ease the symptoms of morphine withdrawal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Mefloquine fell out of favor not due to a decrease in efficacy, but was instead mostly taken out of circulation due to it's (justified) reputation for causing psychotic episodes in patients.

Because of this, recombination will typically put two or more such variants together onto a single chromosome.  Recombination allows for individual mutations of benefit to pool together and collect into a single place.  This multiplies the chance that stronger combinations of mutations will show in the gene pool.  This increases the fitness variance - the most powerful combinations are more beneficial than any single variant alone.  On the other end detrimental combinations will also make some individuals exceptionally weak.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So its not just recombination, but recombination <em>and<\/em> selection which create favorable combinations of alleles in populations.

Overall GC/AT ratios change by mutations, whose rate is constant.  The probability that given a mutation event that one base will be substituted by another one has been modeled in several ways where the probabilities of different mutations may or <a href=\"https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Transitions_vs_Transversions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">may not be the same<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Overall the GC content will tend to close to 50%.  What causes GC rich genomes to become GC rich (60-70%) are that mutations to GC base pairs have selective advantages either in <a href=\"http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001107\" rel=\"nofollow\">regions<\/a> or in the genome overall that <em>cause them to be retained<\/em>. The mutation rate may be no different (or even lower) in GC rich organism (many of them are deep underground or deep underwater.  GC rich genomes occur because AT->GC mutations convey an advantage and they stick around. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reasons that the GC content migrates away from 50% fall into two categories I will call entropic and selective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>By <em>entropic<\/em> I mean specifically that coding sequences for genes and other features such as binding sites on the DNA or other features such as centromeres, which will cause the overall ratio to vary from 1 because the sequence is constrained by the information it contains.  While <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8703087\" rel=\"nofollow\">coding regions have a ratio higher than 1<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/14499424_A_relationship_between_GC_content_and_coding-sequence_length/file/79e4150bb1dd6c5e51.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GC content tends to hover around 54%<\/a>.  Eukaryotes have GC islands and etc, but this also does not overall change the GC content <\/p>\n\n<p>So gene rich genomes and typical functional features of the genome do not really explain some of the spectacularly high GC contents found; up to the 70% range.  While the link above looks at GC bias in coding regions, its a given that any part of the genome that is merely a spacer between elements with specific functions will freely vary to GC if it is useful.  <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Selective<\/em> factors for high GC content include high pressure and temperature environments for instance, which usually strongly bias to high GC content by this mechanism.  You can imagine how this works: high GC content genomes are thermodynamically more stable and can survive the extra molecular collisions of higher energy of those environments more readily. <\/p>\n\n<p>GC rich genomes are not simple adaptations to live with.  All the genes for DNA oriented processes such as transcription, chromosome packing, DNA polymerase have to adjust a lot. As the organism adapts to hotter temperatures or higher pressures, <a href=\"http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005\" rel=\"nofollow\">each individual protein produced will have to also change to be stable and function in the new conditions<\/a>.  As such, these changes happen only over long evolutionary times.  This is probably a good part of the reason why the archaea niches have not been superseded by eubacteria in all 1+ billion years since life has been on Earth.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":16530,"question_id":16447,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1397496332}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16447/how-does-gc-content-evolve","last_activity_date":1397496332,"creation_date":1397066427,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does GC-content evolve?","body":"<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content\" rel=\"nofollow\">GC-content<\/a> refers to the frequency of base pairs that are either C or G in the genome, or in other words the number of GC base pairs divided by the addition of the number of GC base pairs plus the number of AT base pairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>$$GCcontent = \\frac{N_{GC}}{N_{AT}+N_{GC}}$$ <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>How does the GC-content evolve and why does the GC-content differ between populations/species/lineages?

It's hard to give a firm \"why,\" but we can discuss the ways that the ear and other \"holes\" differ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mucous membranes line every tract into/out of the human body.  Technically the ear is not a point of entry, as the tympanic membrane makes the external auditory canal a sort of blind pouch.  The skin lining the ear is keratinzed skin.  Most skin has keratin and is difficult to permeate.  But mucous membranes are moist, thin, usually highly vascular, and generally easier to permeate.  Disease often takes hold or gains entry at mucous membranes (respiratory infections, GI infections, etc). That is why mucus is so critical as it is protective and acts as a barrier and flushing-system.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Mucus requires some form of circulation, as it is a fluid.  Once produced, usually at least some of the fluid is reabsorbed, and the remaining material is passed along until it exits the body.  In the lungs, cilia bring it up to the throat and it is swallowed into the GI tract.  In the nose, it drains down the back of the throat and is swallowed.  In the eye, the fluid (which has mucus components to it) drains into a small tract that runs into the nasal passageway, which drains along with the other nasal mucus.  Obviously saliva, which also has mucus components, is swallowed (2 liters a day of it, actually).  In the genito-urinary tract, there is both reabsorption of some of the fluid components, but mainly flushing outwards when urinating.  The GI tract reabsorbs almost all water components and the remnants pass with stool.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mucus is produced by mucus glands.  Cerumen (ear wax) is produced by sebaceous (oil) glands and apocrine (sweat) glands, but is primarily composed of shed skin cells from the ear canal.  Sebaceous and apocrine glands are all over most of our exposed skin (except palms etc) so it stands to reason that they would be present in our ears as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cerumen exits the ear several ways: all skin on the body sheds the top layers as new skin grows from underneath, and in the ear, the skin cells also migrate with a directionality from the tympanic membrane outwards.  Head movements (like chewing) help dislodge things stuck to the walls.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>I'll put in my plug here about NOT using cotton swabs (aka Q-tips) to clear your ears.  It generally just pushes the wax deeper, except for the tiny bit you manage to get out.  I've cleaned out tons of wax-impacted ear canals from people who use Qtips on themselves or their kids!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If the ear were to use a mucous membrane system, the lower viscosity fluid would have to go somewhere.  We would be weeping mucus from our ears unless there were a drainage system into the sinus passageways.  The body conserves liquid, so we couldn't afford the constant fluid loss otherwise. The middle ear has a canal - the eustachean tube - which leads into the nasal sinus (although primarily to equalize pressure).  But the external ear does not, so it's probably a good thing that we don't have mucous membranes in our ears.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16535,"question_id":16528,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1397459757}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16528/earwax-versus-mucus","last_activity_date":1397459757,"creation_date":1397420817,"answer_count":1,"title":"Earwax versus Mucus","body":"<p>Something I have wondered for a while is why have two different primary defense mediums, ie earwax and mucus, that perform the same function?<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, mucus and earwax are both part of the primary defense of an organism against disease and foreign particles, by trapping any pathogens or dust that enters the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is; Why does the body use earwax for ears and mucus for the lining of other entrances to the body, why not have mucus in the ears or earwax everywhere else? is there an advantage to have each medium in their respective places?<\/p>\n","question_id":16528,"tags":["physiology"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":16535,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":654,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e22ae4c7de5955c6d5dea88e32069c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6316,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6316/isarandi","reputation":140,"display_name":"isarandi"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":6,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e22ae4c7de5955c6d5dea88e32069c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6316,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6316/isarandi","reputation":140,"display_name":"isarandi"},"score":2,"post_id":16504,"edited":false,"creation_date":1397313301,"comment_id":22268,"body":"Thanks.

The human genome contains about 3400 Mpb, meaning that you probably carry $1.25 \\cdot 10^{-8} * 3.4*10^9 = 42.5$ mutations that none of your parents had in their genome. Now if you consider the population size, you'll see that a fairly big amount of mutations occurs each generation in the human population. So mutations are not that rare! It might unfair to take human as an example though as human's population size is very big. Anyway, the great majority of mutations are deleterious. In consequence, you are right, probably not many beneficial mutations will occur in a given population at one given generation and especially not in the same individual (except if you think of viruses!).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, depending on how beneficial is the mutation you are considering (selection coefficient), depending on its dominance, depending on the (effective) population size, your new mutations might take quite a bit of generations before reaching fixation in the population. In this time other mutations might occur. And then, the question is very interesting. Imagine a population of asexual individuals where two beneficial mutations exist (at two different loci [=position on a chromosome]). Because there is no recombination (by definition of what is an asexual population) never these two mutations will be found in the same individuals and in consequence if one mutation reaches fixation, it necessarily mean that the other mutation would have disappear. In sexual population it is different. Recombination allow that the two mutations, once they reaches a sufficient frequency will probably be found in the same organism and therefore, the two mutations can reach fixation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope that helped a bit<\/p>\n","answer_id":16504,"question_id":16503,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1397321758},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e22ae4c7de5955c6d5dea88e32069c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6316,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6316/isarandi","reputation":140,"display_name":"isarandi"},"score":0,"post_id":16507,"edited":false,"creation_date":1397322895,"comment_id":22274,"body":"Thanks.

Silly system.  A codon size of 2 gives 16.  Not too shabby, but not a lot of room for growth, and not enough for those 20 amino acids.  Codons of size 3 gives 64 - plenty of room to work with and it covers all your forseeable amino acids, and then some, without being too wasteful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The redundancy, known as <strong>degeneracy<\/strong>, is pretty straightforward.  There's room to expand, and any redundancy/degeneracy will only reduce the likelihood of errors.  That's a huge benefit.  For some amino acids, the first two bases are enough.  That third position can be quite tolerant to mutation, which is very beneficial to organisms.  It appears to be even more fine-tuned, to the degree that redundancy often not only reduces the likelihood of mutation but also reduces the damage caused when a base does mutate.  Swapping a hydrophobic AA for another hydrophobic one is less likely to cause aberrant protein function, and anything with a <strong>U<\/strong> in the middle is probably hydrophobic.  Convenient!  I'll also note that, while it's not perfect or even a significant correlation, the more popular amino acids tend to get more redundancy; tryptophan is traditionally the least common AA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are a few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-proteinogenic_amino_acids\">non-proteinogenic amino acids<\/a>, so, as the linked question/answer above points out, maybe in the future there will be more amino acids.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10014,"question_id":10009,"up_vote_count":8},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea24c17719a975fb38c107a60f4b3802?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6319,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6319/vincent-fourmond","reputation":131,"display_name":"Vincent Fourmond"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1397335004,"creation_date":1397335004,"body":"<p>Some elements of response to your question.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, something about tRNA frequency. Even if there are six codons for a given amino acid, they are not equivalent because some will correspond to abundant tRNA, while others correspond to very minor tRNA. This has significant influence on the traduction speed, as the traduction will dramatically slow down on minor tRNA (while the ribosome waits for the proper tRNA). This may have very important impact on the folding of proteins (see for instance this paper: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002189\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002189<\/a>). Having several codons for common amino-acids may actually be a powerful fine-tuning too for the folding of proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, as in some cases (splicing, selenocysteine insertion, what else ?), the secondary structure of the mRNA produced is extremely important, the organisms must be able to tweak the sequence of RNA to leave room for that to happen, and that can only happen if there are lots of amino acids for which there is latitude to tweak the produced mRNA sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Third, it is false that the genetic code is universal. There are some evolutions of the genetic code, see for instance the specific case of methionine in mitochondria: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0802779105\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0802779105<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16511,"question_id":10009,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10009/how-does-the-genetic-code-evolve","last_activity_date":1397335004,"creation_date":1377505638,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does the genetic code evolve?","body":"<p>After looking at <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9990/why-is-aug-the-initiation-codon\">this question<\/a>, some other questions poped in my mind.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DNA code is redundant, there are 20 amino acids for 64 possible nucleotide combinations. Therefore some amino acid are coded by several different nucleotide combinations. While Leucine is coded by 6 codons, Tryptophan is coded only by 1 codon.

Usually it is only the last nucleic acid that does not modify the coded amino-acid (third-position wobble). <\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I would expect that the genetic code cannot not entirely be explained by \"it happened to occur this way the first time (at the origin of life or in the last universal common ancestor [LUCA]) and it never changed\". <\/p>\n\n<p>So, my questions are: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why some amino acids are coded by a big set of codons while others are coded only by one codon?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>And more specifically, why methionine is coded by only one codon (start codon = AUG) where all other amino-acids (except Tryptophan, Selenocysteine and Pyrrolysine) are coded for by more than one codon?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Or more broadly: Why (by which mechanisms, which selective pressure if any, ...) has the genetic code evolved the redundancies?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","question_id":10009,"tags":["evolution","molecular-genetics","transcription","translation","molecular-evolution"],"score":10,"accepted_answer_id":10014,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":745,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1377607773},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b769bb3fe925a4200b38df7961365c3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5596,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5596/brett","reputation":152,"display_name":"Brett","accept_rate":75},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1397329225,"creation_date":1397324047,"body":"<p>This kind of thing is normally calculated using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka/Ks_ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">$K_{a}/K_{s}$ ratio<\/a>, the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions.

A pfo causes a left to right shunt in the adult whilst a right to left shunt in the fetus. In the fetus this is normal. In the adult, it is left to right because the left atrium is at higher pressure than the right. Due to this some of your manifestations are the wrong way round but still correct. <\/p>\n\n<p>For example you mentioned hypertension, but presumably you meant systemic hypertension. It is more common at least in the early stages to get pulmonary hypertension. The pressures in the left atrium cause the pressures in the right atrium to increase when there is shunting. This is frequently seen when pressures in the left are increased due to factors like systemic hypertension. Coronary artery disease can also worsen the shunt and increase pressures in the right atrium and pulmonary pressures because the left ventricle can be stiffer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Despite all this the more common presentation of a clinically significant pfo is right heart failure. Volume overloaded,the right heart dilates and fails. This will cause the usual presentation of right heart failure i.e. peripheral oedema, ascites and hepatomegaly. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course increased pulmonary pressures also causes strain to the right heart and can also cause right heart failure. <\/p>\n\n<p>They then may go on to develop congestive cardiac failure and the exertional dyspnoea that comes with it. The inadequacy of the right heart can lead to excess strain to the left heart through a number of mechanisms that leads to it also failing. Dilation of the right heart can also lead to atrial fibrillation which in turn leads to stroke all being other possible presentations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cyanosis usually doesn't occur at least early in the disease as there isn't a shift from right to left (unoxygenated to oxygenated) but the other way round. <\/p>\n\n<p>The severity of the pfo will lead to the severity of the clinical manifestation and how early it is picked up. Most people have routine checks of their heart (the murmur is usually pretty loud) so it is frequently corrected before any clinical disease manifests. In patients with small pfos they may never notice unless they become hypertensive or put strain on their heart during pregnancy.

A gene or\n  combination of genes that promotes this state of affairs will, under\n  certain numerically definable conditions, spread throughout a\n  population simply because the younger animals it favors have, as a\n  group, a relatively large contribution to make to the ancestry of the\n  future population.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From Why We Get Sick :<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine that there is a gene that changes calcium metabolism so that\n  bone heals faster, but the same gene also causes slow and steady\n  calcium deposition in the arteries. Such a gene might well be selected\n  for, because many individuals will benefit from its advantages in\n  youth, while few will live long enough to experience the disadvantage\n  of arterial disease in old age. Even if the gene caused everyone to\n  die by age 100, it would still spread if it offered even minor\n  benefits in youth. This argument does not depend on the prior\n  existence of senescence. Other causes of death\u2014accidents, pneumonia,\n  and all the rest\u2014are sufficient to reduce the population at older\n  ages. Nor does the theory depend, like Haldane\u2019s, on cessation of\n  reproduction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The message I am trying to get across is that - As organisms are like vehicles which carry DNA and DNA just \"madly\" wants to replicate itself and pass itself from generation to generation, Natural Selection will favour those traits that maximise reproductive success. These may be traits that provide maximum benefit in youth but cause gradual damage and lead to senescence and death. <\/p>\n\n<p>You could also think like this - Every machine has wear and tear and must be thrown away after it is irreparable. Same is with our body, it is the most beautiful machine in the world but it is also subject to the same wear and tear.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also there is the end replication problem. See telomeres if you dont know what I am talking about.

In this case we are looking at citrate synthase which catalyses a condensation reaction in which the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is added to an oxaloacetate molecule to form citrate. This is the entry point for carbon into the TCA cycle for energy production. The condensation reaction follows an ordered pathway: oxalocatetate binds first and this results in a conformational change which increases the enzyme's affinity for acetyl-CoA by a factor of 20.<\/p>\n\n<p>Citrate synthase is highly specific for acetyl-CoA as a substrate.

Exactly which antigen they will recognize depends on the exact sequence of the antibody. This sequence is generated by chance, but it is generated by recombining an array of pre-existing sequences: This means that not every conceivable antibody sequence can be generated by the immune system. Moreover, it is also possible that no antibody at all can be generated for a given substance. So, no, it is not guaranteed that you will be able to generate antibodies for every possible substance.

However, it seems harder to find reports of species actually becoming <em>established<\/em> in a new location through this. <\/p>\n\n<p>The following articles describe examples of species transported with ocean debris:<\/p>\n\n<p>In an early study on the dispersal of plastic pellets (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515768\" rel=\"nofollow\">3<\/a>), it was suggested that pellets encrusted with the bryozoan <em>Membranipora tuberculata<\/em> was transported to New Zealand across the Tasman Sea from Australia. Barring one exception, this was the first time the species was observed in New Zealand waters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Appendix A of a later article by the same author (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>) contains 13 examples of species transported by sea (not necessarily through debris, or invasive), including the previous example. Of it, the author writes that<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Later, L. M. Stevens (1992, unpublished data) was to report that [<em>Membranipora tuberculata<\/em>]\n  was abundant on both eastern and western shores around northernmost\n  New Zealand.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, this is possibly a case of a species transported on floating debris and subsequently becoming established in a new habitat.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jose Derraik also deals with the topic in a review (<a href=\"http://www.caseinlet.org/uploads/Moore--Derraik_1_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">4<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Plastics floating at sea may acquire a fauna of various encrusting\n  organisms such as bacteria, diatoms, algae, barnacles, hydroids and\n  tunicates (Carpenter et al., 1972; Carpenter and Smith, 1972; Minchin,\n  1996; Clark, 1997). The bryozoan Membranipora tuberculata, for\n  instance, is believed to have crossed the Tasman Sea, from Australia\n  to New Zealand, encrusted on plastic pellets (Gregory, 1978). The same\n  species together with another bryozoan (Electra tenella) were found on\n  plastics washed ashore on the Florida coast, USA, and they seem to be\n  increasingtheir abundance in the region by driftingon plastic debris\n  from the Caribbean area (Winston, 1982; Winston et al., 1997). Minchin\n  (1996) also describes barnacles that crossed the North Atlantic Ocean\n  attached to plastic debris. Drift plastics can therefore increase the\n  range of certain marine organisms or introduce species into an\n  environment where they were previously absent (Winston, 1982).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, the book Marine Pollution: New Research (<a href=\"http://books.google.no/books?id=a4sIbHJ8AVsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Membranipora+tuberculata+new+zealand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5q_H5b54qA&amp;sig=rToDhugayBWrM_9l8cdOcbIZxRA&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ldhCU_fYHcikyAPq7oCwBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Membranipora%20tuberculata%20new%20zealand&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>) contains the following passage which ends with the observation that conclusive proof is difficult to obtain:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Drift plastics are known to have introduced exotic marine species to\n  several areas (Winston et al., 1997; Deraik, 2002). Winston et al.\n  (1997) reported that the non-indegenous oyster Lopha cristagalli was\n  fond on plastics wshed ashore in southern New Zealand, and that the\n  exotic bryozoan <em>Thalamoperella evelinae<\/em> was found on plastics washed\n  ashore in Florida. Barnes and Milnder (2005) fond the exotic barnacle\n  <em>Elminius modestus<\/em> on plastic debris in the Shetland Islands (Atlantic\n  Ocean). The bryozoaen <em>Membranipora tuberculate<\/em> is believed to have\n  crossed the Tasman Sea from Australia to New Zealand rafting on\n  plastic pellets (Gregory, 1978). M Tuberculate and the bryozan Electra\n  tenella seem to be increasing their abundance on the Florida coast by\n  drifting on plastic debris from the Caribbean sea (Winston, 1982\n  Winston et al, 1997).

The whole process of egg cell creation is called [Oogenesis].<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a> To quote Wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oogenesis starts with the process of developing oogonia, which occurs\n  via the transformation of primordial follicles into primary oocytes, a\n  process called oocytogenesis.[4] Oocytogenesis is complete either\n  before or shortly after birth.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To our current knowledge all primary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oocytes<\/a> are present at birth. The next stage in the maturing process is called ootidogenesis, which produces an ootid. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the primary oocyte\n  develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In\n  fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose\n  primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis.[8]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at\n  prophase I. In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes,\n  have halted at this stage of development, called the dictyate. After\n  menarche, these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do\n  so every menstrual cycle.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Meiosis I of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but\n  halts in the diplotene stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse\n  oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs\n  DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate\n  (leptotene, zygotene and pachytene) stages of meiosis<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>DNA replication is completed before Meiosis occurs. So oocytes do not replicate DNA after birth, but they do <em>repair<\/em> DNA to fix mutations that may occour after birth but before conception. If DNA repair fails, then mutations may persist.

The following citations are provided regarding the molecular basis of HD:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Huntingtin (HTT) was the first disease-associated gene to be\n  molecularly mapped to a human chromosome (Gusella et al., 1983)<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/A-polymorphic-DNA-marker-genetically-linked-to-11360\" rel=\"nofollow\">2<\/a>. Ten\n  years later, scientists identified the DNA sequence and determined the\n  precise nature of the HD-associated mutation in HTT (MacDonald et al.,\n  1993).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Gusella et al. used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to locate a RFLP marker linked to Huntington's disease on chromosome 4. From the introduction of their paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have now identified an anonymous DNA fragment from human chromosome\n  4 that detects two different RFLPs in a HindIII digest of human\n  genomic DNA. This polymorphic DNA marker shows close genetic linkage\n  to the Huntington's disease gene in two separate families, although a\n  different haplotype of the marker segregates with the Huntington's\n  disease gene in each family. We infer that the Huntington's disease\n  locus resides on human chromosome 4.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Further details given in the paper might justify the description given in the question. \"Fabolous luck\" could refer to the discovery or availability of suitable families and pedigrees for the genetic studies. The \"steady detective work\" would be the genetic mapping and fieldwork required to establish the link. The following quotes describe some of the efforts spent on the project:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The success of any genetic linkage project depends in large part on\n  the quality of family material available for study. We initially\n  invested considerable effort in identifying a useful family from the\n  National Research Roster for Huntington's Disease Patients and\n  Families at Indiana University. An American family of reasonable size\n  was selected and blood samples were obtained (...). Subsequently, a\n  substantially larger Huntington's disease family was located. This\n  pedigree stem from a unique community of interrelated Huntington's\n  disease gene carriers living along the shores of Lake Maracaibo,\n  Venezuela. (...)For the past three years an expedition has spent one\n  month annually in Venezuela collecting pedigree information, tissue\n  samples, and clinical data. (...) In Venezuela, many family members\n  were examined for three consectuvie years. Permanent lymphoblastoid cell lines were \n  again established for each individual to act as a permanent source of\n  genomic DNA. In both families each individual was examined by at least\n  one neurologist experienced and knowledgable about Huntington's\n  disease.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The Scitable page also summarizes the approach and results described in the paper. For the RFLP analysis, several DNA probes were tried, of which one, \"G8\", resulted in a HD-linked pattern:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>James F. Gusella and colleagues carried out a study to determine\n  whether they could identify a DNA probe that would show an\n  HD-associated restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) when\n  used in Southern blot analyses of chromosomal DNA digested with the\n  restriction enzyme HindIII (palindromic recognition sequence\n  5'-AAGCTT-3'). The team identified one probe out of 12 tested, called\n  G8, that showed a specific RFLP pattern associated with HD in two\n  large families with a history of the disease (Gusella et al., 1983).\n  Using the G8 probe, they next identified two HindIII sites (called H1\n  and H2) that were palindromic within this chromosomal region. DNA\n  fragments at these sites vary in length among different HD lineages.\n  Because researchers used two large pedigrees in these experiments,\n  they were able to obtain statistical support for their discovery\n  (Figure 3).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, at the time the origin of the G8 probe DNA in the human genome was not known, so human-mouse somatic cell hybrids were made to identify where the G8 probe DNA belonged. This showed that the G8 probe corresponded to chromosome 4, and indicated that the HD gene would be found there:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Researchers found that the G8 DNA probe hybridized only to Southern\n  blots using chromosomal DNA from human-mouse somatic cell hybrid lines\n  that contained human chromosome 4. Therefore, researchers determined\n  that the G8 DNA probe is located on human chromosome 4, and they\n  concluded that the HD gene is located on chromosome 4 near the region\n  corresponding to the G8 DNA probe (Figure 5; Gusella et al., 1983).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":16375,"question_id":16372,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1396801803}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16372/how-was-the-huntingtons-disease-genes-location-found","last_activity_date":1396878166,"creation_date":1396797691,"answer_count":2,"title":"How was the Huntington's disease gene's location found?","body":"<p>I read in the book \"Why we get sick.\" by Nesse and Williams that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Steady detective work and fabulous luck have enabled geneticists to\n  pinpoint the Huntington's gene on the short arm of chromosome 4.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I want to know what was the \"detective\" work and the fabulous luck - the whole story of the discovery of the location of the gene.<\/p>\n","question_id":16372,"tags":["human-biology","genetics","pathology","chromosome","history"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":16375,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":821,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1396805274},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee29c100b902da648c818e59ab370869?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6268,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6268/what","reputation":218,"display_name":"what","accept_rate":75},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":16384,"edited":false,"creation_date":1396859000,"comment_id":22092,"body":"You would only have to manipulate the relevant cells.

This can be seen probably in your friends who all probably have a completely different threshold for pain. When doctors ask patients to rate their pain it's usually to establish a baseline so after treatment we can see if there's a decrease. The different thresholds have so many factors from general health to receptors to brain activity to emotional state. You name it! Often just focussing on a pain makes it more painful. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's definitely an unpleasant sensation pain but it's our way of our body saying \"hey, you need to pay attention\". Usually the response required is rest or to identify what might be there causing the pain. For example pain means we will withdraw very quickly from a hot surface. Doesn't even require the brain as it is a reflex arc which minimises the time we spend burning that part of our body. And as it continues to hurt we use the arm less letting it recover and protecting it from infection by doing so. \nAs these hazards of being cut, burnt, bit, knocked, fractured are very common there is a survival advantage to be the individual that is alerted to these hazards and take the necessary actions. Particularly in children where pain is necessary as it makes the baby know it needs to eat (or the mother) or that something isn't a good idea (putting hands on something hot).<\/p>\n\n<p>However as you say there are times when the pain itself is more crippling than anything else and in that situation we have a problem. Childbirth, backache and in cancer or in tension headaches are just some examples. As being able to feel pain is pretty much required for a long life, the disadvantage of having pains like the above is less and doesn't outweigh the benefits. Pain is always going to be necessary.

There are too many variations and types of applications for me to break out in a comprehensive way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Example 1: enzyme production.  this sort of application is about optimizing the amount of a desirable enzyme or protein produced from a liquid culture.  Sorry if this is too close to cell growth, but its terribly important.  Small cell cultures are used in research and the genetics of the cells (usually e coli or yeast, but also often a fungus that's been found somewhere) to improve the amount of the desired protein.  The protein may be secreted, which makes it much easier to purify.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Once a good strain is found, the culture is scaled up to thousands of liters, often many kilos of pure enzyme can be produced this way.  Examples: the enzymes that break down fabric for acid washed jeans, the proteases and cutinases which are included in laundry detergent\nand insulin. <\/p>\n\n<p>Example 2: glucose isomerase.  <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260300715/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">This enzyme is used to produce high fructose corn syrup<\/a>.  The enzyme itself actually changes fructose into glucose, but by <a href=\"http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/equilibria/lechatelier.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">le Chatlier's principle<\/a>, a glucose syrup under high pressure will be converted to fructose by the enzyme.  This enzyme, produced by an industrial process like that described in example 1 is immobilized onto a resin and packed into large industrial sized columns.  I seem to remember from the talk that they were similar in size to an oil barrel.  Large amounts of glucose rich corn syrup are passed through the column; it comes out about 40% fructose. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another example (3)  along those lines might be how to use an enzyme with a product.  In an industrial manufacturing process like <a href=\"http://www.abenzymes.com/products/technical-enzymes/denim-wash-and-bio-finishing\" rel=\"nofollow\">enzyme denim treatment<\/a>, the fabric may be washed in a solution including the enzyme.  The process has to be careful to control the amount of enzyme the denim is exposed to and to optimize the conditions so that none of the fabric is ruined but comes out consistently.  The enzyme might be killed by a pH change or heating.

You can imagine that the poly-G sequence is a cap, preventing telomerase activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, without the telomere repeats other proteins are likely to recognize the chromosome end as a DNA break. Exonucleases would likely chew at the end of the chromosome until they got to the actual telomere sequence, which is bound by protective proteins (namely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16166375\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shelterin<\/a>). With the poly-G region degraded, the end of the chromosome would now have the true telomere repeats, and telomerase would be able to add even more repeats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if the poly-G region was bound by protective proteins, the telomeres naturally shorten with each replication cycle, due to the nature of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragment\" rel=\"nofollow\">5' to 3' DNA replication<\/a>. Therefore, the poly-G region would eventually be removed revealing the true telomere repeats and allowing telomerase to extend the chromosome once again.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a worst case scenario, rather than degrade the poly-G region the cell undergoes recombination between poly-G regions on multiple chromosomes, leading to either massive chromosomes or circular chromosomes. However, I'm sure these cells would die with some kind of massive mitotic failure.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16332,"question_id":15759,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15759/telomerase-in-tetrahymena","last_activity_date":1396585510,"creation_date":1394968919,"answer_count":1,"title":"Telomerase in tetrahymena","body":"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.ibiology.org/ibioseminars/genetics-gene-regulation/elizabeth-blackburn-part-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> amazing video, at 26:03 we see this image<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/g3rGI.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>We now know that the telomerase contains a sequence complementary to the telomere sequence and so is able to do what it is capable of doing in this image.<\/p>\n\n<p>My questions : What if we make a piece of dna with  five GGGGG at the 3' end ?
