For instance, I usually trim my fingernails every two week or so, but for toenails the number would be about 6 to 8 weeks. <\/p>\n\n<p>A bit of research revealed this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_%28anatomy%29\">wikipedia article<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In mammals, the length and growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails. [12]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In humans, nails grow at an average rate of 3 mm (0.12 in) a month.[13] Fingernails require three to six months to regrow completely, and toenails require 12 to 18 months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, sex, season, exercise level, diet, and hereditary factors. Nails grow faster in the summer than in any other season.[14]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation\">correlation does not imply causation<\/a>, so why should the growth rate of nails depend on the  length of the terminal phalanges? Then why do babies grow nail much faster? I wasn't satisfied by its answer, so I looked a bit more where I found <a href=\"http://www-scf.usc.edu/~uscience/nail_growth.html\">this other article<\/a>. They had two possible candidates:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>because hands are physically closer to the heart than are feet, fingers get better blood circulation and consequently better access to oxygen and nutrients.<\/p><\/li>\n  <li><p>Fingernails experience almost constant trauma through tapping, typing, bumping, and other seemingly insignificant actions. These persistent minor traumas stimulate fingernail growth. Toes, on the other hand, are not exposed to nearly as much trauma as they are usually bundled up safely inside socks and shoes. Similarly, fingernails on a person's right hand grow faster in right-handed people than on their left hand and vice-versa.<\/p><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However they don't give actual experimental results. So my question is which of the above is the real cause of this difference in the growth rate of nails; or simply why toenails grow much slower than fingernails?<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>P.S.<\/strong> The season dependence and the lefthand-righthand asymmetry were news to me; it would be really nice if the answer explains them as well.<\/p>\n","question_id":9466,"tags":["human-biology","human-anatomy"],"score":9,"down_vote_count":0,"protected_date":1439280001,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16876,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1374929980},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkhBX.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16927,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16927/nilay-ghosh","reputation":127,"display_name":"Nilay Ghosh"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUIMk.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11538,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11538/galen","reputation":157,"display_name":"Galen"},"score":0,"post_id":36542,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438447273,"comment_id":60825,"body":"This searchable image database may have the flower you are looking for. <a href=\"http://plants.usda.gov/gallery.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">plants.usda.gov/gallery.html<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":36542,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438450872,"comment_id":60827,"body":"Please indicate where this is located."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":36542,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438462533,"comment_id":60838,"body":"Great picture of what looks like a cactus; cf &quot;White Torch Cactus&quot;.

With RFR impacting so many people it makes me wonder, is this study valid?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well first of all, lets be clear: that is not a study.  Its a review article, basically a paper that summarizes a series of studies published.  The review itself isn't valid or invalid necessarily, it simply takes a series of papers (which may or may not be correct or relevant) and then summarizes them.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As for validity, that is a summary of a lot of obscure papers on mechanisms by which RF fields could interact with cells, rats or in a few cases plants.  Its hard to say if the conclusions are valid, but selecting a few papers at random, they are mostly very obscure journals and many report very specialized measurements that are far removed from demonstrating carcinogenic effects in humans.  Its difficult to draw conclusions that are relevant to human health from that, although it does seem plausible that low frequency fields could have a measureable effect on cells or even rats.  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are low-intensity radio-waves carcinogenic?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming you mean in people, that is a hard question to answer, and not the right question given a review article that does not address effects in people.

To summarize:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Working Group concluded that there is \u201climited evidence in humans\u201d for the carcinogenicity of RF-EMF, based on positive associations between glioma and acoustic neuroma and exposure to RF-EMF from wireless phones. A few members of the Working Group considered the current evidence in humans \u201cinadequate\u201d. In their opinion there was inconsistency between the two case-control studies and a lack of an exposure-response relationship in the INTERPHONE study results; no increase in rates of glioma or acoustic neuroma was seen in the Danish cohort study,4 and up to now, reported time trends in incidence rates of glioma have not shown a parallel to temporal trends in mobile phone use.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The Working Group reviewed more than 40 studies that assessed the carcinogenicity of RF-EMF in rodents, including seven 2-year cancer bioassays. Exposures included 2450 MHz RF-EMF and various RF-EMF that simulated emissions from mobile phones. None of the chronic bioassays showed an increased incidence of any tumour type in tissues or organs of animals exposed to RF-EMF for 2 years. An increased total number of malignant tumours was found in RF-EMF-exposed animals in one of the seven chronic bioassays. Increased cancer incidence in exposed animals was noted in two of 12 studies with tumour-prone animals12 and 13 and in one of 18 studies using initiation-promotion protocols.14 Four of six co-carcinogenesis studies showed increased cancer incidence after exposure to RF-EMF in combination with a known carcinogen; however, the predictive value of this type of study for human cancer is unknown. Overall, the Working Group concluded that there is \u201climited evidence\u201d in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of RF-EMF.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that cancers that people theorize to be associated with exposure to nonionizing EM fields tend to be extremely rare, meaning that studying them is very difficult.  This leads to a lot of uncertainty, because one must try to correlate very rare events with environmental effects. Therefore \"limited evidence\" does not mean \"no\", it just means that the effect is hard to measure and may or may not be significant given what we know.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36531,"question_id":36394,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36394/are-low-intensity-radio-waves-carcinogenic","last_activity_date":1438390936,"creation_date":1437837733,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are low-intensity radio-waves carcinogenic?","body":"<p>A recent review article, <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15368378.2015.1043557\">Oxidative mechanisms of biological activity of low-intensity radiofrequency radiation<\/a> reached a surprising conclusion<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>our analysis demonstrates that low-intensity RFR [Radio Frequency Radiation] is an expressive oxidative agent for living cells with a high pathogenic potential and that the oxidative stress induced by RFR exposure should be recognized as one of the primary mechanisms of the biological activity of this kind of radiation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They suggest the oxidative stress can cause cancer and non-cancer pathologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>This study has received next to no media coverage.

Paresthesia refers to a burning or prickling sensation that is usually felt in the hands, arms, legs, or feet, but\n  can also occur in other parts of the body. The sensation, which\n  happens without warning, is usually painless and described as tingling\n  or numbness, skin crawling, or itching.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Most people have experienced temporary paresthesia -- a feeling of\n  \"pins and needles\" -- at some time in their lives when they have sat\n  with legs crossed for too long, or fallen asleep with an arm crooked\n  under their head. It happens when sustained pressure is placed on a\n  nerve. The feeling quickly goes away once the pressure is relieved.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological\n  disease or traumatic nerve damage. Paresthesia can be caused by\n  disorders affecting the central nervous system, such as stroke and\n  transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes), multiple sclerosis,\n  transverse myelitis, and encephalitis. A tumor or vascular lesion\n  pressed up against the brain or spinal cord can also cause\n  paresthesia. Nerve entrapment syndromes, such as carpal tunnel\n  syndrome, can damage peripheral nerves and cause paresthesia\n  accompanied by pain. Diagnostic evaluation is based on determining the\n  underlying condition causing the paresthetic sensations. An\n  individual's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory\n  tests are essential for the diagnosis.

So I wanted to start off at Kimura's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">neutral theory of evolution<\/a> which encompasses both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural selection<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift<\/a>. I wanted to start here because although it is true, it also brings to light a fundamental trait of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotype<\/a> which has been highlighted in this paper which suggests that <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~zhanglab/clubPaper/05_04_2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutation rate in a species as a whole is not very divergent, but the same rate varies by several magnitudes when comparing genes having lower rates in highly expressed genes and higher in lowly expressed ones<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This brings to light another feature of gene mutation. A very simplistic view is that gene products are perfect for their function, that is not the case (I need to find a proper reference for this, maybe someone can help me with that?). Gene products are never the most thermodynamically stable nor the best at performing their intended function, but rather they are positively selected for once a mutation produces a product that provides increased fitness to the organism.<\/p>\n\n<p>Till now this answers two things:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mutation is the governing factor driving evolution.<\/li>\n<li>Unless a new mutation increases fitness of the organism it is considered as a neutral one.<\/li>\n<li>A species as a whole has nearly the same mutation rate.<\/li>\n<li>Depending on their contribution to survival genes have different mutation rates.<\/li>\n<li>A gene will choose to preserve function over improvement because it may result in a loss of function.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So now let us come to the part about millions of species. If you followed me till now, you understood that based on different mutations changes will arise. I would now like to bring in the theory of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium\" rel=\"nofollow\">Punctuated equilibrium<\/a> which basically states that a species once developed remains nearly the same for it's geological history. Below is an interesting image from the wiki page.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUh9G.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUh9G.png\" alt=\"Fossil records showing the appearance and disappearance of species within the hominid line\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So according to this theory once a species has appeared, until it disappears it will remain largely the same. It will disappear does not mean the entire line will die off. Rather, it means a substantial part of will die off, allowing niche populations to colonise the now empty ecosystem. Or a change in climate may now allow a certain niche species to migrate out of their ecosystem to provide competition to the already existing species in the ecosystem and then to oust them from their place (look at yourself for example), the migratory pattern exhibited by homo sapiens during the end of the last ice age led to the removal of neanderthals from their ecosystem (this is very traditional and overly simplistic but mostly correct so I will not provide the complicated parts here).<\/p>\n\n<p>This theory worked on the theory of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation\" rel=\"nofollow\">geographical speciation<\/a> which goes on to state that geographical changes may lead to population separation, which leads to the different species. This is because, in their own ecosystems they will be privy to very different environmental stresses such as climatic conditions, competition, predation, food availability and disease. So after a million years these two populations which were the same will now be very different.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I think, I have provided a suitable answer to this question, because your view evolution as something very linear. Which it hardly is. There are many factors which guide it, and this is how today you can see millions of species. Another thing to note is that of the millions and millions of species identified on earth today, multicellular organisms represents a handful of crumbs from the pie.

This downregulation of receptors takes time. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/SSRIs-(selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors)/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)<\/a> are a class of antidepressants <a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" rel=\"nofollow\">commonly prescribed to treat depression<\/a>. Their therapeuric effects may need weeks of treatment <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC446220/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Celada, 2004)<\/a>, which can be explained by their action on 5HT1A receptors in the dendritic region. By blocking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin\" rel=\"nofollow\">serotonin (5HT)<\/a> reuptake, negative feedback mechanisms cause the 5HT1A receptors to downregulate. This downregulation of the presynaptic modulatory 5HT1A receptors changes the firing pattern of the serotonergic neuron into a more fluttering mode, so that it releases more 5HT <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730700623X/pdfft?md5=f8c0c9b791272a8f57fc804aa31f2f21&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S089662730700623X-main.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Duman, 2007)<\/a>. More 5HT makes you feel better. That is how it fits into the monoaminergic hypothesis.

You can see a correlation between two things only if there is variation for these two things. It therefore, make no sense to look at a single trait that has no variance and ask \"is it genetically coded?\". The only thing that makes sense is to understand what variables explain the observed variance for the trait of interest. Here, in your question, you are interested in behavioural traits. This answer stands for behavioural traits as it stands for any other phenotypic traits.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What variables could explain variance in a given trait?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To make it easy, let's consider only two variables, genetics and environment. In reality, one should consider other variables such as epigenetic for example. The total variance in phenotype that you observe is the result of the addition of the variance of this phenotype that is due to genetics variance ($V_G$) and the variance of this phenotype that is due to environmental variance ($V_E$) and their covariance ($COV_{GE}$). In other words:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$V_P≈V_E+V_G+COV_{GE}$$ <\/p>\n\n<p>It is very common to express the phenotypic variance as being the sum of the genetic and environmental variances (and some others such as epigenetic variance). However, you are free to make this partitioning as you feel it useful for you.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Let's investigate those variables a bit further<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, $V_E$ and $V_G$ can be further decoupled into a sum of variances (and covariances). And you are free to do the decoupling exactly as you want to. For example $V_E$ could be defined as the sum of the phenotypic variance that is due to variance in temperature ($V_T$), the phenotypic variance that is due to variance in water availability ($V_W$) and the phenotypic variance that is due to variance in the culture of the parents ($V_P$) (and all the covariance). $V_E = V_T + V_W + V_P + ... $<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the genetic variance $V_G$ can be further decoupled. It is standard to decouple this variance in dominance vs additive effects (relating to the genetic architecture underlying the trait) but this won't be of great help to you. How about talking about variance in the genes affecting brain morphology $V_B$ and variance in the genes affecting hormones concentration $V_H$ and their covariance (epistasis and pleiotropy) $V_G = V_B + V_H + ...$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Common schema<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge there is no common schema in how to partition those variances for the specific study of the mechanistic of behaviour. I don't really understand what is the partitioning that you're suggesting in your post but I am hoping that this answer can help you to think further and eventually come up with a satisfying schema.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36437,"question_id":36411,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1438293525}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36411/is-there-a-schema-for-how-human-behavior-is-genetically-determined","last_activity_date":1438293525,"creation_date":1437926874,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there a schema for how human behavior is genetically determined?","body":"<p>It seem one can distinguish three different kinds of genetic determinism of common patterns of human behavior:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>behavior that is directly wired into our nervous system, e.g. face-related mirror neurons and chewing,<\/li>\n<li>behavior that is within reach of operand conditioning, i.e. that is predisposed by certain features of our bodies (and environment) and relatively easily discoverable by exploration, e.g. how to throw something,<\/li>\n<li>behavior that is passed on culturally, e.g. tool use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Does there exist something like this in the literature?<\/p>\n","question_id":36411,"tags":["human-biology","evolution","behaviour","reference-request"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":36437,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1437948436},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84955c52bccc775ed6bf796d0a6d642f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17046,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17046/abcdef","reputation":18,"display_name":"abcdef"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e8d0828732c8eb54a0335e7eab1ec9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":112,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/112/michael-kuhn","reputation":3583,"display_name":"Michael Kuhn","accept_rate":75},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84955c52bccc775ed6bf796d0a6d642f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17046,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17046/abcdef","reputation":18,"display_name":"abcdef"},"score":0,"post_id":36490,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438320689,"comment_id":60719,"body":"Thanks!

It is the job of philosophers and therefore this question is about philosophy and is off-topic here.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Few notes about the definition of life<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Most often, philosophers see a continuum from not living to living things and not a clear dichotomy (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Comment-d%C3%A9finir-vie-Hugues-Bersini/dp/2711748650\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref.<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Biologists, most often just assume that bacteria, archea and eukaryotes are living things while viruses, viroids and prions are not living things. This arbitrary dichotomy is based on the concept of metabolism. However, this dichotomy can lead to some limit cases. Typically, considering viruses as not being living things yields to intuitive issues when thinking about macroviruses such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseillevirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marseillovirus<\/a> and Lausanevirus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>There are two questions in your post<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the definition of what is dead is a total different question from the question of what is a living thing. A stone is not dead it is just not a living thing. Even then, the definition of death is of interest to philosophers, not to biologists.

Amplitudes may admittedly be variable, but basically it is the spike rate that is relevant to the neural code <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/94/24/12740.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Gerstner <em>et al<\/em>., 1997)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In contrast, graded potentials code information mainly by <em>amplitude<\/em>. A notable example of the significance of graded potentials is the function of the inner hair cells in the cochlea (the inner ear). The mechanoreceptors on the hair cells open when deflected in one direction, while they close in the other. This is important, as that property depolarizes the cell on one phase of an input sinusoid, while it hyperpolarizes the cell in the subsequent phase. Also, stronger (louder) input increases the response, while softer stimulu generate less response (Fig. 1). In the auditory nerve this graded potential is translated into spike rates (Fig. 2). Basically the hair-cell and auditory nerve system is an analogue-to-digital converter.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ccEp3.jpg\" alt=\"CM\"><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

But for most cases the accurate definition the author is using is not of much importance as all of the usual definitions totally fit in the sentence without changing the meaning of the concept they want to express. In you case however, the concept of adaptation seems to be a bit more complicated (and interesting) because it refers to a group-level adaptation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that most people does not really care about the exact definition they're using and this might yield to some confusion. It will probably be a bit hard to know exactly what the authors  (Dey et al.) of your article had in mind.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition of Group-level adaptation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I am here going to talk about how the term adaptation can be understood for a (social) group. This is important as I suspect the authors to use the term adaptation on a group phenotypic trait (emergent trait if you want).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Pareto optimality<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>To my experience, the concept of group-level adaptation is defined in relation to the concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pareto optimality<\/a> which is a concept used in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolutionary game theory<\/a>. Shortly speaking, in a system that is at Pareto optimality no individual can by any change of the trait under consideration increase its fitness without decreasing the fitness of another individual. In other words, a population that is at Pareto optimality has the greatest achievable population mean fitness. Therefore, it makes sense to consider a group to be (perfectly) adapted when it is at Pareto optimality.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Nash equilibrium<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Depending on the underlying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolutionary game<\/a>, the Pareto optimality may or may not be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nash equilibrium<\/a>. Shortly speaking, a population is at Nash equilibrium if no individual can increase its fitness by changing the trait under consideration. Therefore, group-level adaptation can only be stable if the Nash equilibrium is Pareto optimal. An example of game where the Nash equilibrium is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_game\" rel=\"nofollow\">free-market game<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In your case<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>At first sight, because asynchrony is a group level trait, it seems to me that the sentence \"Hatching asynchrony is thought to be adaptive [..]\" means that hatching asynchrony is thought to be at Pareto optimality. In other words, it means that hatching asynchrony is thought to be the state of the system where the mean fitness of the group is maximized, that is no individual can increase its fitness without decreasing the fitness of another individual by being synchronous.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20080,"question_id":20078,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1438021060},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78f38914e0d07733567672a47c53904b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8015,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8015/hav0k","reputation":1090,"display_name":"Hav0k"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1406718434,"creation_date":1406718434,"body":"<p>Your questions mean basically the same.

It is well seen in the various types of raptor, and is an adaptation to a type of food supply which may fluctuate. During seasons when food is short the later hatched young will probably starve as the earlier hatched young, being larger and stronger, deprive them of food, and so the size of the brood is reduced to a level in balance with the available food supply. In years of plenty all the young may be able to survive. In 'synchronous hatching' all the eggs hatch at more or less the same time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>fitness benefit<\/em> of hatching asynchrony on the species level is due to increased range of individual fitness among the young birds. The available resources do not need to be distributed equally among the offspring during unfavorable seasons such that fewer, but at least some of the hatchlings (the 'strongest') can survive. You see that this is the same as <em>beeing selected for<\/em> because on average the number of agents passing their genes to the next generation is higher with asynchronous hatching than with synchronous hatching.

The closest level of abstraction I find towards defining intelligence is this wiki on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal Cognition<\/a>.

It is the equivalent of a 17th century European going to Africa and concluding that having pinkish skin is a prerequisite for the development of technology. Or if I were to go to Japan and conclude that having an epicanthic fold is a prerequisite for making good sushi. <\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that the paths chosen by the evolutionary process on this planet are skewed towards sight and sound for more intelligent species does not in any way imply that those senses are <em>needed<\/em> for intelligence.

Light and sound are indeed particularly well suited for this since they travel several orders of magnitude faster than chemical diffusion.

Radar (bats) and sonar (dolphins) can be thought of as sight (or hearing) but are quite different. They both involve the emission of a wave and analysis of what is reflected back.

Beneath\n  the raised tunnel of soil particles that the ants had constructed, we\n  found the partially consumed carcass of a snake (1 cm in diameter and\n  10 cm long). Most of the snake's scales and skin had been removed.\n  <em>Cheliomyrmex andicola<\/em> workers were observed chewing on the snake and carrying away bits of flesh in their mandibles. As we dug near the\n  carcass, the ant workers responded by biting and stinging our hands.\n  The workers clung to our skin, and we noted that their stings were\n  more painful than those of other army ants from the site (e.g.,\n  <em>Eciton burchellii<\/em> and <em>Eciton hamatum<\/em>). We collected ant workers and samples of snake flesh into 70 percent ethanol. During raid 2 on 1\n  October 2003 at 1205 h, during a brief rain shower, our attention was\n  drawn by rustling sounds in the leaf litter on a slope in a partially\n  cleared area of terra firme forest adjacent to the station buildings.\n  A subterranean column of <em>C. andicola<\/em> workers erupted from the soil\n  in pursuit of a fleeing giant earthworm (possibly a species in the\n  genus Martiodrilus: Zicsi 1990). Several hundred ant workers emerged\n  from the soil and ran over the leaf litter in the direction taken by\n  the worm. Five <em>C. andicola<\/em> workers mounted the worm and were biting\n  and apparently stinging its body. After the worm crawled for a\n  distance of 3 m down slope from where it exited the soil, its body\n  contracted from over 40 cm in length to approximately 20 cm in length.\n  The worm abruptly stopped moving and became rigid on the soil surface\n  within 10 sec of exiting the soil, and was then unresponsive to human\n  touch. We assumed that the worm was either paralyzed or dead. We\n  lifted the worm to examine it, and we collected ant workers from its\n  body and from the raid column as it arrived where the worm came to\n  rest. Workers collected from both raids had no prey (other than snake\n  flesh at raid 1) in their mandibles.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, most army ants are (fortunately) not predators of large animals.

T-cells express a specialized receptor, called the TCR, which recognizes peptides bound by MHC proteins on other cells. The specificity of the TCR, what peptide/MHC combinations a T-cell can recognize, is randomly generated by targeted mutations and VDJ recombination in the TCR genes during a T-cells development. Each clonal population of T-cells (T-cells derived from the same precursor) have a unique TCR that recognizing different peptide/MHC pairs. When a T-cell's TCRs recognize a peptide/MHC combo on another cell, the T-cell is activated. <\/p>\n\n<p>Because the TCR is generated randomly, many TCRs in T-cell precursors can recognize peptides derived from normal human proteins. To prevent these precursors from becoming T-cells that can attack the body, they are regulated in several ways. Many self-peptide recognizing precursors are destroyed in development, others are converted into regulatory T-cells that instead produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that tune down immune responses. Those those that escape these regulatory processes are later inactivated by other means.<\/p>\n\n<p>What does this have to do with cancer? Well, most of a tumor's proteins are normal human proteins, and the human body does its best to suppress immune responses against normal human proteins, making it hard to generate an attack against cancer cells with T-cells that recognize normal self-peptide/MHC. Worse, overcoming this protective response could lead to an auto-immune attack on normal, healthy cells. Therefore, we want to make or use T-cells that recognize mutant-peptide/MHC combos. Such cells would not attack or be effectively suppressed in normal tissues, but could attack tumors.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, to get these ideal, tumor-targeted T-cells, we need the tumor to produce mutant proteins whose peptide fragments ARE DISTINCT from the peptide fragments of normal proteins. Some tumors have far more of these kinds of mutations than others, and not every mutation is immunogenic (not every mutation can be differentially recognized by T-cells). For example, point mutations (single amino acid changes) that activate proto-oncogenes like BRAF don't necessarily lead to the production of structurally different peptide fragments. A larger mutanome offers a greater chance of immunogenic mutations.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36384,"question_id":36041,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36041/why-does-t-cell-cancer-therapy-require-a-large-tumor-mutanome","last_activity_date":1437771706,"creation_date":1436793408,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does T-cell Cancer Therapy require a large tumor mutanome?","body":"<p>An article I read about Neuroblastoma states that the fact that Neuroblstoma has a small mutanome means that it is not viable to apply the classic T-cell immunotherapy.

That is, we don't have a solid understanding of how odor information is coded, so it is hard to imagine how to build a system that could reproduce that information.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is sometimes discussed in terms of a multi-dimensional \"odor space,\" where each odor could be described by its location along each dimension. The problem is that we don't really know what any of the dimensions are. By contrast, we know that visual space can be described by the intensity of a set of colors in a two-dimensional plane; auditory space is described by frequency and amplitude. It is clear that odors are comprised of chemicals, but we don't yet know where those chemicals fit in odor space. Understanding the odor space is a prerequisite to building a system that could transmit messages from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, to a great extent, how to engineer a smell transmission system is only partly a biological question. For instance, a CMYK printing system does a fine job at generating images that our RGB photoreceptors understand just fine. A telephone wire can transmit sound without a care about how the cochlea actually works. Transmitted pictures and transmitted sounds work because they activate our photoreceptors and auditory hair cells in the same pattern that the original images and sounds would. We can build systems to do this because we understand the nature of the information sensory systems decode, and we don't need a really deep understanding of the physiology to do that. (Of course, I think figuring out that physiology is great fun, but that's another point.) That is, to build a smell system, it's probably not really necessary to know what every one of the many olfactory receptors does. That's a detail of the way the mammalian olfactory system evolved. The important thing is to understand the nature of odor information. Then it really may be theoretically feasible to create a system to transmit odors.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2206,"question_id":2076,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUEfo.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":8421,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8421/gene-vincent-n-georgiou","reputation":1,"display_name":"Gene Vincent N Georgiou"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Uayv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8186,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8186/devashish-das","reputation":3783,"display_name":"Devashish Das","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":19847,"edited":false,"creation_date":1406019910,"comment_id":29544,"body":"Can you add some references?"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1406018450,"creation_date":1406010835,"body":"<p>A smell capsule with primary smells, concentrated non runny oils that can be heated up by a code sent to the capsule Then it will release the code, a built in fan will blow it to you from pc or phone, on a pc it could be renewed, maybe plugged in to a usb, Ive been thinking about this lately an have come to the conclusion that a smell Capsule would only need a collection of smells, if you type out banana there is a code behind the keys for the letter to appear, i think a smell program will be needed so that if some one sends you a coded image of a banana from there smell program the soon as you receive it and click on it the code will activate the same code in your program and you will smell the banana i have no idea how many primary smells there are or even if you can mix them but a collection of most common smells will do the job till the primary and mixing is masted,  I believe a pc is missing the smell capability and it will come along just as many other things have, it would be great to smell the ocean while watching ships or even while sailing one on a simulator, a heating of a oil scent will do the job fine, A thin wire sitting in each concentrated thick scented oil and all the different oils in separate compartments with there individual codes inside a complex capsule and a fan to blow out the heated one that the thin wire heated up     <\/p>\n","answer_id":19847,"question_id":2076,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1406018450}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2076/could-we-transmit-smells-electronically","last_activity_date":1437710265,"creation_date":1336025608,"answer_count":4,"title":"Could we transmit smells electronically?","body":"<p>We can encode sound and images in radio waves and send them, but presumably there's some physiological reason that we can't easily make a picture or video of a smell.

When you flex muscles, the blood flows towards the heart. Valve failure occurs when people stand (especially if they stand relatively still) for long periods of time every day over many years, dilating veins. You can see this on the surface of the legs as varicose veins. One way to treat varicose veins is with <em>elevation<\/em>. So, elevation does not harm vein valves.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lymph is made at the arterial end of capillaries and is part of the interstitial fluid of tissues. It bathes cells, and returns to the circulation via the lymphatic system (which also has one-way valves), goes through lymph nodes, and returns to the blood via connections with the subclavian veins. The treatment for too much lymph in the lower extremities (also known as edema) is to <em>elevate the legs<\/em>. So, elevation does not harm the lymphatics system.<\/p>\n\n<p>The heart was made to pump all day, every day, for many, many years. It doesn't get \"tired\" during a tiring day, and doesn't need to rest like we do. But it can get weak and pump inefficiently if injured (e.g. myocarditis, myocardial infarct), or if it pumps against high arterial pressure (hypertension).<\/p>\n\n<p>As long as you have healthy arteries to the legs, I can't see how your legs can suffer by elevation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main effect that I can think of is on baroreceptors. The increased volume of blood in your upper body will cause an increased stroke volume from the heart, sensed by baroreceptors, and may cause smooth muscle dilation of the vascular system. In the short term, that means you will experience more pronounced orthostatic hypotension on standing (you will be dizzier).

I know that 'complex' is a pretty ambiguous term to use, but I can't think of a more scientific term/definition for my meaning.

The ability to both produce your own young and impregnate others allow for more young.  Plus, it provides the opportunity for a species to choose to self fertilize if no mate is available.

I would have thought that, like many other mating strategies, there would be variance across species; with some choosing to be hermaphrodites to increase the maximum children they can produce as a species, by having twice the child bearers, and others choosing to go the sexual dimorphism route by having roles that they are best at.   I mean even Obligate parthenogenesis has evolved separately many larger specie like lizards, despite it arguably being an evolutionary dead end in the long term due to the lose of the advantages of sexual reproduction.

The same can be said for a sample of blood to which B-antibodies are added (B-type). If agglutination for <em>both<\/em> antibodies occurs in separate assays on the same sample of blood, it means the sample contains both A and B antigens (AB-type). If the sample is said to be O-type, this means neither A or B antigen would be present in these cells. It's safe to transfuse O-type blood into any recipient due to this fact. What you also want to watch out for, is attack on the recipients RBC's by antibodies in the donor's plasma. This can result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR), but it's noted in the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2265/\" rel=\"nofollow\">following text<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Red blood cell incompatibility may also occur when the patient's RBC antigens are attacked by antibodies from the donor's plasma.

In a normal result, ergo there aren't any antibodies to RBC's in the sample mixture, you wont see any agglutination. This is for considerations outside of ABO antibodies, generally. If you're adding to B-type RBC's a plasma with known antibodies to B antigen, like O-type plasma, you can probably expect an event.

I have no prior exposure to the field.<\/p>\n\n<p>In particular, I'm interested in the chemical mechanisms of enzyme modulation, ideally something similar to Lehninger's Principels of Biochemistry where specific Protein Databank ID's are given so I can load an enzyme in PyMOL and view where the inhibitors/activators bind, in conjunction with an explanation of the actual pathways involved from a molecular level. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've read Wade: Organic Chemistry, and a good part of Clayden's Organic Chemistry, before self-studying biochemistry for 6 months, to give a little background of my knowledge.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm leaning towards Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience after reading some other suggestions here, but this seems like a gigantic text, and I'm unsure how detailed the biochemistry side of things are (which is my main interest)? Could anyone share some thoughts regarding that, or recommend an alternative smaller text with a specific focus on biochemistry?<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm also concerned that a large amount of data and publications in the field of neuroscience fail replicaction (something as high as 60% I believe), so the book would need to contain only factual, widely accepted information and not cutting-edge speculative studies that haven't been replicated and widely accepted. Also, as little pharmaceutical industry influenced as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultimately my interest lies in understanding how different medications and drugs cause different mental states, their exact pathways and mechanisms, and how they form tolerance.
