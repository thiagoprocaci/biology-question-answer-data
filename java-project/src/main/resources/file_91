In its basis, sex only requires a segment of the chromosome to be heterogamous - that it will not be recombined.  In male humans this is both X and Y chromosomes, in other animals it is the female which has heterogamy.  Its not the entire chromosome either - the pseudo-autosomal regions of X and Y in humans do recombine.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Sexual reproduction allows some individuals to combine their genomes by donating some but not all chromosomes to offspring. The heterogamous regions are always donated by one parent and the same sex is not allowed to combine with others. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sexual reproduction is found in plants, single celled eukaryotes as well as animals.  The forces that drive the emergence of sex show up frequently enough and are persistent enough for sexual chromosomes to have <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v88/n2/full/6800016a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolved hundreds of times in plants<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Even in animals, where asexual reproduction is very rare there are multiple configurations of sex determining chromosomes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sex goes back to a very ancient trait in eukaryotes related to the haploid / diploid life cycle.  In fungi, who are related to the original metazoans, <a href=\"http://mmbr.asm.org/content/74/2/298.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">sex shows up when its needed<\/a>.  There the combination of haploid phases may be limited by more than one combination of specific elements.  Fungi can have many genders (mating types) - each of may only allow mating to specific types.  Others like Saccharomyces allow recombination between any two different mating types.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The earliest single celled eukaryotes related to animals show mating types.  The various sexual characteristics related to sexual reproduction, such as placentas, eggs, sperm form \nand function are all embellishments from sexual selection which vary tremendously from one form of animal to another.  The chromosomal functions which became sexual traits are ancient and predate metazoans.  They are not necessarily conserved though - they are simple enough to reproduce that they change their characteristics often in evolutionary history. <\/p>\n\n<p>I should say that all this doesn't apply to bacteria and eubacteria.  Why?  Because bacteria are much older and have their own systems of gene transfer and recombination with their own rules.  They usually have a single copy of their genome (I'd like to hear about exceptions - I think I know of maybe one) which makes quite gender different.  The do have something called 'sex' where a pili gene can be found on a plasmid which allows the bacteria to transfer DNA directly, which is like a sex determining locus.  But a bacteria may catch gender like a cold - it can not have it, it can get it, it can lose it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Bacteria are also capable of <a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/A/Avery.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">transferring a single gene or a segment of DNA by various means<\/a>, including pili, plasmids, phage, and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_6-2-2013-10-18-30\" rel=\"nofollow\">simply taking in the naked DNA<\/a> that they find laying around.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":16014,"question_id":15990,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1395581587}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15990/how-did-the-first-sexual-animal-come-to-exist","last_activity_date":1395581587,"creation_date":1395436472,"answer_count":2,"title":"How did the first sexual animal come to exist?","body":"<p>I am more or less familiar with the evolution theory based on mutations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, starting with a nonsexual being, how did the first organism that reproduces sexually come to exist. <\/p>\n","question_id":15990,"tags":["evolution"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":16014,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"too broad","is_answered":true,"view_count":686,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33a173fbc3159f90e6ecef38103850aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":584,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/584/thomasrive","reputation":563,"display_name":"thomasrive","accept_rate":29},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1395521754,"creation_date":1395521754,"body":"<p>This is by far too long for a comment, so as an answer: I spend now quite a while using Pubmed and other search tools, to find more information.

The common statement I've seen is that since the apes have 48 chromosomes and humans have 46, then there are two possibilities: either we \"lost\" a chromosome, which would be fatal, or there was fusion.  This, I believe, was an actual prediction prior to the answer of Chromosome 2 being identified.  But couldn't there have been a third possibility - that the apes gained a pair of chromosomes, perhaps thru splitting of some kind?  This seems reasonable to me due to the other claim that we didn't evolve <em>from<\/em> apes but that we share a common ancestor, and so the ape lineage could have acquired the extra chromosome after the split.  (Note I'm a total biology noob, so if this doesn't even make sense, then please tell me.)  I understand that this isn't the way it turned out, that Chr 2 looks exactly as we would expect from fusion, but prior to this discovery, couldn't the apes gaining a chromosome have been a possible reason?

The paper was fun to read."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1395434898,"creation_date":1395434898,"body":"<p>First of all lets have a look, what these guys want to accomplish: They want to use bacteria to make certain products. To do so, they want to exploit the bacterial metabolism at steps where no alternative pathways are available. One of these steps is the first step of glycolysis, when Glucose gets phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In bacteria the phosphorylation is done during the import of glucose into the cell by the \"phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system\", which uses Phosphorenolpyruvate as a phosphate source. This has the disadvantage, that there is almost no free glucose inside the cell, but mostly G6P.<\/p>\n\n<p>To overcome this problem, the group expressed alternative transporters (which transport glucose into the cell) and Glucokinase (Glk) to allow the cells to survive. This steps decoupled import and phosphorylation of the glucose and resulted in free glucose inside the cell. This free glucose can now be used by different proceses. It also allows glycolysis, since the Glk phosphorylates the glucose which then enters the glycolysis pathway. The Glk was put under different promoters to make different mutants in order to test how the different expression of Glk affects the cells viability.<\/p>\n\n<p>To bring in another enzyme which also metabolizes glucose, they used glucose dehydrogenase (Gdh) which was expressed from a plasmid with a strong, IPTG inducible promoter. They then used different concentrations of IPTG to test the effect on the production of gluconate and cell viability (I am not going into this).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmyfV.jpg\" alt=\"enter preformatted text here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The figure above is figure 5 from the paper and shows the effect of the three different IPTG concentrations used to induce the expression of the Gdh. For 10 and 25uM IPTG the yield of gluconate is getting smaller, the higher the Glk activity gets. Only the smalled activity shows a lower yield. This is complete different for the highest concentration, but here the cells get probably messed up by the high expression of the Gdh (which also consumes a lot of energy).<\/p>\n\n<p>In the paper they give no explanation or at least discuss the behaviour of the gluconate yield at the smallest Glk activity (I would like to read the reviewers comments on that). From the data I would expect a higher production. It is possible that the lower energy production (low amounts of G6P means little glycolysis) has negative side effects on the cells. It is also possible, that the Gdh is inhibited at lower Glk activities by some other substances in the cell. Gdh activity is for example inhibited by higher concentrations of nucleotidtriphosphates (ATP and so on), see <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00805a023\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. Since Glk needs ATP as a cofactor it would be possible that the ATP concentration at lower Glk activities has a negative effect on the Gdh activity (my own speculation). <\/p>\n\n<p>Or it is simply some artefact from the experiment. This has some points which can be critisized (I would like to see the reviewers comments here as well). First the error bars are pretty big, so this can also be somewhat different. In the text they mention that the data was acquired by <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>at least 2 parallel cultures in a representative experiment<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I would expect some more repetitions (at least three independent experiments), which would make the data more reliable. Then (and this point is much more important) they can not measure the activity of Glk and Gdh in the same culture due to restrictions in the detection system. Glk activity measurements use a coupled system which in the end measure the concentration change in NADH, while Gdh uses NADPH as a co-factor. Both versions can not be differentiated by measuring a spectrum, so activity measurements of Glk can only take place in untransfected cells. Since the expression changes conditions in the cell (and we don't know how), I would expect at least some discussion about it, but it is missing.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15988,"question_id":15979,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15979/activity-of-glucokinase","last_activity_date":1395434898,"creation_date":1395399321,"answer_count":1,"title":"Activity of glucokinase","body":"<p>From Solomon et al, 2013 ACC Synthetic biology and from <a href=\"http://www.ibiology.org/ibioseminars/biophysics-chemical-biology/kristala-l-j-prather-part-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> video :<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/T5jly.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Here, there are 2 competing reactions for glucose - one with glk as enzyme and other with gdh as enzyme. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the graph, y axis is gluconate yield and x axis is glk activity.

While these are all likely related in some way, there is no evidence that specifically preventing telomere shortening would stop ageing.

One interesting note is that seasonal flu is a phenomenon of temperate climates: in tropical regions flu outbreaks occur on a much less regular periodic schedule. Some possible causes mentioned by the authors (paraphrased from the article):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It takes time for virus to mutate enough to be infectious again to people who were already infected with it.<\/li>\n<li>The efficacy of the immune system may vary seasonally, say, due to changes in daylight hours/vitamin D and melatonin levels (which have been shown to affect immune system function in hamsters)<\/li>\n<li>Flu is transmitted better in more crowded conditions + in winter people are more crowded together. This is a popular explanation, but the authors claim that it has not been satisfactorily tested. It <em>has<\/em> been argued convincingly that the 1918 flu epidemic was exacerbated by the crowded condition of army barracks in WWI (see citation in paper).<\/li>\n<li>Indoor heating encourages air recirculation, which allows virus to persist in the air around you longer.<\/li>\n<li>Viruses survive/persist better in cold, dry conditions. This may allow them to spread in the atmosphere longer during the winter, and be more easily transmitted from person to person via \"bioaerosols\" (sneezes).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Ultimately, as I said before, we don't really know yet.

Rather, what you have to look at is the <em>proteins being expressed by the DNA coding for blood-associated proteins, as it is these proteins that are the determinant of blood acception or rejection<\/em>.In other words, the key question is whether or not the blood being transfused harbors antigens -- specific blood proteins associated with a given blood genotype like A &amp; B -- that are <em>foreign<\/em> to the recipient. <\/p>\n\n<p>Individuals that have type A blood express A-type antigens, but also house anti-B antibodies which specifically bind to blood with the B antigen. For a person with type A blood (AO or AA), transfusing either AB or A type blood would be dangerous. The RBC in both cases would house B antigens, which the recipient would respond to the transfusion by initiation an immune response against the blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want to touch up one more time on your connection of DNA to rejection of blood. Please be careful with this as different DNA really does not mean much in this case OR in many other biological cases. You have to be much more specific and ask what is the DNA encoding, what is is transcribing and eventually translating and how that relates to the biological process in question. For blood type, although every individual has 'different' DNA, their DNA for blood type has 3 distinct alleles to consider --iO, iA and iB. These alleles are located only within a small region of a person's overall DNA and the difference are 3 discrete categories, as opposed to every person having a different allele and expressing a different protein. If every person different over this small segment of DNA, in the DNA coding for blood type, then indeed it would be possible for each person to make unique antigens and thus for all transfusions to be rejected. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, since the differences  encompass only 3 allele types, people can only have a limited range of genotypes (aO, aa, bo, bb, ab, oo) which connect to only 4 distinct phenotypes (A, B, AB, O). So there is different in DNA, but the difference is defined and limited, so that overlap of genotypes between is possible and compatibility is quite common. So yes people differ in that DNA, but you have to ask if those differences are significant for a particular biological phenomenon.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15966,"question_id":15959,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15959/if-everybody-dna-is-different-then-how-blood-can-match-even-with-matching-blood","last_activity_date":1395354624,"creation_date":1395332923,"answer_count":3,"title":"If everybody DNA is different then how blood can match even with matching blood group?","body":"<p>We know that everybody's DNA pattern is different in the world.

During TCR gene rearrangement, TdT increases TCR diversity by inserting nucleotides at the D and J junction sites. IL-2 and IL-2R are expressed leading to autocrine proliferation of T cells.\nnow the  pre-T cell  rearranges TCR genes (gamma/delta, alpha/beta). At this stage the pre-T cells are CD3+CD4-CD8- or \"double-negative\" cells. Double-negative cells that productively rearrange gamma and delta chain gene segments develop into CD3+CD4-CD8- gamma/delta T cells that are exported to the periphery in small numbers. Successful rearrangement of a set of TCR genes suppresses further rearrangement of TCR genes on the sister chromatid , thus each cell only expresses TCR with a single specificity.\nThe majority of double-negative cells will go on to rearrange alpha and beta chain gene segments. The beta chain genes are rearranged and expressed first with a pre-T alpha chain to form the pre-TCR . Once the pre-TCR recognizes some intrathymic ligand , a signal is transmitted through CD3 which:\nhalts further beta chain gene rearrangement (allelic exclusion)enhances alpha chain gene rearrangement causes CD4 and CD8 to be expressed\nThe alpha beta T cells now become CD4+CD8+ or \"double-positive\" cells. T cells which fail to productively rearrange TCR genes die by apoptosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>At this point the T cells are in the deep cortex which contains epithelial cells expressing both class I and class II MHC molecules. T cells with alpha beta TCR which are capable of binding self-MHC on epithelial cells continue to proliferate and differentiate into CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ T cells. Nonreactive (not self-MHC restricted) T cells die by apoptosis. Thus, T cells are positively selected for self-MHC restriction in the thymus.<\/p>\n\n<p>T cells that survive positive selection traverse the junction between the cortex and medulla. Some of these T cells have low affinity TCR for self-MHC alone or combined with self-peptide while others have high affinity TCR. The medulla is rich in BM-derived dendritic cells and macrophages which express high levels of class I and class II MHC. T cells with high affinity TCR for self-MHC alone or combined with self-peptide interact with these dendritic cells and macrophages, and are eliminated by apoptosis.

This was an extremely common North American bird, estimated to 3-5 billion individuals, and maybe the most numerous bird species on the planet. It was heavily hunted during the 19th century (mainly by netting), which coupled to deforestation of nesting grounds led to a population crash. One of the main reasons for the rapid collapse was probably that the species was a colony nester and depended on large flocks for courtship/reproductive behaviour. This also meant that conservation measures failed when the critical situation was noticed (although hunting bans/restrictions was also weakly enforced). The few remaining wild individuals failed to breed and artificial breeding attempts also failed. The last individual died in 1914 at Cincinnati Zoological Garden (extinct in the wild from ~1900).

As described in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\" rel=\"nofollow\">this wikipedia page<\/a>, for Illumina reads there are two possible notation for single/paired end reads:<\/p>\n\n<p><code>@HWUSI-EAS100R:6:73:941:1973#0/1<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>If the last number is <code>/2<\/code> in some reads then the reads are paired end; otherwise they can be single end. <\/p>\n\n<p>The second notation is:<\/p>\n\n<p><code>@EAS139:136:FC706VJ:2:2104:15343:197393 1:Y:18:ATCACG<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>If the first number in the second group is <code>2<\/code> in some reads then the reads are paired end; otherwise they can be single end;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Then I checked for multiple files. If a sample has two fastq files it is likely that the reads are paired end. It is to note however that with a single file it is not possible to exclude that paired end reads can be interleaved in one single file, even if it is not common (in my opinion);<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The most general method is to cross check each single reads with the whole set of reads. If the first part of the sequence ID (in this case the field starting from <code>@<\/code> and ending before the <code>#<\/code> - in the first notation - or the whitespace - in the second notation) is unique among all the reads (for each read) it is likely that the reads are single reads, otherwise - if can be found a duplicate for each reads - the reads are paired end.\nIn this case, on *nix systems it can be achieved with the following command (thanks to the biostars answers):<\/p>\n\n<p><code>grep --no-filename @HWUSI-EAS100R:6:73:941:1973 *.fastq | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rgk 1,1 | head<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>If the result shows in the first lines a result like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>1        read1_ID<\/p>\n\n<p>1        read2_ID<\/p>\n\n<p>...<\/p>\n\n<p>It is likely it is single end.

Even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#Methodology\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic algorithms<\/a> which don't use living organisms at all have these 3 steps.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Most people don't have an issues with Variation any more.  At one time it was thought that individual variations were not important, but now most people understand that one water bug might have significant individual differences from other water bugs and its not just people who look at each other and marvel at individual traits.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The struggle for existence was difficult for people to accept at the time, but its simply that most living things don't make it.  Darwin had noticed that each spring that a typical bird pair might have 3-4 eggs in their nest but if you do the numbers it tells a story of how much of a struggle life can be even if we don't see it on a walk in the woods.  If all eggs reached maturity and reproduced, a single pair of birds would generate enough birds to cover England in about 40 years.  That's just a squeak under 3.5^40 without death from old age.<\/p>\n\n<p>The struggle for existence hints how competitive Selection is.  In their breeding lifetime, to have a static population of birds, a breeding pair produces 2 breeding offspring out of perhaps 14 eggs lain. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's a given that genes don't know that they have to do <em>anything<\/em>, but if they don't work well they will not be seen again. Their host dies from a developmental issue, falls and hurts itself doesn't display the right plumage, isn't fast enough to catch its food, is so slow that it gets eaten, its seed falls on soil it cannot germinate in, etc etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>The list is endless as to the things that can go wrong in the wild and would cause an individual to be removed from the gene pool and they don't produce offspring. All of the important qualities that genes need to have is mysteriously embedded in what we call the environment - the earth, the air, the water the behavior of other living things decide whether most genes make it or not. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you need any more evidence that intelligence has nothing to do with evolution, then look at human beings... not getting along well with other living things well now - is that smart? <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>An example of selection<\/strong>\nSince it was requested, let me expand and give a very simple example of random selection that I've always liked (Disclaimer: maybe because I made it up as far as I know!). <\/p>\n\n<p>Take a box of 100 coins.  We want all 100 coins to be heads up, but we can't individually flip any of the coins over: we can only shake the box.  Note that when we shake the box - nothing is thinking or acting consciously.  Genes do permute randomly and, for all reasonable approximations of infinity, infinitely, but they tend to stick around when something works.  This makes evolution seem unnaturally quick to respond.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Method 1: shake the box, looking every time. There are 2^100 combinations.  Getting terribly lucky we'd have to shake the box 2^97 times before we accidentally caught a box of all heads up coins.  That's random chance. <\/p>\n\n<p>Method 2: if we remove the coins that are heads up every time we shake the box, we'll be shaking the box 8 times or so.  That is similar to a strong selection case in evolution: the coins which are heads up are like traits which have an advantage so they stay around.  Its striking how efficient this can be and how many tremendous changes can happen in a short time if there is selection and advantage. <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that we have plenty of bad traits here (tails up); they show up all the time - with great frequency.  They just don't stick around because the struggle for existence is so challenging. <\/p>\n\n<p>You can further get an idea of weaker selection if you can imagine that instead of the heads always staying heads, you have a little stickiness on the tails of the coins.  80% or 60 or 52% of the time these coins stick and stay as heads.  It still will not be long before you find that the coins are mostly heads.  10 20 or 30 shakes of the box rather than 8.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do new traits come from then?<\/strong>\nSo taking all this and thinking about how new traits like eyes which had not been\nseen before, the same blind and random process applies.  It is better not to think of humans and human traits - we're the product of over a billion years of selection and evolution!   Think how primal traits at the bacterial level emerge.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Below is a picture of <a href=\"http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/06/multicolored-salt-ponds-at-san.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">salt pools in the San Francisco Bay<\/a>.  Evaporation increases the salt concentration in the pools and as they become inhospitable, <a href=\"http://halo.umbi.umd.edu/~dassarma/halophiles.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">halophilic (salt loving) bacteria<\/a> take over. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKgHK.jpg\" alt=\"salt pools\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The pools are colored because these bacteria have an ancient mechanism which allows them to harvest light to pump the salt out of their bodies and help create energy as well.  The light is harvested in one well documented case by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol\" rel=\"nofollow\">retinol<\/a> molecule which absorbs blue light.  Retinols are a variation on vitamin A and must be quite ancient.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Yet a similar molecule, retinal, is used in human eyes as the light sensor there.  A similar protein holds those light sensing molecules in both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin\" rel=\"nofollow\">human<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=27\" rel=\"nofollow\">halophile<\/a> as well. While the structure of the eye and the nervous system that processes information into the brain all came later, you can see at one point the interaction with a bacterium with light became so useful that once it evolved, it has stayed in the gene pool since the days of bacteria to be the light sensor.  Vitamin A is the product of a biosynthetic pathway that very easily makes a variety of molecules.  The light sensing genes that used them evolved once, but variations on it sense light in our eyes today. <\/p>\n","answer_id":15423,"question_id":15415,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1395078758},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c0cf46c3426ba3b0eebe6163d1aa130?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6003,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6003/dan-horvat","reputation":304,"display_name":"Dan Horvat"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2442ea911c89187262d6575d739a1ca7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5148,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5148/swbarnes2","reputation":1824,"display_name":"swbarnes2"},"score":0,"post_id":15658,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394561183,"comment_id":21080,"body":"No.  That can&#39;t possibly be right.

Does it mean that nature is intelligent ? How come matter itself create gravity, space etc., on one side, and creating beings to overcome it ? Isn't the matter altogether ? If that's the case, imagine a thought experiment, where in we all have dangerous predators which are 4D beings. So since our cognitive and visual percepts  are just designed to perceive 2 dimensions at a time, we being 3D creatures.

One can argue that we see in 3 dimensions because we use three cells which level of activation inform the brain of the color. I guess that the whole 3D space delimited by the maximum level of activation of each three receptors can be used. Therefore, it is nothing else than the number of receptor that determine the number of dimensions in which we can sense. Now it is assuming that each receptor can send signal of different strength information of the intensity of the light or smell.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to wikipedia. Mammals have about thousands of genes that code for olfactory receptors. Moreover, the question of how these receptors work is still debated<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In mammals, each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one functional odor receptor. Odor receptor nerve cells function like a key-lock system: If the airborne molecules of a certain chemical can fit into the lock, the nerve cell will respond. There are, at present, a number of competing theories regarding the mechanism of odor coding and perception. According to the shape theory, each receptor detects a feature of the odor molecule. Weak-shape theory, known as odotope theory, suggests that different receptors detect only small pieces of molecules, and these minimal inputs are combined to form a larger olfactory perception (similar to the way visual perception is built up of smaller, information-poor sensations, combined and refined to create a detailed overall perception).[citation needed] An alternative theory, the vibration theory proposed by Luca Turin, posits that odor receptors detect the frequencies of vibrations of odor molecules in the infrared range by electron tunnelling. However, the behavioral predictions of this theory have been called into question. There is no theory yet that explains olfactory perception completely.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note: the two competing theories for color sights: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opponent process<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromatic_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trichromacy<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n\n<p>I think this question would also be a good fit for <a href=\"http://cogsci.stackexchange.com\">cognitive science beta<\/a>.<\/p>\n","answer_id":14127,"question_id":14036,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1387906283}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14036/how-many-different-smells-can-a-human-recognize","last_activity_date":1395055045,"creation_date":1387271116,"answer_count":1,"title":"How many different smells can a human recognize?","body":"<p>How many different smells can a human recognize?<\/p>\n\n<p>If the space of smells is not discrete, how many dimensions it has (for example, the space of colors is three-dimensional).<\/p>\n","question_id":14036,"tags":["human-biology","olfaction"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":101,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1395055045},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e66602058fade943f5dc8750998d56d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":6058,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6058/user6058","reputation":16,"display_name":"user6058"},"closed_date":1395165582,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMlKc.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3776,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3776/satwik-pasani","reputation":2491,"display_name":"Satwik Pasani","accept_rate":68},"score":1,"post_id":15769,"edited":false,"creation_date":1395030509,"comment_id":21235,"body":"You should try to find the concentration of your stock solution which contains the same amount of cells as required and then dilute it.

There you compare the regulation of your group of interest with a \"normal\" group to find genes which are differently expressed. This is something we did: We overexpressed a transcription factor in a cell line and compared it to the untransfected cell line, which doesn't have this factor. The comparision brings up differently expressed genes. This is either done with microarrays or today more like by ChIP-sequencing (let me know, if you want to know more, I can go into the details).<\/p>\n\n<p>When you analyze such data, you first cut-off all data, which is below a certain threshold to be sure, that you reduce the number of false positives. A low threshold for the recognition of changes means that you are more likely to have false positive genes in your final list. This might happen due to changes in the cell or the conditions, secondary effects and so on. And you will also have signals, which appear statistically and which are false positive. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you choose your threshold too high, you will reduce the number of false positives, but on the downside you will also generate false negatives, since you refuse genes which only have a relatively low change but are real. The balance between this is not always easy. As a rule of thumb usually everything which changes at least twofold in expression is used (unless you control better).<\/p>\n\n<p>Even when filtered, the output of the experiment will still contain some false positives. Then you will also record some secondary effects, meaning that you gene of interest regulates a second, which regulates a third. Since both will come up in the analysis, it will look like that the third gene is regulated by the first (and not the second, as it would be correct). And these are the reasons why usually every intereaction between two genes (or better: Between a protein and a gene when talking about a transcription factor or two proteins) needs to be verified in the wet lab.

Streptomyces linear chromosomes are very\n  unstable and at high frequency undergo amplifications and large\n  deletions, often removing the telomeres. At least in Streptomyces,\n  chromosome linearity is reversible: circular chromosomes arise\n  spontaneously as products of genetic instability or can be generated\n  artificially by targeted recombination. Streptomyces circularised\n  chromosomes are very unstable as well, indicating that genetic\n  instability is not confined to the linearised chromosomes. Bacterial\n  linear chromosomes may contain telomere-linked regions of enhanced\n  genomic plasticity, which undergo more frequent genetic exchanges and\n  rearrangements and allow differential evolution of genes, depending on\n  their chromosomal location.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":3459,"question_id":3455,"up_vote_count":10},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/534e3bd6fc9d8168f4dc8420f7872440?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6054,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6054/inesophet","reputation":46,"display_name":"Inesophet"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53c30bc1f1ac4e6b256e52b62124da86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1757,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1757/androidpenguin","reputation":4652,"display_name":"AndroidPenguin","accept_rate":25},"score":1,"post_id":15752,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394967415,"comment_id":21218,"body":"An interesting theory!

It is, however, a blind innovator &mdash; the novel genotypes produced by mutation are essentially random, and no more likely to be advantageous to the organisms carrying them than one would expect by change (i.e. not very likely at all).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Selection<\/strong>, whether natural or artificial, is what happens when the organisms carrying the diverse genomes produced by mutation end up competing for survival and reproductive opportunities against each other and against their environment.  It acts on the diversity generated and replenished by mutation, favoring those mutations that happen to confer a survival advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>inheritance<\/strong> ensures that the beneficial alleles generated by mutation and filtered by selection get passed on to successive generations, allowing them to spread in the population and to be further modified by successive mutations.  In a sense, inheritance and mutation can be seen as opposite sides of the same coin: the more faithfully genes are inherited, the less mutations there are.  Yet both are necessary for evolution; an organism that never mutates obviously could not evolve, but neither could one that mutated so much that all of its genes were totally scrambled in each generation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this whole process is stochastic in nature &mdash; even the best adapted individual may die without offspring due to simple bad luck, just as even a maladapted individual may get lucky and prosper.  But over generations, there is nonetheless a statistical tendency for individuals carrying certain alleles, or combinations of them, to be more fecund than others, and those will be the alleles that will eventually come to dominate the population (assuming they're not it turn displaced by even more successful mutants).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, I would personally say that, of these three components of evolution, (natural) selection indeed \"works only with what is already present in a population.\"  However, it's not really like a copy editor, since it does not seek to \"correct errors\" in the genome; it's more akin to a <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slush_pile\" rel=\"nofollow\">slush reader<\/a>, who just sorts the incoming texts into ones to keep and ones to throw away.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15692,"question_id":15691,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15691/is-natural-selection-like-a-copy-editor","last_activity_date":1394679233,"creation_date":1394675609,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is Natural Selection like a Copy Editor?","body":"<p>I am stuck on a Homework Question.

This healing process, however, is only possible because the bones are <em>inside<\/em> the body, surrounded and permeated by living tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your nails, however, are simple sheets of <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin\" rel=\"nofollow\">keratin<\/a>, and contain no living cells that could heal them, nor any blood vessels that could keep such cells alive.  Being exposed to the outside of the body, outside the skin barrier, they cannot really support living tissue that could heal them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, the way human nails (and animal claws, more generally) \"heal\" is by growing.  Since the nail itself cannot contain cells that would rebuild it, those cells are instead located in the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">nail matrix<\/a>, which is located under the nail and from which the exposed part of the nail continually grows out of.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Indeed, the same is true of most of the exposed parts of your body: your hair and even the surface of your skin itself are also composed of non-living keratin constantly growing from an underlying matrix.  This is necessary to maintain the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_barrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">skin barrier<\/a> between the interior and the exterior of the body.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason human nails must keep growing all the time is that they do continually wear down and suffer damage from various causes (and would surely have worn down much faster yet for our primitive ancestors, who had to sustain themselves through hard manual labor with few or no tools).  If your nails just stopped growing after you reached adulthood, they'd be in <em>horrible<\/em> shape even just a few years down the road, not to mention decades later.<\/p>\n\n<p>While the rate at which human nails do grow is pretty slow &mdash; it takes several months for a damaged fingernail to fully regrow, and up to a year for a toenail (a fact I can confirm from personal experience, having broken my toenail last summer) &mdash; it's still enough to ensure that your nails will only bear less than a year's cumulative damage at any moment, rather than every nick and scratch and cut they've suffered during your entire lifetime so far.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a relatively sheltered modern lifestyle, it's quite likely that even this moderate growth rate may exceed normal wear on your nails, requiring them to be clipped regularly.  Still, the fact that you <em>can<\/em> clip your nails (or, in a pre-modern society, just bite or scrape or cut them down) reduces the selection pressure against excessive nail growth.  On the other hand, <em>not<\/em> having your nails grow back as fast as you wear them down through hard manual work could be quite bad for your fingers, and could easily reduce your working ability or even lead to harmful infections.  Thus, it makes sense that evolution has optimized out nails to grow at a rate that, on average, tends to somewhat exceed the typical rate of wear.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15672,"question_id":14216,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14216/how-would-constantly-growing-nails-have-aided-early-human","last_activity_date":1394589905,"creation_date":1388452404,"answer_count":2,"title":"How would constantly growing nails have aided early human?","body":"<p>Nails grow rapidly and constantly, such that without constant artificial trimming they would reach lengths difficult to manage.

There are also numerous other flaws in the Paleo diet but I won't go through them all.<\/p>\n\n<p>The most notable example to use here would be dairy products, as we're among the few species that can drink milk at adult age. Drinking milk as an adult isn't normal, and yet we evolved the ability to do so. Some individuals can't drink milk, same goes for consuming gluten, nuts, and several other things, but the species as a whole can consume all of the above. Some people must avoid certain foods because of their individual genetic makeup though. Most evolved to process gluten and this ability is greatly responsible for the fact that there are 7 billion of us now. If you read an article \"gluten is bad\", remember that gluten grew the human race and without it at least a third of the world's population would die through starvation. If you read an article about the Paleo diet, remember we wouldn't be here if the agricultural revolution didn't happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>The correct answer would be - humans can consume everything that isn't toxic and provides them with energy. We're very capable omnivores, which is probably one of the reasons why we've done so well as a species. In other words, you won't die from eating processed sugar. There are healthier and less healthy foods, but none will kill you.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are correct, there are numerous answers (or attempts to answer) to this question, and the way the research is concluded definitely doesn't help. Research is mostly conducted through polls designed to prove the scientist's original unverified claim, and virtually no research is conducted on the biological level, e.g. what happens to the body when you consume a certain carbohydrate. The whole field became pseudoscientific. The \"food pyramid\" is...pretty much wrong.<\/p>\n\n<p>Body needs proteins, body needs carbohydrates, body needs fat. You could come up with a vague answer if you eliminate the foods that body doesn't need, such as processed sugars, but it's still energy and you won't die from consuming it.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no scientific research that consumation of any food, or elimination of any food, affects life span. Meaning, there's no differential survival rate depending on what you eat.<\/p>\n\n<p>To put things in perspective, imagine a lion preoccupied with attempting to answer whether it would be better for his body to eat an antilope or a gazelle. 10.000 calories is 10.000 calories and if he eats either he'll live another day.<\/p>\n","answer_id":15652,"question_id":15649,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/15649/from-a-purely-biological-perspective-how-does-an-optimal-human-diet-look","last_activity_date":1394556909,"creation_date":1394536520,"answer_count":1,"title":"From a purely biological perspective, how does an optimal human diet look?","body":"<p>There is hardly any subject as contested in the media as what humans should eat.
