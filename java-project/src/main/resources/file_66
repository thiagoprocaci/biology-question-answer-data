Given that our closest relatives the great apes are all quadrupedal, our ancestors at one point must have also been quadrupedal. In fact we as humans are mainly quadrupedal between our first nine to fifteen months of postnatal life. As adults we still engage in quadrupedal behaviors from time to time. For instance, humans often copulate, climb steep hills and walk through thick underbrush on all fours. Because all great apes also engage in bipedal behaviors the difference between us and them is one of frequency. As adults we are much more likely to be bipedal while great apes are much more likely to be on all fours. Because changes in behavior precede changes in structure, to diagnose fossil behaviors we use characters that change during the individual's lifetime in response to practiced behaviors (i.e if we used characters that are mainly inherited to diagnose behaviors we would not know if it is the fossil in question that practiced these behaviors or an ancestor of the fossil that did). In the case of Lucy we can use the x-sectional area of the arm bone vs the x-sectional area of the lumbar vertebra. Bone x-sections change during our lifetime in response to the loads placed on them.  Because bipeds place all their upper body weight on their lower back vertebrae and none on their arms, while quadrupeds distribute their upper body weight on their arms, it would be expected that a biped have a much larger lumbar and smaller arm x-sectional area than a quadruped. This expectation is confirmed in comparisons of humans to great apes, or to baboons and other large monkeys. Notably, Lucy shows ratios that are most similar to baboons (a small lower back and large arms) suggesting it wasn't mainly a biped but often practiced quadrupedal behaviors. Lucy does not preserve a foramen magnum and shows no pelvic characters that are exclusive to bipeds. As you note it only preserves a thigh bone, a leg bone, a single foot bone and two toe bones, none of which show exclusively bipedal characters. The foot bones of the first family fossils which are ~200,000 yrs older than Lucy and have been assumed to be the same as Lucy(but may not be) show a gorilla-like foot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, paleontologist would not gain as much fame or money if they found a possible ape ancestor.  As such to be able to claim it is human they claim these fossils are bipeds using whatever human-like characters they exhibit to associate the fossil to bipedality. More than likely Lucy represents an African great ape that diverged from the common human African ape group around the time of the chimpanzees/gorilla/human split. Lucy is thus a human ancestor and a biped for convenience sake and not based on facts.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":26330,"question_id":9791,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9791/what-is-the-evidence-that-australopithecines-were-bipedal","last_activity_date":1420135365,"creation_date":1376583536,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is the evidence that australopithecines were bipedal?","body":"<p>Before the discovery of <em>Australopithecus afarensis<\/em> in the 1970s, most anthropologists believed that an increase in brain capacity had preceded bipedal locomotion.

A species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case formed from a personal name that is Latin, or from a modern personal name that is or has been latinized, is to be formed in accordance with the rules of Latin grammar.<\/p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Examples. Margaret, if latinized to Margarita or Margaretha, gives the genitives margaritae or margarethae; similarly Nicolaus Poda, even though the name of a man, if accepted as a Latin name, gives podae; Victor and Hercules, if accepted as Latin names, give victoris and herculis; the name of Plinius, a Roman, even though anglicized to Pliny, gives plinii; Fabricius and Sartorius, if treated as Latin names, give fabricii and sartorii, but if treated as modern names give fabriciusi and sartoriusi; Cuvier, if latinized to Cuvierius, gives cuvierii.<\/p>\n  <\/blockquote>\n  \n  <p>31.1.2. A species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case (see Article 11.9.1.3) formed directly from a modern personal name, is to be formed by adding to the stem of that name -i if the personal name is that of a man, -orum if of men or of man (men) and woman (women) together, -ae if of a woman, and -arum if of women; the stem of such a name is determined by the action of the original author when forming the genitive.<\/p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Example. Under this provision, the species-group names podai from Poda, victori from Victor, and cuvieri from Cuvier are admissible. The names puckridgei and puckridgi may be formed from Puckridge.<\/p>\n  <\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Similar rules apply for genus and family names.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since your example was a new genus and species, it didn't \"fit\" into previous categories (in the future, if and when similar discoveries are made that shed light on the genus' relation to others, the name can and will be changed accordingly, with or without the authors' approval).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the research team that discovered the taxon, the genus name Dreadnoughtus \"alludes to the gigantic body size of the (which presumably rendered healthy adult individuals nearly impervious to attack)\" and to the two dreadnought battleships of the Argentine Navy, the ARA Rivadavia and ARA Moreno.

Given that the pH of blood is about 7.4 and better to stay that way, the base/acid pair, $\\ce{[HCO3_^{-}]/[H2CO3]}$ (pKa=6.4) (plus a whole bunch of various proteins such as albumins in blood, all of which has its own pKa) does provide a good buffer capacity around that pH.<\/p>\n\n<p>True, $\\ce{CO2}$ is constantly removed through respiration, but it is also constantly generated by cellular respiration, making $\\ce{H2CO3&lt;=&gt;CO2 + H2O}$ a \"volatile equilibrium\" and keeping both $\\ce{HCO3_^{-}}$ and $\\ce{H2CO3}$ in high enough concentration to sustain its buffer capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>HCl has a pKa of about -7 so it <i>would<\/i> make a good buffer around pH of -7. In an aqueous environment, all HCl molecules will 100% dissociate, and no $\\ce{H+}$ will ever bind to $\\ce{Cl-}$ because water itself will first \"hijack\" the proton as  $\\ce{H3O+}$ (pKa=-1.74) before $\\ce{Cl-}$ by about five order of magnitude. <\/p>\n\n<p>---EDIT---<\/p>\n\n<p>You may be thinking that when cells release $\\ce{CO2}$ to the blood, $\\ce{H2CO3}$ would be the first product, and in order for $\\ce{H2CO3}$'s conjugate base to work as a base to absorb any extra $\\ce{H+}$, first it must release a $\\ce{H+}$, resulting in no net change in free $\\ce{H+}$ and hence no capacity in balancing extra or insufficient $\\ce{H+}$ to maintain the pH. Indeed, if $\\ce{H2CO3}$ is the <i>ONLY<\/i> chemical species in the blood when it would not be a buffer. A buffer requires at least two species -- a potential proton donor and a potential proton acceptor, both of which in high and comparable concentration. pH is a measure of external free $\\ce{H+}$, a result of final proton balance of all the acid and base in the blood, dictated by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation<\/a>. Thus when $\\ce{H2CO3}$ is released in the blood, the blood's basic pH will causes most of $\\ce{H2CO3}$ to become $\\ce{HCO3_^{-}}$, releasing free proton. Again IF that's all the $\\ce{HCO3_^{-}}$ in the blood after being made from $\\ce{H2CO3}$, the blood's pH will drop, but there is already abundant amount of $\\ce{HCO3_^{-}}$ in the blood, helping the system to reach new equilibrium. Of course, the buffer capacity of blood is not infinite.

The Hamilton's rule describe the direction (and not the dynamic) of how a social traits evolve. A social trait is any trait which does not only affect the fitness of its carrier but also affect the fitness of other individuals in the population. Theoretically, all (or almost) traits are actually somehow social traits.<\/p>\n\n<p>$RB&gt;C$ is a simplistic way of looking at Hamilton's rule which might bring you to some confusion. This formula makes more sense to me by replacing $B$ by $\\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dx}$ and $C$ by $\\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dy}$. $w(x,y,z)$ is the fitness function of a focal individual expressing trait $x$ and interacting with an individual draw from a subpopulation expressing trait $y$ (expected value of the probability distribution of trait expression of individuals in the subpopulation) in a population expressing trait $z$ (expected value again). In the particular case where there is no population structure $y$ equals $z$. $\\frac{dw(...)}{dx}$ describes the partial derivative of the fitness function according to the variable $x$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore the Hamilton's rule can be rewritten as:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$R\\cdot\\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dx}&gt;\\frac{dw(x,y,z)}{dy}$$ where $R$ is the coefficient of relatedness which can itself be expressed as a correlation between the variables $x$ and $y$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Altruistic behavior evolves if (but not \"if and only if\") this rule is respected.

Therefore the trait will evolve under genetic drift alone. While the allele frequencies are modified by drift, the Hamilton's rule might (or might not) differ from the equality and then the trait would not be neutral anymore.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10756,"question_id":10742,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1420017564},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":10770,"edited":false,"creation_date":1381170574,"comment_id":14291,"body":"Thanks for such a wonderful answer !

A first unrelated male (r=0) is genetically coded to help raise their offspring by an allele (selfless) at the \"sociality\" gene. A second male, also with r=0, has a different allele (selfish) at the same locus which makes him not help with offspring care. The pair raises 4 offspring if they go it alone, and 10 if another male helps. By helping, a male sacrifices his ability to mate so produces no offspring. Going it on his own he would produce 4 offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>By helping, when r=0, a male passes on no copies of his genes to the next generation (fitness = 0, no offspring in the next generation have genes that are identical by descent [ibd] to his), by being selfish he passes on 4ibd copies of half of his genes (fitness = 2 = 4*0.5). Thus the male carrying the selfish allele should do better and genes promoting social behavior should not evolve in the population because 0*(10)&lt;2 (by helping he sacrifices the fitness score of 2, this is the cost).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now with related males, say the father's brothers. This time the males will on average be related to the offspring of the pair with a relatedness coefficient of r=0.25. With the same results of helping and selfish behavior, genes for social behavior should evolve because 0.25*10>2, the selfless male has more IBD genes in the population than the selfish male. The next generation would have many individuals in it with the selfless allele.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hamilton's rule is used to estimate whether \"selfless\" type alleles will spread through a population,<\/strong> to do so there must be some sort of relatedness within a group otherwise r=0 so rB will never be greater than C. In populations where relatives stay together there is more chance that altruistic behavior will affect a relative, when relatives can't/don't disperse away from each other much then genes promoting altruism should evolve. In more fluid societies they should not be as common.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hamilton's rule is not definitive though.<\/strong> The closer that rB and C are to each other, the weaker selection will be at driving out alleles which reduce fitness, that is because the gain of having the correct allele is so marginal. For example, if r=0.5, B=100, and C=49, then selfless alleles are 2% fitter than selfish alleles. In comparison, if we keep r=0.5 and B=100, but change C to 40, then the rB>C still holds and selfless alleles have more strongly favorable selection (they are 25% fitter) so will spread more rapidly. If C=0 the behavior is likely to evolve because r=0 is unlikely in a population (even if you only include polymorphic loci).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What would happen if rB=C? Will an individual perform the altruistic\n  act?\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Whether animals can use Hamilton's rule to decide behaviors plastically is different application of the equation in Hamilton's rule.<\/strong> It is a similar concept, but evolution does not happen with the individual; the genetic makeup of an individual will not change as a result of selection. However, ignoring the definition of how Hamilton's rule is used you could use the same equation to estimate likely behavioral outcomes when an individual is given a choice. Here is an example where an individual is given the option to give or keep food and can judge relatedness, it is a very simplified model. <\/p>\n\n<p>Example: A locus has two alleles G and g. Individuals can then be GG, Gg, and gg and each genotype has an easily discernible unique trait. Thus when a GG individual meets a GG individual it knows it is perfectly related, r=1. For Gg r=0.5, and gg r=0. When the individuals meet our focal individual (GG) has the option to either provide something for the other one or not provide (let's say give it some food). <\/p>\n\n<p>For our GG individual the cost of providing the food to the other is the energy it took to find the food, say 50 calories. The benefit to the recipient is the energy within the food, lets say 120 calories. Thus we can say, GG should give the food to the other individual if the other is GG (because 1*120 > 50) or Gg (0.5*120 > 50) but not when it is gg (0*120 &lt; 50). If we reduce the value of the food to 80 calories it becomes that GG should not help Gg (0.5*80 &lt; 120).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>There are a few limitations to consider...<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, how well can an individual quantify relatedness? Just using Wrights Coefficient of Relatedness we would come out with roughly accurate measures on average. But there is variability due to mutations and the second law of Mendelian inheritance; independent assortment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, how well can an individual judge benefit of its actions? The effect on the recipient is likely to be complex, it could have serious knock-on effects such as increased fitness later in life, longer lifespan, the action might reduce predation risk for the recipient that day etc..<\/p>\n\n<p>Thirdly and similarly, how well can the provider judge the cost it incurs? If it is giving away food, it does not know if and when it will actually find it's next food item, foraging might cause it to be predated upon, and it might lose out on a mating opportunity if a receptive mate comes by while it is foraging etc..<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>When rB truly equals C (unlikely due to the complex nature of r, B and C) or is approximately equal,<\/strong> then the individual will be less likely to make the correct choice. When it is obvious that the cost is large and benefit is small it is more likely to make the correct decision. This is analogous to the ability of selection to drive out the incorrect allele as outlined above.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This is a rewrite of a previous answer made after some thinking and I think it provides a much better answer than the previous incarnation which I have deleted<\/em><\/p>\n","answer_id":10770,"question_id":10742,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10742/what-if-rb-c-in-hamiltons-rule","last_activity_date":1420017564,"creation_date":1381085819,"answer_count":3,"title":"What if rB=C in hamilton's rule?","body":"<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton.27s_rule\">Hamilton's rule<\/a> states that if rB>C then a gene giving altruistic behaviour will increase in frequency in the population.

These are mostly nematodes and insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally an operon is a functional DNA unit which contains a cluster of genes which are regulated by one promoter/repressor element and which are transcribed together. These are genes which functionally work together in a close context. A good example for this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_operon\" rel=\"nofollow\">lac operon<\/a> in bacteria. <\/p>\n\n<p>In Prokaryotes the expression of the operon leads to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA#Monocistronic_versus_polycistronic_mRNA\" rel=\"nofollow\">polycistronic<\/a> (multiple open reading frames on the same transcript) mRNA, which is then translated into proteins. <\/p>\n\n<p>Operons in eukaryotes are also gene clusters (often of functional closely related proteins), which are regulated by one regulatory unit (promoter). See figure 1 from reference 1:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UMqU1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>There are different ways of mRNA arising from this phenomenon. First the mRNA can be dicistronic and most likely has internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) which allows the initiation (or re-initiation) of the translation of the second gene. Another possibility is the cleavage of the primary mRNA strand into two (or more) monocistronic mRNAs. And finally it is also possible that the dicistronic transcript is alternatively spliced to get different (monocistronic) mRNAs.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in the details of eukaryotic operons, I strongly recommend reading at least the first reference (and probably also following up some of the related citations (on the right on the NIH website)).<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15642184\" rel=\"nofollow\">Operons in eukaryotes.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://memo.cgu.edu.tw/cgmj/3205/320503.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Insights into Polycistronic Transcripts in Eukaryotes<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":26265,"question_id":26258,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1419975876}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26258/what-is-an-operon","last_activity_date":1419975876,"creation_date":1419860903,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is an operon?","body":"<p>What is an operon in a eukaryotic cell, and how does it regulate the expression of genes?

A telomerase treatment would probably do more harm than good, and may be completely unnecessary in the first place. <\/p>\n\n<p>Betts and coworkers published <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/1077.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a study in which they examined telomere length in cloned cattle<\/a>. They found that while telomere length in cloned embryos does start out somewhat shorter than in naturally produced embryos, by the time that the normal processes of embryonic development were in full swing telomere length in cloned and natural embryos was equivalent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Betts' results make sense in light of the fact that telomerase activity (and the activity of many, many related proteins) is normally upregulated in embryonic cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for Dolly, while it is true that her telomeres were shorter than those of an average age-matched sheep at the time of her death, it's far from clear that those short telomeres had anything to do with her decline. Also keep in mind that she didn't just keel over suddenly in the night, she was euthanized. A subsequent autopsy showed that she had a form of lung cancer caused by a retrovirus common in sheep.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Edit: why were Dolly's telomeres shortened?<\/h3>\n\n<p>This is a good question, as the findings of shortened telomeres in Dolly's case do contradict the findings in the Betts paper. Clearly we need more citations:<\/p>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v399/n6734/full/399316b0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Analysis of telomere lengths in cloned sheep.\" Shiels et al, 1999<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This is the original citation for the claim that Dolly's telomeres were shortened. There isn't too much extra information to be had as it's a very short paper (1 page letter). They did look at other cloned sheep created from types of cells other than skin cells (as Dolly was) and saw the same kind of telomere shortening relative to controls. They also make a point of mentioning that Dolly's telomere length may be within the normal variation for sheep.<\/p>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://www.biolreprod.org/content/66/6/1649.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Remarkable differences in telomere lengths among cloned cattle derived from different cell types.\" Miyashita et al, 2002<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The investigators found that telomere length in cloned cattle was strongly dependent on the type of cell from which the clone was derived. For example, clones made from mammary cells tended to have shortened telomeres, whereas those derived from muscle cells had normal length telomeres.<\/p>\n\n<p>-<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.20279/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"The analysis of telomere length and telomerase activity in cloned pigs and cows.\", Jeon, 2005<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This group found that cloned cattle had normal length telomeres, whereas cloned pigs had elongated telomeres. By way of explaining these results, they found that telomerase activity was upregulated in cloned pigs relative to control pigs, whereas telomerase activity in cloned cattle matched that of control cattle.<\/p>\n\n<p>How should we take all of this information? At the very least we can say that telomere length in clones is highly dependent on species and on source tissue, and that telomere length can increase, decrease, or stay the same in cloned animals relative to control animals. Clearly telomere length in cloned animals is a fiddly property. It is very likely that it also depends on the exact details of the cloning protocol as it was carried out (i.e. how much did the experimenter's hands shake when they inserted the needle to suck out the nucleus?, etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>So I would say not to read too much into Dolly's shortened telomeres. They may have been a result of her being a clone, or they may have been a result of natural variation. In either case the shortened telomeres were not linked to her ill-health, and it's likely that small tweaks to the cloning protocol would eliminate any telomere length discrepancies in future clones.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26239,"question_id":26237,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1419894576}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26237/cloning-and-telomeres","last_activity_date":1419894576,"creation_date":1419782679,"answer_count":1,"title":"Cloning and Telomeres","body":"<p>I read that the length of telomeres in Dolly was shorter, because the DNA was taken from an old sheep.

I saw her do it, ran across many buried duck eggs while gardening, and could immediately smell when she was enjoying one.<\/p>\n\n<p>All that to say what smells good to a dog has nothing to do with what is acceptable to you. Many of your \"dislikes\" are <em>conditioned<\/em>: living in a society where cleanliness is valued and clean water is available, humans in such societies can afford to snub their noses at less sanitized things.<\/p>\n\n<p>Manure may well elicit a completely different reaction to a farmer, who saves it carefully before spreading it on his fields to enrich the soil. To him, it might be the smell of a good crop next summer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many species exhibit corprophagia. It's not known why dogs (some, far from all) do this. Rabbits, for instance, eat their own feces after their first movement of the day. This is normal and nutritional for them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eating the feces of <em>other species, particularly herbivores<\/em>, is common among dogs and isn\u2019t considered abnormal, just undesirable. My (same) dog followed my goats around like they were Pez dispensers. Since dogs can't digest cellulose, they get some of the advantage of eating plants this way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex ruminant digestive system. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft fecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. Consuming these cecotropes is important for adequate nutritional intake of Vitamin B12. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.<\/p>\n\n<p>Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the feces of their mother to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation found on the savanna and in the jungle. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eating garbage and human feces is thought to be one function of dogs during their early domestication, some 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. They served as our first waste management workers, helping to keep the areas around human settlements clean. A study of village dogs in Zimbabwe revealed that feces made up about 25% of the dogs\u2019 overall diet, with human feces making up a large part of that percentage. <\/p>\n\n<p><sub>Coprophagia<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882606\">Daily rhythms of food intake and feces reingestion in the degu, an herbivorous Chilean rodent: optimizing digestion through coprophagy<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-3306.1977.tb04010.x/abstract;jsessionid=67F2A980089E9959F36A20ACE36D917E.f01t03\">Coprophagia as seen in Thoroughbred Foals<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":26246,"question_id":26244,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26244/why-are-canines-not-nauseated-by-similar-foodstuffs-state-of-decay-as-human-bein","last_activity_date":1419809196,"creation_date":1419798835,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why are canines not nauseated by similar foodstuffs/state of decay as human beings?","body":"<p>I am continually surprised at the items my pet dog is willing to ingest.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I understand part of the consumption is driven by nutritional instincts (licking salty liquids such as sweat) or nurturing instincts (eating baby faeces to prevent predators) but why does an animal with a sense of smell many thousands of times greater than our own not become nauseated by the same substances, smells or conditions that humans do? <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sweat<\/li>\n<li>Faeces<\/li>\n<li>Decayed foodstuffs<\/li>\n<li>Assorted garbage <\/li>\n<li>Untreated and/or dirty water<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I have known my dog to bury a piece of rotting pork only to dig it up several months later for consumption.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition I watched dogs refuse to eat certain items (spicy meat etc) until their owner makes a move to take it back at which point the animal will swallow the item causing a gag, hacking couch or nasal clearance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there a biological mechanism that suppresses the gag reflex in canines, is the need to consume overpowering their distaste or do they simply not find such substances unpalatable?<\/p>\n","question_id":26244,"tags":["zoology"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49d0d23657ec45eeb254f56f2a0ff6a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":86,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/86/masi","reputation":2608,"display_name":"Masi","accept_rate":77},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1419804563,"creation_date":1411125242,"body":"<p>Cortisol is directly given to the patient - it is then called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol#Pharmacology\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydrocortisone<\/a>.

While humans react in roughly the same way to similar stimuli (e.g. both a cranberry and a tomato are seen as <em>red<\/em>, the destruction of tissue is felt as <em>painful<\/em>), the intensity tends to be different. Also, many stimuli elicit not just a knowledge of the state of the world or one's body, but also a reaction (e.g. shivering when cold, or emotions like fear when physical pain is felt), and these reactions differ between humans too. So, on a very general level, it can be answered with \"Because that's how human perception works\". <\/p>\n\n<p>I know that this is a very unsatisfactory answer, so here are some factors off the top of my head. For any given case, one or more of them will cause the difference, and you cannot tell which ones from casual observation. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your observation of \"<em>similar clothing<\/em>\" could have been incorrect. For example, an acrylic sweater can look exactly like a sheep wool sweater, but warms much less. Or, slightly shorter sleeves can cause much cooling if they leave the wrist exposed. Layering is also very important, and we generally only notice the uppermost clothing layer. <\/li>\n<li>Your observation of \"<em>similar body structure<\/em>\" could have been not precise enough. People who have the same appearance can have different amounts and distributions of body fat. Maybe one person is simply better insulated than another one. <\/li>\n<li>The state of their <em>circulatory system<\/em> was different. Vasoconstriction and vasodilation will change the skin temperature, which is sensed by peripheral thermoreceptors. <\/li>\n<li><em>Estrogen<\/em> is involved in thermal perception. The gender of the person and the current point in the menstrual cycle (or pregnancy) in women will make a difference. <\/li>\n<li>The <em>circadian cycle<\/em> of the two people is probably not perfectly synchronised. Core body temperature varies during the cycle, and thermoperception depends on core body temperature too, not just skin temperature. <\/li>\n<li>A different <em>metabolism<\/em> will cause one person to create more body heat than another<\/li>\n<li>Other <em>hormones<\/em> (beyond estrogen and the ones ruling the circadian cycle and metabolism) probably have an effect on thermoperception, but I can't tell you details here. Temperature is regulated in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, so the hormones from it are likely to have an influence. <\/li>\n<li>Normal variations in the two people's <em>neural networks<\/em> will change the intensity of signal perception. People are born with very unconnected neurons, and build unique connections depending on the environment they encounter while growing up. As a result, each person's brain functions slightly differently when given the same input. <\/li>\n<li>Differences in <em>neurotransmitter sensitivity<\/em> can account for the difference in intensity of perception. People sometimes react differently to the same level of neurotransmitter, or also their brains secrete different amounts of neurotransmitter as a response to the same stimulus. These differences exist on an average level (e.g. glutamate can potentially \"do\" more for me than for you) but are also affected by drugs and illness. <\/li>\n<li><em>Attention<\/em> is a major part of perception. The CNS can suppress information from sensory organs at a very low level if the brain is focusing elsewhere. <\/li>\n<li><em>Habit<\/em>: people can intentionally or unintentionally learn to disregard or misinterpret their body sensations. <\/li>\n<li><em>Psychological stress<\/em> increases the core body temperature <\/li>\n<li>The above reasons all assumed differences between a pair of healthy individuals. Some conditions, for example running a <em>fever<\/em>, but also <em>neurological disorders<\/em> anywhere along the complex pathways from sensors to cortex (and the other way round!) or diseases which for some reason alter thermoregulation, will all change the feeling of hot or cold. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This list is probably incomplete. Also, some of the factors I listed will overlap to some extent (e.g. vasodilation is frequently mediated through hormones, and ingrained habits are reflected in neural network connections). But the take away point is: <strong>Human perception is an active process, very far removed from simple \"reporting\" of the state of the environment. It is unrealistic to expect two individuals to have the same perception when exposed to the same stimuli.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>For an in-depth description of how thermoperception and thermoregulation work physiologically, see <a href=\"http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/301/5/R1207\">this summarizing paper<\/a>. <\/p>\n","answer_id":26115,"question_id":5586,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb0f099a03e6a04a993f681e5abd6303?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11716,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11716/kunal24","reputation":174,"display_name":"Kunal24","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1419778557,"creation_date":1419778557,"body":"<p>Human body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to keep, generate, or get rid of heat as the need arises.

But just how ordered or chaotic is it inside a cell? <\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a few thoughts I had. <\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the chaotic vision. Basically a free for all where particles / molecules / complexes go where ever they please. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then a slightly more ordered vision might be of where different organelles inside the cell are like ports. The molecules float between ports and get biased in particular directions by the \"wind\" which would be like particles / molecules / complexes that interact and somehow change the gradient the molecule is on so it flows in a different direction. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then a slightly more ordered one might be with train tracks where the particles follow exact tracks like in graph theory with vertices and edges. So the system would basically ship the particle but not track it and assume that once its left its port (one vertex) it reaches the target port (another vertex) by traveling along the edge. But it has a 100% chance of reaching a vertex once shipped along the edge. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the most ordered version would be like a bunch of organized streets, an address space. The particle basically passes checkpoints and some system keeps track of whether it is crossing the right street, lol sort of like GPS. So at each moment or in discrete time intervals, the system is getting updates where the particle is. <\/p>\n\n<p>Or maybe its none of these.

Something similar may happen in proteins, where ions help to neutralize charges or bridge certain amino acids together and allow the hydrogen bond to form."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":26192,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"edited":false,"creation_date":1419584067,"comment_id":42129,"body":"@user137 In the presence of water (which is the usual state in living cells) there are no ions bound to DNA."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":0,"post_id":26192,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1419657239,"comment_id":42166,"body":"@Chris But there has to be some interaction, when using RNA I have to use a 150mM NaCl buffer to get Poly A and Poly U to bind well."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":26192,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"edited":false,"creation_date":1419673921,"comment_id":42186,"body":"@user137 I am not saying that there is no interaction (which is of course present), but not in the form of &quot;bound&quot; positive ions to the DNA backbone."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1419661130,"creation_date":1419573761,"body":"<p>Sodium Chloride is not \"polar\".

The cells randomly choose sample proteins (possibly viral or cancer proteins) which are degraded by a proteasome into small 8-10 amino-acid length peptides. After that the cell chooses some of these peptides and send them to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum\" rel=\"nofollow\">endoplasmatic reticulum<\/a> in where each of them meet with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I\" rel=\"nofollow\">MHC1 molecule (major histocompability complex)<\/a> and binds to it. After that the cell sends the MHC1-sample complex to its surface. So every cell with nucleus has a lot of MHC1-randomProteinSample on its surface. These samples are checked an immune cell type called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">cytotoxic T-cells<\/a>. These immune cells attach to the MHC1 of other cells using their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCR (T-cell receptor)<\/a> and their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD8 coreceptor<\/a>. The TCR has a part which consist of a random amino-acid sequence. Thanks to this random part it can recognize a very specific pattern of the small peptides which are bound to MHC1. So every cytotoxic T-cell is different and each of them can recognize a very specific pattern with its T-cell receptors. When a T-cell has a pattern match for the first time it waits for verification signal. It gets that signal on its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD28\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD28 receptor<\/a>. The signal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B7_%28protein%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">B7-protein<\/a> is provided by a professional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell#Professional_APCs\" rel=\"nofollow\">APC (antigen-presenting cell)<\/a> which is infected by the virus or which phagocytized the virus, processed it, and now expresses it on MHC1 and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II\" rel=\"nofollow\">MHC2<\/a> (MHC2 is similar to MHC1, but it can be found only on professional APCs). By virus infected APC the MHC1 can be enough to activate the cytotoxic T-cell. By not-infected APC the cytotoxic T-cell requires further help for activation. This help can be provided by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">helper T-cell<\/a>, which attaches to the MHC2 receptor and after the verification it sends the necessary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine\" rel=\"nofollow\">cytokines<\/a> to activate the cytotoxic T-cell. After the activation the cytotoxic T-cell can destroy every cell on which it finds an MHC1 with matching protein sample, and it can proliferate, so make many copies of itself. This whole process (activating the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive immune system<\/a>) takes appr. 3-4 days. Until that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">innate immune system<\/a> holds the infection. The innate immune system is not so specific as the adaptive immune system, but it contains most of the APCs, so these two systems work together in order to defeat the infection. By the next infection there will be already active <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory T-cells<\/a> available, so the whole process will be much faster...

This virus mainly attacks amoeba. It was discovered in 1992. It was one of the biggest viruses ever found.Later, a related virus called the mamavirus was discovered. But, after observing this specimen under an electron microscope, scientist found tiny viral particles attacking the mamavirus. It was called Sputnik. The Sputnik virus hijacks the mamvirus's machinery and depends on the mamavirus to survive.

conjecture.<\/strong> \nThe slightly elevated position causes greater venous return (work against gravity by smooth musculature and thoracic pump). \nWhy this is happening this way is partially based on my question <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19464/fast-standing-and-the-hearts-insufficient-accommodation-of-the-increased-venous\">here<\/a> about <em>Fast standing and the heart's insufficient accommodation of the increased venous return<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XaZdF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where the venous return reacts first the change in the position from supine by shifting the VR1 to VR2. \nThe stroke volume increases initially to SV1 to SV2, while the end diastolic volume from EDV1 to EDV2. \nThe increased stroke volume cannot be maintained long time so the cardiac output shifts to the right from CO1 to CO2.\nSo the initial stroke volume SV1 is the same as SV3 (not in the picture). \nHowever, the EDV has increased (EDV3 >> EDV1) which increases much the lymphatic drainage. \nLymphatic drainage is not dependent on the stroke volume. \nIncreased lymphatic drainage then again increases the circulation of lymph. \nThis then again supports the recovery from the upper respiratory infection where the fine regulation between<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the thoracic pump,<\/li>\n<li>respiratory pump, and <\/li>\n<li>smooth musculature<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>determine the final effect of the body position on the recovery times. \nThe size of the thoracic cavity puts some limitations, for instance.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Cardiology<\/h2>\n\n<p>In some cases, the upper respiratory infection can cause myocarditis. \nThis will decrease the functioning of the heart and cause possible <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>premature atrial contraction, and/or<\/li>\n<li>premature ventricular contraction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Elevated position helps small arterioles of left ventricle supply preload. \nOtherwise, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_beat\" rel=\"nofollow\">ectopic beat<\/a> can be heard or also called \"epics beat\" which is sign of the two previous conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The nurse is educated to listen to the patient and ask for possible jolts and flips in the chest. \nElevating position in such a case can help because of better supply for preload in the left ventricle.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Pathophysiology<\/h2>\n\n<p>Upper respiratory infection is often acute respiratory infection (acute respiratory distress syndrome). \nThere is an increased permeability of the vessels. \nThe fluids and plasma proteins are going through alveoli. \nAcute hyaline membranes are formed. \nCytokines play a big role in this process. \nTo maintain lymph retention, the result of increased venous return compensates. <\/p>\n\n<p>These patients can breath normally in the sitting position. \nThere are also other reasons for the infection:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>overweight - the greater <strong>intra-abdominal pressure<\/strong> $\\to$ more liquid diffused into the lungs OR other organs are suppressed. <\/li>\n<li>Big chest suppresses lungs such that the architecture can change. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Pharmacology<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are different drugs which effect is dependent on posture and position of the body. \nHypertension is a common disease which amount increases during ageing in population. \nLet's take hypertensive drugs as a case study. \nPeripherally acting sympathoplegic drugs are generally dependent on posture more than centrally acting ones. <\/p>\n\n<p>In hypertension treatment, the peripheral acting sympatholegic drugs are used often in combination with diuretics. \nBlood pressure can be under control when blood volume is 95% of normal, but much too high when blood volume is 105% of normal. \nSo this study should be considered with no hypertension and hypertension. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources<\/h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For Pharmacology, Basic and

This is then, by definition, an epigenetic control of gene expression.<\/p>\n\n<p>Histones are basic DNA binding proteins around which DNA is wound to form chromatin. For transcription to occur, transcription factors and RNA polymerase must bind DNA, which generally cannot happen if DNA is wrapped tightly around histones. DNA must therefore be able to come off from and translocate relative to histones in order to expose bare regions. Based on the level of compaction, chromatin can be generally classified as two types:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>euchromatin<\/strong>: loosely bound, transcriptionally active<\/li>\n<li><strong>heterochromatin<\/strong>: tightly bound, transcriptionally repressed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The state of chromatin compaction is determined by specific  post-translational modifications to the residues in the histones' amino-terminal tail. This is the histone code. One commonly talked about and perhaps easiest to understand modifications is acetylation of lysine residues: this is generally considered to activate transcription since it neutralizes the positive charge of the amino acid so the negatively charged DNA isn't attracted as tightly. Phosphorylation of serine or threonine can have a similar effect by introducing negative charges. Other modifications include mono-, di- and trimethylation of lysine and arginine, ubiquitinylation and others that I haven't memorised. Each histone monomer can be modified independently and each has several residues that can be modified; this leads to staggeringly large number of ways in which just a single nucleosome can be modified. Importantly, these modifications can recruit proteins including transcription factors, histone modifiers and chromatin remodellers (which can condense or loosen the chromatin). All of these serve to tightly regulate gene expression. This is an active field of research and what all discovered combinations of modifications do is largely unknown, but certain modifications are often characteristic of active and repressed transcription.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a standard convention for conveying histone modifications. For example, if lysine 23 of histone H3 was acetylated, you would write H3K23Ac. For trimethylation of arginine 3 on histone H4, you would write H4R3Me3. <\/p>\n","answer_id":26126,"question_id":26119,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1419325888}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26119/in-what-sense-is-the-histone-code-a-code","last_activity_date":1419577195,"creation_date":1419318405,"answer_count":3,"title":"In what sense is the \"histone code\" a code?","body":"<p>Since I started learning about molecular cell biology, I have witnessed an increasing amount of attention to this thing called a \"histone code.\" However, unlike the central dogma of molecular cell biology (i.e. DNA RNA Protein), I still feel very confused about what exactly constitutes the histone code.

According to my textbook, catalase is similar to hemoglobin in that it has 4 hemes which cradle an Fe (iron) atom; the iron atom is used to neutralize free radicals when it \"pulls on the substrate's electrons, which brings on the transition state\" after catalase is holding a substrate in its active site. I already know that free radicals have one or more unpaired electrons which make them dangerous as they \"seek out\" an electron to complete its pair on any molecule, atom, or ion it can find, perhaps causing significant tissue damage in the process. I also know that the transition state is a key point in a reaction in which the activation energy required has been met and the reaction will continue spontaneously until it ends. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>My question is, what exactly is happening here that helps to neutralize a free radical, and what is the part after the transition state doing?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess, based on that cofactors generally can be affected during a reaction, perhaps Iron somehow binds with the free radical and share its electrons, effectively neutralizing the unpaired electron as well as using up the Iron atom?

RS\n  rearrangement results in either deletion or inversion of CŒ∫,\n  consequently inactivating Œ∫ L chain expression on that allele. In cell\n  lines with Œª rearrangements, one or usually both Œ∫ alleles are\n  deleted, whereas in Œ∫-expressing B cells the fraction of RS\n  rearrangements is approximately 15%.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In summary: After a point with (probably multiple) Œ∫ rearrangement failures, both Œ∫ loci (usually) get deleted, leaving only Œª.<\/strong> So if a B cell expressing a BCR with Œª is self-reactive, it won't have the chance to rearrange its Œ∫.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there's a lot more involved. For one, it's possible to get a functional and non-self-reactive Œª chain BCR without repeated Œ∫ rearrangement failures.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the quoted passage might be confusing out of context, I'd like to mention briefly that your question's description of light chain recombination is very simplified. In reality, there are many additional mechanisms involved and many different paths to get a functional Œ∫ rearrangement, a functional Œª rearrangement, neither, or even both. Moreover, there's a lot we don't know, since we learn one experiment at a time, and we can't always directly measure what we'd like to.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, rearrangement <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9550405\" rel=\"nofollow\">has been observed to occur simultaneously in  Œ∫ and Œª<\/a>. This fact might explain why it's possible to get a functional Œª chain BCR right away as mentioned above. Second, allelic exclusion (between both Œ∫s and both Œªs) doesn't always work as you and I might expect it to, and a developing B cell can express different BCRs simultaneously (even one with Œ∫ and the other with Œª). Third, due to receptor editing, a B cell has multiple opportunities for a functional Œ∫ chain rearrangement on a single chromosome, meaning that neither Œª nor the second Œ∫ is needed despite an initially nonfunctional Œ∫ rearrangement.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>I highly recommend reading the review article!<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":26145,"question_id":23957,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1419379415}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23957/b-cell-receptor-editing","last_activity_date":1419379415,"creation_date":1415809357,"answer_count":1,"title":"B cell receptor editing","body":"<p>If a B cell contains two mu chains and two lambda chains and is self reactive can it go back and rearrange its kappa light chains?

Therefore, one cannot say that one species is more evolved than another one. It just makes no sense. Being a dominant species/clade for some time (whatever dominant may mean to you) doesn't make this species/clade more evolved than any other one. There is no reason to expect a species where populations are maintained large for a long time to become more intelligent. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Your question should not be specific to intelligence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can think of any other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotypic<\/a> trait (wings, toxins in the skin, good eyes, good smell, strong leaves, etc...) and ask this same question. You seem to assume that being smart should be some kind of goal or necessary direction toward which species should evolve. Following your reasoning I would rather ask why the hagfishes, the oyster, the lampreys or the turtles are so dumb although they exist for so long (way more time than dinosaures have never existed).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefit and cost<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Morover most of these trait have associated cost to the benefice they might bring. For example having a big brain asks for much energy (20% of ATP in humans) and it also has a cost due to its weight. The sperm whale for example has a brain that weights 7.8 kg. Obviously it is not a big cost for such a big animal to carry heavy organs while it would be impossible for a migratory bird to carry such a brain.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>taking different evolutionnary path<\/strong> This part is probably not complete!<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the question of why Homo sapiens are smart while tyranosaurus rex are not or why wings evolved in bat and not in mice is rather interesting and hard to answer. I can think of 2 main causes:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) The newly arising trait (which is usually not the trait you can observe today. Big brain did not appear suddenly, first there were individuals they had slightly bigger brains than the other individuals in the population) is not beneficial over the wildtype trait. There are so many parameters that will affect if a trait is beneficial or not. You can think of the predators, the humidity in the environnement, the social structure, the population size, the type of reproduction, the genetic background etc...<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, think of a species that is fixed, has no social contact, has nothing it can really predict in the environnement. What would an individual from this species do with a brain? Think of a bird that needs to make food stock for the winter. This bird needs to remember where it hide something. It has been found by the way that some birds have an awesome spatial memory, way better than humans.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) The trait never happen to occur (or never in a strong enough individual, or never in a population big enough to not suffer from to much drift while the trait is at low frequency) just because the necessary mutation never happen. Mutation is just a random process.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example. It seems rather hard for a tree to have the necessary mutations to have develop a brain! But we don't need to go to such a extreme example. If you split a population of clone mice in two, the two subpopulation will evolve differently (even in absence of genetic drift (infinite population size)) just because  some mutations occur on one side while some others occur on the other side. Or maybe the same mutation might occur but once in an individual that has low fitness and once in a very fit individual.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Evolution of human cognition abilities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So what are the factors that drive humans to evolve big brains? This question is not solved yet. We have many models to explain this but I don't we have much solutions to test these models. The 2 most common models explain big brains<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>for social purposes (understanding relationship between other individuals, being able to coordinate the movement for a hunt, etc...) <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>due to sexual selection. Being intelligent would be a proxy for having good genes.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>For more information concerning the evolution of human cognition, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> wikipedia article might be a good start.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why do you think mutation is a random process?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Our genetic data are encoded into a succession of 4 types of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna\" rel=\"nofollow\">nucleotide bases<\/a> (A,T,C and G). A mutation results from a modification of this sequence such as a replacement of a T by a C. These mutations are due to mistakes usually while duplicating the DNA. Most of these mistakes do not affect the fitness (survival + reproduction ability) of the individual, very often these mutation are deleterious and rarely these mutations are beneficial. Some mutations are more probable than others but nevertheless some individuals have a higher mutation rate than others. In order to make things slightly more complicated, some sequences have a higher mutation rate than others. For example, the sequence <code>AAAAAAAAAAAA<\/code> is more likely to mutate than the sequence <code>ATGTGCATCTA<\/code>. But even if some mutations are more likely to occur it is still a random process (we couldn't talk about likelihood otherwise!). Two clones living in the exact same environment that both have a baby at the exact same time wil not create babies with the exact same genome given the randomness of mutations. One baby might have a very bad mutation that will make him die, while the other baby might synthesize (=construct) a new enzyme that increases its digestive capacity.<\/p>\n","answer_id":11260,"question_id":11254,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1419349687}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11254/why-were-dinosaurs-not-as-smart-as-we-are","last_activity_date":1419349687,"creation_date":1383413364,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why were dinosaurs not as smart as we are?","body":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur<\/a>, Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135 million years.\nThey had a lot of time to evolve.

The ants had no natural enemies, and it only took 12 of them to take a lizard down in about a minute. Seventy years later, the lizards that live closest to the port where the ants were first introduced have evolved an unlikely strategy for dealing with their antagonists. How unlikely? Well, there's a dance involved, which makes these animals the first on record to employ the West Side Story method of self-defense.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>While other lizards respond to ant attacks by \"sitting still, just hoping the ants would go away,\" these smooth operators developed an ant-shaking shimmy that they've passed on to their kids.

In fact, the scientists couldn't get back to the island until 2004. When they did, they found 5,000 lizard descendants who had not only annihilated the entire indigenous lizard population, but also rewired the shape of their own innards to accommodate the local diet.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Before their introduction to the island, the wall lizards were carnivores, so their digestive systems weren't built for leaf-eating. But on an island short on insects and long on plants, a strictly carnivorous stomach would be a one-way ticket to Deadville. So the lizards developed things called cecal valves, which were muscles that slowed down the process of food digestion and gave them more time to break down plant cellulose. But growing new gut muscles wasn't all the lizards had up their sleeves.

From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond\" rel=\"nofollow\">biologist Jared Diamond<\/a>, the 6 criteria for domestication are as follows:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Flexible diet \u2013 Creatures that are willing to consume a wide variety of food sources and can live off less cumulative food from the food pyramid (such as corn or wheat), particularly food that is not utilized by humans (such as grass and forage) are less expensive to keep in captivity. Carnivores by definition feed primarily or only on flesh, which requires the expenditure of many animals, though they may exploit sources of meat not utilized by humans, such as scraps and vermin.<\/li>\n  <li>Reasonably fast growth rate \u2013 Fast maturity rate compared to the human life span allows breeding intervention and makes the animal useful within an acceptable duration of caretaking. Some large animals require many years before they reach a useful size.<\/li>\n  <li>Ability to be bred in captivity \u2013 Creatures that are reluctant to breed when kept in captivity do not produce useful offspring, and instead are limited to capture in their wild state. Creatures such as the panda, antelope and giant forest hog are territorial when breeding and cannot be maintained in crowded enclosures in captivity.<\/li>\n  <li>Pleasant disposition \u2013 Large creatures that are aggressive toward humans are dangerous to keep in captivity. The African buffalo has an unpredictable nature and is highly dangerous to humans; similarly, although the American bison is raised in enclosed ranges in the Western United States, it is much too dangerous to be regarded as truly domesticated. Although similar to the domesticated pig in many ways, Africa's warthog and bushpig are also dangerous in captivity.<\/li>\n  <li>Temperament which makes it unlikely to panic \u2013 A creature with a nervous disposition is difficult to keep in captivity as it may attempt to flee whenever startled. The gazelle is very flighty and it has a powerful leap that allows it to escape an enclosed pen. Some animals, such as the domestic sheep, still have a strong tendency to panic when their flight zone is encroached upon. However, most sheep also show a flocking instinct, whereby they stay close together when pressed. Livestock with such an instinct may be herded by people and dogs.<\/li>\n  <li>Modifiable social hierarchy \u2013 Social creatures whose herds occupy overlapping ranges and recognize a hierarchy of dominance can be raised to recognize a human as the pack leader.<\/li>\n  <\/ol>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From his Pulitzer prize-winning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel\" rel=\"nofollow\">book<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>We (as a species) domesticated animals (and plants) by selecting traits we sought, and then breeding to keep alive/emphasize these traits. In hunting animals (retrievers, for example), intelligence may be one of those traits. Others might include obedience, speed, agility, even dark-colored coats for camouflage.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's not really correct to say \"more evolved\" as @MarchHo explains in his comment. Rather, you might say \"more docile\", or \"less aggressive\". <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind that less aggressive, domesticated animals are not necessarily more intelligent than their wild counterparts.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/questions/tagged/status-myth\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'status-myth'\" rel=\"tag\">status-myth<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":26079,"question_id":26076,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1419129848},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ad85f81981e5365a21d94114f3926b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":11657,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11657/augurar","reputation":1124,"display_name":"augurar"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":26083,"edited":false,"creation_date":1419161518,"comment_id":41865,"body":"Interesting thoughts.

If you're asking whether domestic animals are more friendly to humans than wild animals, the answer is generally yes.  However, this does not make them \"more evolved\".  Domestic and wild animals are ultimately derived from a shared common ancestor, so they have been evolving for an equal period of time.  In general, domesticated animals have been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding\" rel=\"nofollow\">selectively bred<\/a> for traits that make them useful or appealing to humans, so it is to be expected that they possess more of these traits than their wild relatives.<\/p>\n\n<p>An interesting detail is that, in addition to behavioral traits like increased tameness, many domestic animals tend to display certain physical traits such as floppy ears, shorter faces, and coloration differences, which were not present in their wild ancestors.  A <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.114.165423\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent article<\/a> has proposed that these traits are the result of mild developmental defects which have been selected for by the process of domestication.

Like RNAseq followed by qRT-PCR etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Western blotting is not a robust technique and cross comparisons are difficult because of difference in the avidities/affinities of different antibodies. So comparisons can be made only with one protein-control pair in different conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>LC-MS is more sensitive and less biased(IMO). So the general trick is- don't do westerns for all proteins just report the ones that behave well (say that you \"chose\" these because they are important). I know this is a wrong practice and I should not be advocating it. For your own scientific validation try it with another MS technique; if you used ESI-Quadrupole/ion-Trap etc then try with MALDI-TOF or iTRAQ. Some luddites will continue to cling to westerns.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think it is better to not test the proteins that have low peptide counts. See what is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot\" rel=\"nofollow\">MA plot<\/a>. This is frequently used for microarrays. Here <code>M<\/code> denotes fold change and <code>A<\/code> denotes total expression in both samples. Don't pick proteins that are low in expression in both samples; they might not be meaningful. For example if you have <code>2<\/code> molecules of <code>X<\/code> and <code>100<\/code> molecules of <code>Y<\/code> in control condition and <code>5<\/code> molecules of <code>X<\/code> and <code>200<\/code> molecules of <code>Y<\/code> in test; then the fold change in <code>X<\/code> would seem important; however this change may not be relevant and can be a result of stochastic fluctuation/measurement error.

In <em>E. coli<\/em>, for example the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC98936/\" rel=\"nofollow\">traditional map<\/a> was created based on the F-pili-mediated DNA transfer experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>When whole genome sequences became available it was only natural to continue the traditionally defined numeration in terms of placing the \"base-pair one\".

Just to give an example of how the dilemma was solved for the <em>Buchnera<\/em> genome: it was \"assumed the DnaA box upstream of the gidA gene is the replication origin\" and the authors decided to designate \"<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6800/full/407081a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the start of the DnaA box as base pair one<\/a>\".<\/p>\n\n<p>As you see, still, even if the authors try to define \"base-pair one\" based on the position of ori, the problem is that this point depends on the ori-searching tool one uses and on the contemporary understanding of how ori-sites look like (direct determination of origins of replications are in many cases not easy). See e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC156607/table/T1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this table<\/a> with a revision of ori locations in a set of genomes: while most of the genomes received their numeration irrespective of ori, some of them were indeed bound to it, but the new analysis showed that these locations were inaccurate.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26068,"question_id":26056,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1419184734}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26056/is-there-a-rule-for-the-annotation-of-the-basepair-or-gene-locus-origin-in-bacte","last_activity_date":1419184734,"creation_date":1419003050,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there a rule for the annotation of the basepair or gene locus origin in bacterial genomes?","body":"<p>Since all bacteria have one circular chromosome, there is no designated origin to start the systematic gene locus numbering.

You may end up with a good collection of objectives for less than 100\u20ac.\nThat is surely tempting, and it may actually be OK as a start.<br>\nHowever, I personally think that it is better to own a good lower magnification objective than a cheap high-magnification one, so be always be a bit wary about offers that look too good to be true (especially for new piece of equipment).<\/p>\n\n<p>I would strongly suggest getting a binocular microscope (so with two eyepieces), rather than a monocular one. Makes life much easier. \nAlso, be sure to have a camera attachment. While a camera may not be strictly necessary, especially at the beginning, it's better to have an attachment so that you can add one in the future, if you feel the need of taking pictures. Although many microscopes have specialized attachments for microscope cameras, you can get away with using your own normal camera, or even your cellphone, if you position it correctly (may need some DIY depending on the situation). \nThis <a href=\"http://www.microbehunter.com/connecting-a-camera-to-a-microscope/\" rel=\"nofollow\">page<\/a> has very detailed explanations on how to connect a camera to a microscope.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for your samples, plants are a very good and easy thing to start observing. Onions are probably one of the best samples to start with.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may also want to stain your samples. Probably the easiest thing to get is methylene blue, which should be a few euros for 20-30 ml. However, fountain pen ink <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/School_Science/Staining_onion_cells_without_methylene_blue\" rel=\"nofollow\">works as well<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whenever you use chemicals, remember to look for their safety data sheet (MSDS). Methylene blue is pretty safe to work with, provided you don't swallow it (doh...) and use gloves (standard latex gloves are OK). Be careful because it stains and can be a bit messy, which is true for pen ink as well!<\/p>\n\n<p>Crystals are also pretty cool to watch under a microscope: take a coverslip, put on a drop of sugary or salty water and wait for it to dry!<\/p>\n","answer_id":19992,"question_id":19990,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1412704027},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QarBg.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1368,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1368/daniel","reputation":1849,"display_name":"daniel","accept_rate":68},"score":9,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8729233d525a654914051bf8c1234c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":115,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico","reputation":6011,"display_name":"nico","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":19995,"edited":false,"creation_date":1406472367,"comment_id":29870,"body":"I have mixed feeling about this.
