It does, indeed, affect humans.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is that recessive mutations become more likely to affect the survival of the offspring of relatives. Imagine that you have a mutation affecting, say, some gene that's critical to your metabolism, which is entirely possible. But, since you have two copies of the gene and only one of them is faulty, you are not affected by this. Nevertheless, you, by chance, pass the non-functional one on to a couple of your kids, who are also not affected due to only having one copy as well. They, in turn, pass it on to one or more of their kids. Now, two of them, cousins, have a kid. The kid gets both copies and can no longer properly metabolize something due to having two faulty copies of the gene. This can prove to be fatal or at least severely debilitating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, lest you think this is improbable, there are on average <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/estimating-human-mutation-rate-direct.html\">70-something mutations per generation<\/a>. Some of those will be neutral in effect, others will be detrimental. Once an offspring gets two copies of those detrimental alleles, then there could be serious health effects. The likelihood of an offspring getting two copies decreases as the relatedness of its parents decreases. So, sibling or parent/child pairings would be the most likely to produce offspring with the problems. Pairing between 3rd generation (First-cousins) or any pairings between them and their siblings, parents, aunts/uncles or grand-parents would be the next most likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>So yes, first-cousins marrying and having kids is a bad idea for very basic scientific reasons. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I missed the \"as a species\" part of your question.

Even now, there is continued elevated risk of certain rare genetic diseases in these populations. As for the species as a whole, it is likely to be really detrimental only if the effective population size of the species becomes really low: a general rule of thumb used by conservation biologists is that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_population_size\">effective population size<\/a> should be at least 50 to avoid the effects of inbreeding (and 500 to avoid the effects of genetic drift) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=50%2F500+rule\">50/500 rule<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry about the confusion. <\/p>\n","answer_id":9390,"question_id":9388,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1374581381}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9388/is-it-really-detrimental-to-humans-as-a-species-to-reproduce-with-ones-own-firs","last_activity_date":1375279803,"creation_date":1374570589,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is it really detrimental to humans as a species to reproduce with one's own first cousin?","body":"<p>Tired of hearing of these urban legends and popular opinions, I ask this question here to see if there really is scientific merit to this belief. My questions is, is it really \"harmful\" for a person to reproduce with his/her own first cousin? Everyone, at least in America, seems to think that this is incest which I completely dismiss because incest is purely a religious concept. The next argument I get is that we want more genetic diversity and having offspring with a first cousin is detrimental to our survival as a species. If you have any genetic weaknesses then your cousin is likely to be carrying them as well and then the chances of your offspring carrying them increase and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't really believe any of this. It is rather well known (or may be not so well known) that only a very small percentage of a human individual is different from another human individual's genome.

Are there any mushrooms that they can't eat without dying? <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Dr. John Rippon, an IMA member and world expert on fungal diseases, squirrels have an interesting adaptation that allows them to eat mushrooms containing deadly amanita-toxins without being affected. There are three important chemicals in the amanitas. Two will knock you right off, but are destroyed in cooking. The third one is the interesting one: it consists of the second amanitin, bound tightly to a glycoprotein molecule. When we digest the mushroom, the enzymes in our gut break the bond between the toxin and the glycoprotein, leaving the toxin free to enter our bloodstream, while the glycoprotein is excreted (a glycoprotein is a [protein containing sugar molecules and accounts for the viscous properties of mucus], in case you don't know). What the squirrels have done is line their gut with a toxin-compatible glycoprotein, so that as soon as it gets split from its original glycoprotein molecule, it gets rebound to the squirrel glycoprotein, and excreted along with it. Obviously, the squirrels don't cook their food to destroy the first two molecules, but presumably those get bound in exactly the same way. Thus, squirrels and a few other animals (guinea pigs also, I believe) can eat mushrooms that are highly toxic to other animals with no ill effects.  <a href=\"http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Terms/squir27.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","question_id":9279,"tags":["mammals","toxicology","mushroom"],"score":2,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"primarily opinion-based","is_answered":false,"view_count":429,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1375176848},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b97348422b155975191606b8ad47a37f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":585,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/585/thejh","reputation":175,"display_name":"thejh"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":0,"post_id":8952,"edited":false,"creation_date":1372179623,"comment_id":11507,"body":"Where geographically was it found, and how large is it?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b97348422b155975191606b8ad47a37f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":585,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/585/thejh","reputation":175,"display_name":"thejh"},"score":0,"post_id":8952,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1372194299,"comment_id":11511,"body":"@kmm: edited to address your questions"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1372196706,"creation_date":1372196706,"body":"<p>As your link suggests, it looks like a female tick of the genus <em>Ixodus<\/em>.

This is handy for all the intelligent things we like to do, but can be rather painful during birth.  Because we walk upright, the size of a newborn's head is actually a non-trivial fact during the birthing process.  There are two major implications.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is that human birth <strong>hurts<\/strong>.  You can watch the birth of other animals and they seem to brush it off, but for humans, forcing that huge head through a relatively small birth canal is difficult.  Evolution has (supposedly) limited the size of the hips because, while that would allow an easier birthing process, it would negatively impact our ability to walk.  As such, it has to hurt.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, in order to make the process easier, humans rotate during birth.

I suppose therefore they might say that there's a fundamental factor (a key trait, and therefore open adaptive zones) driving diversification, and therefore might not agree with you that diversification would necessarily beget more diversification (at least, not in the absence of open adaptive zones). For instance, in Hawaiian tetragnathid spiders, ecomorph niches on an island are filled either through immigration from another island or through adaptive diversification <a href=\"http://nature.berkeley.edu/~gillespie/Science.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Gillespie)<\/a>. No ecomorph is represented by two sympatric species, so a niche filled by immigration will presumably not spur adaptive radiation. However, species radiations in Andean lupines <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0601928103\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Hughes and Eastwood)<\/a> and plethodontid salamanders <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2005.3326\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Kozak et al)<\/a> seem not to have been accompanied by any key traits or particular ecological opportunity, and could theoretically be driven by the self-reinforcing mechanism you propose.

It has been implied that these gene duplicates persist in the genome because they quickly find a new niche role.  This paper shows that 30% of 195 new genes that have shown up since two strains of fly have diverged are necessary for viability.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Evolution doesn't let genes sit around because they are completely identical; they can be removed as easily as they show up, only differential function will keep an isoform in the mRNA repertoire for a prolonged time. <\/p>\n","answer_id":8096,"question_id":7734,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7734/what-percentage-of-protein-isoforms-have-different-functions","last_activity_date":1374799329,"creation_date":1364912404,"answer_count":3,"title":"What percentage of protein isoforms have different functions?","body":"<p>I am looking for studies on how many protein isoforms have different functions, preferably in human.

If one protein is nuclear but the other on the plasma membrane, it is highly unlikely that they ever interact even if thermodynamics highly favors complex formation. Interaction between two proteins also depends on their respective conformations, which can further be regulated by events such as post translational modifications (eg., phosphorylation by a kinase), bound nucleotide state (eg., GTP vs GDP in a G protein).

In fact, some argue that the evolution\n  of intelligence is also virtually inevitable, though intelligent\n  organisms could be very different from us.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is yes, with enough time and the same selection effects we would not be surprised if there was a similar pair of independently evolved characters. However, selection acts on random mutations which is not a directed process, therefore for the same characters to evolve you would need mutations to occur that had similar effects. This is why <em>given enough time<\/em> we can see the same responses. Despite the non-random effect of selection, we could consider evolution to be a stochastic process, it only arrives at the same converged point by chance. This is because selection (the main driver of evolution) acts on randomly generated genetic variation thus the direction of the evolutionary trajectory is random.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"..often used to represent the evolution of some random value, or\n  system, over time. This is the probabilistic counterpart to a\n  deterministic process (or deterministic system). Instead of describing\n  a process which can only evolve in one way (as in the case, for\n  example, of solutions of an ordinary differential equation), in a\n  stochastic or random process there is some indeterminacy: even if the\n  initial condition (or starting point) is known, there are several\n  (often infinitely many) directions in which the process may evolve.\" -\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia entry on Stochastic Processes<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><br/><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Following the quote above it may seem that evolution is a directed process, i.e. selection is aiming for a specific target. It is not, selection can only weed out the least fit genotypes and increase the frequency of the better ones, selection has no goal or pre-existing aim. Thus, when discussing stochasticity in evolutionary terms it is perhaps better to use <strong>evolutionary trajectories, to describe the randomly created paths they move along, instead of \"directions.\"<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br/><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>As an example of convergent evolution we could use the peppered moth and a little imagination because this is purely a hypothetical illustration I am making up on the spot<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth#Evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">The peppered moth is famous for once being a white moth that turned dark<\/a> during the industrial revolution, when towns and cities grew and pollution killed the light coloured lichens that helped the light morph hide. This meant, rather suddenly by evolutionary time-scales, the white morph of the moth was not very well camouflaged against the dark bark of the trees. This created a positive selection for darker morphs, as such, alleles which made for dark moths would have spread rapidly in the population. <\/p>\n\n<p>Using a little imagination we can think about two different parts of the world where this same event occurred independently - e.g. <a href=\"http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyc.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glasgow<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Plymouth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plymouth<\/a> in Britain which are quite far apart but both grew expansively during the industrial revolution. In both of these locations we would have seen a simultaneous rapid loss of lichens and increase in the dark moth ecomorph. This would have been convergent evolution because it is likely that they were independent of each other, i.e. the dark moth probably did not evolve in Glasgow and then fly itself down to Plymouth.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9405,"question_id":9398,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1374659967}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9398/ecomorphs-as-evolutionary-definitions","last_activity_date":1374659967,"creation_date":1374631272,"answer_count":2,"title":"Ecomorphs as evolutionary definitions","body":"<p>There have been demonstrations of ecomorphs in different taxa, where each morphology type is associated to a single environment.

If food is abundant but so are predators, then clearly predator evasion will be of supreme importance. If food is scarce, then perhaps metabolism-related traits will be under strong selective pressure. But it's important to remember that just because one selective pressure is stronger doesn't mean that the rest disappear. Thus, the individual's survival is dependent upon really a composite fitness that depends on a countless array of selective pressures, some of which may be larger components than others. The competition between individuals of the same species is really a complex interplay of fitness effects, then.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for the maxim about outrunning a cheetah, what it's illustrating is that the gazelles are not competing with the cheetah for survival. They're competing with each other. If you want, you could expand it to say \"...just the other gazelles and the rest of the herbivores in the environment\". If a herd of gazelles and a herd of some slower animal are nearby and a cheetah attacks, one of the individuals from the slower species will probably get caught and all the gazelles will get away. The point is that the gazelles and the cheetahs fill very different niches in the environment, so they don't really compete for the same resources (as a matter of fact, one is the primary resource of the other). <\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to determining survival, one talks about fitness only within the context of the population (or, if you want, between species directly competing for the same niche). The less fit members of the population do not survive. Thus, the less fit ones that fail to evade the predator are simply doing a worse job evading the predator than the other members of the population. But it's not only the relative fitness that is important. Imagine that a new predator migrates into the environment, for which none of the prey has any evasive adaptation. Even though there may be a relative fitness between them regarding evading this predator, if even the best individual is not good enough to evade it, they would all have an absolute fitness that is too low to ensure survival. Then the saying breaks down, since none of the gazelles can out-run each other with respect to evading this new predator.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this idiom falls apart when you start talking about asocial species, since there aren't any other individuals around to out-run.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9371,"question_id":9365,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1374488306}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9365/competition-with-other-individuals-of-the-same-species-vs-adaptation-pressure-f","last_activity_date":1374488306,"creation_date":1374415970,"answer_count":1,"title":"Competition with other individuals of the same species vs. adaptation pressure from predators","body":"<p>It is often said \"You don't need to outrun the cheetah, just the other gazelles\", thus emphasizing that greater part of the adaptation pressure comes from competing with other individuals of the same species and not directly from predators/parasites (which are seen as more indirect forces similar to the living conditions imposed by the environment (climate, geophysical factors, etc.))<\/p>\n\n<p>My question is:<\/p>\n\n<p>Isn't there a difference between competing with other individuals of the same species for food, habitats (i.e. resources) and competing with them in avoiding being eaten?<\/p>\n","question_id":9365,"tags":["adaptation"],"score":3,"accepted_answer_id":9371,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":128,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/235bdbadd939d7ec209bcd062eac4e02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4068,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4068/willummaguire","reputation":118,"display_name":"WillumMaguire"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1374433668,"creation_date":1374433668,"body":"<p>Osteoarthritis results from the gradual degradation of articular cartilage.

A newborn male then\n  has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can\n  expect to have more offspring. Therefore parents genetically disposed\n  to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of\n  grandchildren born to them. Therefore the genes for male-producing\n  tendencies spread, and male births become more common. As the 1:1 sex\n  ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males\n  dies away.

Now I realize that some dinosaurs were actually quite tiny, but this is just an example.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Given birds' close genetic link to dinosaurs, could it simply be that they were just doing more with less?  The mammalian brain is a huge caloric burden, so perhaps this would show an efficiency that could be selected for?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus as the title suggests, my main question:<\/p>\n\n<p>Is the ratio of brain mass to body mass still considered to be a valid indication of intelligence of a species in modern (current) neuroscience?  Certainly there are exceptions, but is it still considered the rule of thumb?<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I also wanted to point out the <a href=\"http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/102973\" rel=\"nofollow\">first article(2)<\/a> I started to read after formulating the question.  It made me question the usefulness of encephalization in addressing this issue at all, but I don't/didn't feel adequately trained to evaluate the conclusions of the meta study.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Again, this still leaves us comparing within primates, which still leaves me feeling that <em>Corvidae<\/em> have some really impressive efficiency going on with their overall brain mass.  Which then leads to hope that some dinosaurs could be at least equally intelligent, if not more so (noted that this is complete conjecture).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) Front Hum Neurosci. 2013 Jun 6;7:245. doi:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00245\" rel=\"nofollow\">10.3389/fnhum.2013.00245<\/a>.

The beings just need to settle on precisely which 11 parts of their anatomy to count.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for your actual question, I am unaware of any species with an uneven total number of fingers and I would be surprised if we found one, based on an argument of developmental symmetry and overall (coarse-grained) evolutionarily conserved development plans within major clades of extant animals.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9321,"question_id":9320,"up_vote_count":24,"last_edit_date":1374162454},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":27,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":2,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374156098,"comment_id":12209,"body":"although both <i>C.calamaria<\/i> and &quot;pi&quot; sound similarly delcious"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3934"},"score":0,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374156340,"comment_id":12210,"body":"True, I hadn&#39;t thought about the possibility of radial body designs!"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac36e5dec8be45f4a3ae0969295e6965?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4037,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4037/blem","reputation":183,"display_name":"Blem"},"score":1,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374156572,"comment_id":12211,"body":"Thanks for the answer, hadn&#39;t considered that, now can you teach them to count ;)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5347bf1a28c534a5ec0d68f9ee49824?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4046,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4046/ghoppe","reputation":101,"display_name":"ghoppe"},"score":5,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374166234,"comment_id":12216,"body":"This has 11 votes, so I refuse to add another. sorry."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":0,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374168810,"comment_id":12217,"body":"this is a good answer since bilateral symmetry is what creates even numbers of digits."},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3934"},"score":0,"post_id":9322,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374169676,"comment_id":12222,"body":"On the other hand, can we count a starfish arm as a digit?

This is not related to better vision, but better health.<\/p>\n\n<p>The mammalian eye senses the light by the conventional rode and cone cells. However, a third light-sensing cell type <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01761\" rel=\"nofollow\">has been recently identified<\/a>. This third light-sensor is based on <strong>melanopsin<\/strong>-positive cells. While rod and cone cells respond best to white, full spectrum light, melanopsin cells only respond to a specific bandwidth of blue light, in the range of 446-477 nanometers. These cells connect and regulate brain centers responsible for circadian rhythms. Therefore, during the night, blue-light exposure <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.118-a22\" rel=\"nofollow\">might interfere<\/a> with circadian rhytms facilitating the onset of depression and other metabolic derangements associated with circadian cycle <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1659/why-is-maintaining-a-circadian-rhythm-important\">see another SE question<\/a>. White light contains also blue light, while red light does not. This is apparently the rationale to claim that red light is less harmful. However, no clinical evidence is available to my knowledge, and the threshold of blue light required to stimulate melanopsin receptors is probably over the common night illumination. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01761\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <strong>Hattar S, Lucas RJ, Mrosovsky N, Thompson S, Douglas RH, Hankins MW, Lem J, Biel M, Hofmann F, Foster RG, et al.<\/strong>. 2003.

Red light is routinely used by scientific laboratories to do low light dissections of retinas, and of course it is used in other low light contexts such as printing plate development.<\/p>\n\n<p>In both of the above contexts, you have a clear subject: the retina being dissected or the printing plate being developed.  In the case of the printing plate the film has been designed to be specifically non-reactive to red light, so red light is used because <strong>your eyes can see it, but the film doesn't react to it<\/strong>.  Similarly in some scientific settings it makes sense to use red light during dissections.  Mice lack a long wavelength opsin, and therefore using a dim red light allows the experimenter to have a <strong>relative sight advantage compared to the mouse<\/strong> when keeping the mouse dark adapted.<\/p>\n\n<p>But in the case you're asking about, there is no film or animal to serve as a second party.  So is there any intrinsic advantage to using red light?  As it turns out, there is.  The fovea, which is in the center of our eye and used for high acuity vision, has no rods and primarily L- or red sensitive cones.  Note the high density center area which lacks blue sensitive cones and has <a href=\"http://www.psych.ndsu.nodak.edu/mccourt/Psy460/Color%20Vision/Color%20Vision.html\">2:1 red to green cones<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wIbcE.jpg\" alt=\"retinal mosaic\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So by having red light present, you stimulate this area.  But red light is present in white light, too, why not just use that?  Leonardo's answer comes the closest, but it's a little off.  <strong>Red light is used because it preferentially stimulates L cones more than rods<\/strong>, but you are definitely not able to preserve night vision by using red light.  Why not?  Well it may look like it is possible to exclusively stimulate cones from the chromatic sensitivity figure <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UvNmc.png\" alt=\"chromatic sensitivity\"><\/p>\n\n<p>But that figure is 1) normalized and 2) not indicative of synaptic signal processing.  1000's of rods can converge onto a single ganglion cell, where cone convergence in the fovea can be on the order of a single cone per ganglion cell.  When it comes to perception, in order to compare the black rod line above with the red L-cone line you'd have to magnify it dramatically in size.  Practically speaking, it is nearly impossible to stimulate cone pathways without stimulating rod pathways when using a relatively broad spectrum LED that you're powering with a battery.  Maybe with a high power infrared laser.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So <strong>the purpose of using red light is to attempt to balance the activation of high sensitivity (red insensitive) rods with that of the low sensitivity (but red sensitive) cones in the fovea.<\/strong>  While using a similar level of rod activation with blue light, you would perceive a \"blind spot\" where your fovea is.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, instrinsically photosensitive cells (the melanopsin cells brought up) do not factor into this processing.  These cells are activated only with extraordinarily bright levels of light, and the therefore do not enter into conversations dealing with night vision.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3471,"question_id":2075,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1347035611},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a99956c7a4006872c9ccefe49c63f108?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4021,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4021/jack","reputation":11,"display_name":"Jack"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b219b646efa3c74061977c39306c1841?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":810,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/810/shep","reputation":1198,"display_name":"Shep","accept_rate":67},"score":0,"post_id":9294,"edited":false,"creation_date":1373935308,"comment_id":12178,"body":"I looked up photochromatic step, but I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for, do you have some link to whatever you&#39;re talking about?"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1373927285,"creation_date":1373927285,"body":"<p>Yes red light is useful IF and only if >650 nm.

Based on the distance between each band and based on the molecular weight, it's possible to know HIV is present or not? <\/p>\n","question_id":9272,"tags":["molecular-biology","virology","sds-page"],"score":0,"accepted_answer_id":9273,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":326,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1373897786},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78fad95c3fbea5f4a17b5cac26468328?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4006,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4006/sebasti%c3%a1n-molina","reputation":113,"display_name":"Sebastián Molina"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"score":0,"post_id":9243,"edited":false,"creation_date":1373636369,"comment_id":12081,"body":"Moore is a human anatomy text and is unlikely to be helpful for Mathematical Biology (but a great book for human anatomy)."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78fad95c3fbea5f4a17b5cac26468328?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4006,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4006/sebasti%c3%a1n-molina","reputation":113,"display_name":"Sebastián Molina"},"score":0,"post_id":9243,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de2c4fd753821f85c74d886aa17410de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/107/kmm","reputation":8486,"display_name":"kmm"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1373640209,"comment_id":12084,"body":"@kmm I don&#39;t know if is necessary to have some anatomy knowledge, because I think that is important to know where are located the parts of human body..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a43651dba3f306d9c0c0b92a7457722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1441,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1441/bitwise","reputation":1705,"display_name":"Bitwise"},"score":0,"post_id":9243,"edited":false,"creation_date":1373756635,"comment_id":12125,"body":"This is highly relevant: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9102/suitable-introductory-book-on-bioinformatics-for-a-computer-scientist\" title=\"suitable introductory book on bioinformatics for a computer scientist\">biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9102/&hellip;<\/a>"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fd0460e6bb88f561fb14814a253a60c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3841,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3841/gaurav-jain","reputation":112,"display_name":"gaurav_jain"},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6de2ee4a7f7e3323daea4eb795260f47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1853,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1853/keegan-keplinger","reputation":688,"display_name":"Keegan Keplinger"},"score":0,"post_id":9245,"edited":false,"creation_date":1373672343,"comment_id":12095,"body":"I have taken Brian Ingalls class.

There's <em>some<\/em> wiggle room depending on epitope length and specificity of the Immune Response (highly specific MHC proteins will invoke a very strong, very <em>efficient<\/em> response - while less specific [usually B-cell or early T-cell responses] will invoke a weaker, less effective response), but because pathogens can mutate so quickly it's not uncommon that you'll encounter a descendant of a virus you already encountered that has dramatically different characteristics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some pathogens are also just very \"clever\" at avoiding the immune system. Sometimes they can produce shells which can't be broken down to derive epitopes from, sometimes they live within host cells and simply hide (the most well known example being HIV), other times they can present the same \"I'm part of the body!\" MHC proteins that tells the immune system not to attack them, and they can even hide in parts of the body where the immune system rarely visits (eyes, brain, other very specialized tissues).<\/p>\n\n<p>And at times the pathogen can be both very adaptive and very \"clever\", as in the case for <em>Staphylococcus aureas<\/em> - which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus\">can inactivate antibodies through surface proteins<\/a> and has the ability to adapt to new antibodies very quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can think of it like a game of chess. If you play against the same person all the time you're going to learn their moves, their strategy, and be able to beat them very quickly. If you switch partners, or your regular partner learns new moves, you'll spend some time adapting to the new play style you've encountered before being able to win consistently again.

A centrifuge has to be perfectly balanced at high speed to stay stable. As an example, one of the table-top centrifuges I use has a steel jacket that's perhaps 1 cm thick or more surrounding the rotor, just in case there is a balance issue or the rotor breaks from mechanical stress. A Google image search for <a href=\"http://google.com/search?q=centrifuge+accident&amp;tbm=isch\" rel=\"nofollow\">centrifuge accident<\/a> shows what mechanical stress can do when an improper rotor was used on a high-speed centrifuge for just a few hours. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum\" rel=\"nofollow\">angular momentum<\/a> increases both with the mass of the object being rotated, and with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia\" rel=\"nofollow\">moment of inertia<\/a>, which increases as the radius of the object being rotated increases. In other words, if you tie a ball to a short piece of string (say 0.5m) and swing it around your head, you can feel a certain amount of force. Take that same ball and tie it to a 2m piece of string, and at the same number of rotations per minute the force will increase substantially. All this means is that as the radius of the rotation increases, the amount of <em>g<\/em> force increases as well, but the stress on the machine also increases, especially if the balance is off.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, good luck with your experiments, just remember that safety always comes first. You can replace samples, and you can replace equipment, but you can't replace you. Even simple precautions like always wearing goggles or protective safety glasses should always be followed.

There is also this statement:    <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"One kilo of <em>E. coli<\/em> yields less than 10 mg of the purified enzyme.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm guessing that you have no experience of protein purification, so I'll just tell you that this is very discouraging: these days, with overexpression, people expect to get mg quantities of their protein from just a few grams of bacterial cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a clear illustration of why it is pretty much unthinkable for you to set out to purify an enzyme like this using small-scale methods, and explains why techniques of overexpression and the use of affinity tags have revolutionised protein purification.<\/p>\n\n<p>And it gets worse: even if you did manage to purify some DNA polymerase I from a bacterial source you would find that it is actually not very good at making DNA. This is because as well as extending primers in a 5'>3' direction, it is is very good at degrading DNA in the same direction. In other words as the enzyme moves along a template molecule, copying it, it will degrade any existing DNA that it meets \"ahead\" of its direction of travel. This is why the most commonly-used form of this enzyme in research is the \"Klenow fragment\", a fragment of the polymerase that lacks the 5'>3' exonuclease activity. This fragment was originally made by treating DNA polymerase I with the protease subtilisin, but it is now expressed from an engineered polA gene. Klenow fragment polymerase was used in the original PCR experiments (it had to be added afresh at every cycle).<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know how much money you have to spend on your projects, but in fact these enzymes can now be bought relatively cheaply.  I don't think that you can expect to make them for yourself, without this becoming the actual project.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you can get hold of a strain of <em>E. coli<\/em> with an expression plasmid for Taq polymerase then you really could make your own very easily - I've done this myself (but I no longer have the strain) and the heat stability of the enzyme makes the purification trivial. It would be much easier to use your own Taq with a heated water bath than to try to make DNA polymerase I. But obviously it depends upon what you are trying to do: Taq polymerase may be unsuitable for other reasons.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9254,"question_id":9242,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9242/preparation-of-normal-dna-polymerase","last_activity_date":1373682207,"creation_date":1373612987,"answer_count":1,"title":"Preparation of normal DNA polymerase","body":"<p>i don't need Taq polymerase.

In fact, the mechanisms behind short-term memory are still under intense debate.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for long-term memory, it is essentially caused by chemical changes in synapses between neurons in the brain. When you sense stimuli from your environment, action potentials follow a specific trail of afferent neurons towards the central nervous system, which then sends a message back through efferent neurons to initiate a response. The high frequency of these action potentials from the same stimuli of whichever sense allows for the strengthening of specific connections between neurons, which is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation\">long-term potentiation<\/a>. This phenomenon is one of the major components of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity\">synaptic plasticity<\/a>, which also applies to the weakening of synaptic connections between neurons due to lack of transmission, as well as the change in the number of connections the neurons are receiving and making. Synaptic plasticity is also influenced by the change in quantities of neurotransmitters being expulsed into the synaptic cleft, and how cells react to these neurotransmitters, which is highly regulated by calcium levels.

That&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to use the quantitative features that lead to describing the leaf&#39;s shape in words (L:W &gt;10 =&gt; &#39;linear&#39; leaf)."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1373438976,"creation_date":1373433695,"body":"<p>Quantitative descriptions of leaf shape used as diagnostics are hard to come by. There are numerous qualitative descriptions (lyrate, cordate, acicular, etc.), and I think this fits within the example you give that \"the laminar shape for this species is mainly ovate.\" But actual quantitative ranges as you mention (e.g., that the L:W ratio of Acer lies within a certain range) are much more difficult to come by. Also, there are ways of quantifying leaves using all the shape variance present in their outlines, and I describe some of these methods below. By using quantitative methods such as these, you can avoid the trap of a subjective criteria that arbitrarily distinguishes leaf morphs by a particular feature. Plus, you won't be biased by using a particular shape attribute, as you will be measuring the entirety of shape. Use of these various methods though depends on the species you are studying.<\/p>\n\n<p>Oreotrephes I think is on track saying that, if possible, you should build your own diagnostic criteria for whatever system you are working in. You mentioned certain \"ranges\" that can diagnose a species ... this is a critical question. Measuring intra-genotype/individual variance in shape for your system is critical. Which leaf to measure for a species? ... i.e., shoot position, developmental age of the leaf, if working with compound leaves, the placement of the leaflet along the proximal distal axis of the leaf, what about heteroblasty (changes in leaf form at different nodes), leaves from lateral vs. main branches, environmental effects on leaves (e.g. sun vs. shade leaves)? <\/p>\n\n<p>For tomato, I measure shape quantitatively using Elliptical Fourier Descriptors, which reduces the shape of an object to a series approximation and explains variance with a Principal Component Analysis. I use the resulting Principal Component values of leaves as a trait and explain shape quantitatively that way. A very useful program to perform Elliptical Fourier Descriptors is described in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/93.5.384\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iwata &amp; Ukai 2002<\/a> and can be downloaded <a href=\"http://lbm.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwata/shape/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. In <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.192518\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chitwood et al 2012<\/a>, I describe how to perform shape analysis on tomato leaves, separating components of shape based on genotype (e.g., by species), by position in the leaf series (heteroblasty), the ontogentic age of the leaf, and placement of leaflets along the proximal-distal axis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other easy ways to measure shape: Circularity, solidity, L:W ratio (or aspect ratio) as you mentioned. All very easy to measure in ImageJ!<\/p>\n\n<p>You mentioned Acer leaves, which piqued my interest because I study differences in the shape of grape leaves. But like grape, many Acer leaves are palmately lobed. If every one of your samples has certain features (e.g. 5 lobes and 5 sinuses as in Acer, including petiolar sinus) then you can perform a landmark analysis using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (The \"Shapes\" package in R is useful for this analysis).<\/p>\n\n<p>Using global methods to describe shape, that is, methods to quantify the totality of shape variance, are critical to distinguish leaves. It may very well be that two leaves are so similar from different species that they are not statistically separable by shape! Be creative in the ways you measure shape, and if need be, create your own system for doing so!<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.192518\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <strong>Chitwood DHD, Headland LRL, Kumar RR, Peng JJ, Maloof JNJ, Sinha NRN<\/strong>. 2012.

Macrophages and neutrophils can release their lytic/degrading enzymes spewing them on to the amoeba. Antibodies produced by BCells, particularly the IgE type can coat amoeba and cause histamine release from mast cells recruiting more neutrophils and macrophages. Eosinophils are also important. Finally one must not forget the complement system, a series of proteins that could kill by making pores in the amoeba membrane.
