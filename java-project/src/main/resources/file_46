The reason that this evaporation causes cooling (explained in more detail <a href=\"http://www.planetseed.com/relatedarticle/evaporative-cooling\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>) is because when water evaporates, that water takes its energy with it. That energy loss to you is in the form of heat, thus making you feel colder.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is a little bit more to it than that. If you look on <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/atmospheric/question70.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">How stuff works - windchill factor<\/a> they go onto to talk about how the process of <a href=\"http://home.howstuffworks.com/thermos1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">convection<\/a> is what makes you feel cooler. What's happening is you're actually warming the air around your body up, and as the wind blows it's wisking that nice warm air away from your body replacing it with much colder air. The faster the wind blows, the faster your warm air is taken away from your body. When the wind blows fast the molecules around you move away from you faster so you have less time to heat them. <\/p>\n\n<p>How Stuff Works says this about convection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Convection - Convection is a property of liquids and gases. It occurs\n  because when a liquid or gas gets hot, it tends to rise above the rest\n  of the body of liquid or gas. So, if you have a hot bowl of soup on\n  the table, it heats a layer of air surrounding the bowl. That layer\n  then rises because it is hotter than the surrounding air. Cold air\n  fills in the space left by the rising hot air. This new cold air then\n  heats up and rises, and the cycle repeats. It is possible to speed up\n  convection -- that is why you blow on hot soup to cool it down.

All this is driven by the entropic benefits of having water molecules in the gaseous state rather than the liquid state.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wind makes the process more efficient because it removes the water-vapor laden air, unbalancing the equilibrium of the process in favor of further evaporation. More water makes it more efficient (to a point), because there's more water to evaporate and the rate of evaporation increases, increasing the removal of heat.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is not just a physiological perception effect - one can actually measure the temperature drop when water evaporates. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler\">Evaporative coolers<\/a> make use of this effect, and traditional wet-bulb hygrometers (psychrometers) use exactly this effect to measure the humidity -- in some cases you can get a temperature differential of 20 °C or more between a dry bulb thermometer and a wet bulb thermometer.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a small perceptual effect in that the evaporative cooling is happening on your skin, where a large number of temperature receptors are located. Therefore, your skin (and temperature receptors) feel a cooling effect even if your core temperature doesn't change detectably.

The cicada uses a resonant organ-system called the <em>tymbal<\/em> which buckles and unbuckles rapidly to produce sound. The buckling-in is caused by muscle contraction and is louder than the buckling-out (relaxation) phase. Air sacs (a feature of many other small noisemakers) serve to amplify the sound.  The tymbal itself, for the species in this paper, has a resonant frequency of about 4kHz (Young, page 1017). The song of the cicada as modified/amplified by air sacs and other structures, is often around 10kHz.$^{2}$<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pure Tone vs. Diffuse Tone?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The vocalizations of large vertebrates are a complex superposition of waves that in the frequency spectrum are somewhat spread out. To the extent that a frog or a bird emits a pure tone, the energy will be confined to a narrow frequency range and this <em>may<\/em> be a strategy for achieving greater amplitude. <em>Given comparable audio sensitivity<\/em>, however, the intensity of pure tones will depend on amplitude (intensity), regardless of frequency.$^{3,4}$ <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Small Loud Animals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>While the songs of cicadas are intense, especially in concert, on an individual level there is competition from other species. According to a <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5811368/animals-most-amazing-acoustic-feats/\">Gizmodo<\/a> article quoting assorted scientists, the snapping shrimp produces a transient snap that is around 200 decibels, a level that <a href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~dnitzer/4HaasEaton/Decibel.html\">one site<\/a> describes as \"deafening.\" For perspective, dolphins can emit short chirps of 220 dB but these are outside the range of human hearing. The lion emits a roar of 115 dB which is sustained and audible 5 miles away, according to the article. Elephants also are capable of 117 dB cries, as are howler monkeys.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both the shrimp and the cicada use non-vocal vibration to create their sounds. The shrimp uses a \"spring-loaded claw\" (the spring is muscle). The localized force of one part of the claw hitting the other generates a bubble (this is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation\">inertial cavitation<\/a>). When the bubble collapses it generates a shock wave (noise) that stuns fish (prey).$^5$ The noise of frogs is produced as air passes from the lungs through the larynx, amplified by distended air sacs which resonate. Birds can produce up to 135dB (the Mollucan Cockatoo). They generally force air past (membranes and) a specialized organ called the <em>syrinx<\/em> located at the bottom of the trachea (see the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization\">Wikipedia<\/a> note on bird vocalization).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Micronecta scholtzi,<\/em> a 2mm-long aquatic insect, is <em>for its size<\/em> the loudest known animal. It creates a sound of 99.2 dB intensity which (despite being largely lost in transition from water to air) is audible to humans ashore. According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronecta_scholtzi\">Wikipedia note<\/a> it creates this sound by \"stridulating a ridge on its penis across corrugations on its abdomen.\" The area involved is about 50$\\mu m$ across. Details of the mechanism are poorly understood. The article's comparison of the sperm whale's 236 (underwater) dB song gives perspective, as a sperm whale can weigh 14 metric tons.      <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A Common Aspect of Sound Intensity: Cavity Resonance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Descriptive studies of sound-creation by small animals (with the possible exception of the snapping shrimp) do not fully explain why a one-gram bug can make a bigger noise than a lion. Purely vocal methods of larger vertebrates produce sustained noise on the order of 100 dB but the non-vocal instruments of smaller creatures are capable of short bursts of amazing intensity.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to generalize but because air sacs are part of many sound-making schemes, <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/cavity.html\">cavity resonance<\/a> probably plays an important role. Like spring-mass systems or RLC circuits, cavities have resonant frequencies at which amplitude of a signal may be increased (the policeman's whistle is a familiar example). Another paper by Bennet-Clark and Young gives a sketch of a theory along these lines. At resonant frequencies the impedance of the instrument falls sharply and instead of being dissipated (generally as heat) the energy emerges as sound.$^6$  <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>$^1$ Bennet-Clark and Young, The Role of the Tymbal in Cicada Sound Production, J. of Experimental Biol. (1995) 198, 1001-1019.<\/p>\n\n<p>$^{2}$ The frequency of cicadas is variable, mostly on the order of 10kHz but occasionally very low (&lt; 1kHz), mostly due to body size. See this <a href=\"http://sci-s03.bacs.uq.edu.au/ins-info/Hab.htm\">article<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>$^3$ Sound--essentially a compression wave--diminishes with distance. So when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure\">Wiki article<\/a> on noise levels compares noise levels it includes the distance from the object. For example, 100 db (comparable to the cicada) is the level of noise associated with a jack-hammer at 1 meter away.<\/p>\n\n<p>$^4$ Audible range for humans is roughly 15 Hz-16000 Hz. As mentioned below, the dolphin can emit very intense high-pitched sounds that we don't hear at all, so the analogy to EM waves (higher frequency = higher energy) doesn't help predict perception.

These mRNAs, that lack stop codon will cause translation to continue into the poly-A tail (it will result in addition of lysines not phenylalanine). Since no stop codon is present, the ribosome remains attached to the mRNA. Under these circumstances, a pathway known as non-stop decay is activated. <\/p>\n\n<p>An important protein in this pathway \u2014 <em>Ski7<\/em> detects a stalled ribosome and initiates the decay process for both the peptide and the mRNA. The poly-lysine tail of the peptide has been shown to fasten the peptide decay process. <\/p>\n\n<p><hr>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CYK20.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In prokaryotes too, the non-stop mutations cause the ribosome to run through the stop codon and to eventually stall. However, there are no poly-A tails and ribsosome recovery pathway is different from that of eukaryotes. An RNA called tmRNA (a hybrid of tRNA and mRNA) binds to the the A-site using its tRNA-like domain. Then the translation proceeds through the mRNA domain of tmRNA (this is called trans-translation) which causes an addition of a peptide tag (that acts like a degradation signal) to the stalled polypeptide and finally leads to ribosome release when the stop codon is reached. <\/p>\n\n<p><hr>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UyPqq.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>References:<\/h1>\n\n<p><strong>Non-stop decay<\/strong>: \n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klauer and van Hoof. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fwrna.1124\" rel=\"nofollow\">Degradation of mRNAs that lack a stop codon: A decade of nonstop progress<\/a>. <em>Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA<\/em>. 2012 Sep-Oct; 3(5): 649\u2013660. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>tmRNA<\/strong>: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jannsen and Hayes. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FB978-0-12-386497-0.00005-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">The tmRNA ribosome rescue system<\/a>. <em>Adv Protein Chem Struct Biol.<\/em> 2012; 86: 151\u2013191.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":35524,"question_id":35509,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1435298396},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8338f9b96b1c61599df745d61145b0c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15878,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15878/243","reputation":959,"display_name":"243"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1435299447,"creation_date":1435299447,"body":"<p>In fact, it is rare that stop codon mutation causes translation of polyA sequence in mammalian cells because you will find another in-frame stop codon downstream.

The chimp-human figure is measuring <em>sequence similarity<\/em> whilst the figure for kin are measuring <em>gene similarity by descent<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This gives two sources of difference in the two numbers: firstly, there is the distinction between sequence similarity and gene similarity. Let us suppose you have a 1000bp gene, which contains or does not contain a single nucleotide polymorphism. These two variants are different alleles so if you're considering gene similarity then you would say these are 100% different but if you're comparing sequence similarity then you would say that there is just a 1bp difference so these are 99.9% similar. This is how chimps can be both so similar to humans and so different - it is not a matter of how many base pairs are different but where those differences are. A single base pair change in a 1000 bp gene can have a dramatic effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the figure for relatedness to your parents/siblings is talking about similarity <em>by descent<\/em>. In fact, your actual gene similarity to your parents is likely to be substantially higher than 50% because your parents are likely to have <em>the same version of many genes<\/em> so which parent you inherit the gene from makes no difference. Additionally, they will also be homozygous for a number of alleles so that you always inherit the same version of this gene from that parent and are thus more related to your siblings than a crude calculation of relatedness would suggest. The 50% figure comes from only considering two genes the same <em>if they come from the same source<\/em>, i.e. similarity by descent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another, perhaps, better way of thinking of this would be: among those genes that exist in different forms in your parents you will share 50% of them with your parents and 50% of them with each of your siblings on average.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a bit of an aside: the figure for similarity between human and chimp DNA you've given is based on crude annealing. So if a highly similar piece of DNA occurs in both human and chimp DNA they will match up but this does not consider how the DNA is arranged within the genome so it actually misses a considerable amount of the variation between organisms.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20056,"question_id":20038,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1406707340},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100006604836854/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":8570,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8570/mattkaeo","reputation":884,"display_name":"mattkaeo"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1406946843,"creation_date":1406946499,"body":"<p>Here's a language metaphor.

In modelling we just use a function that will <strong>mimic<\/strong> this kind of behaviour.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why functions of the form $\\dfrac{X}{K+X}$ ? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In deterministic modelling using differential equations, it would be preferred to use a continuous function (instead of using a piecewise linear function) because:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Numerical integration is better in case of continuous functions<\/li>\n<li>In biochemical systems, operations are always continuous. There is no digital logic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The MM function can actually be derived using an equilibrium or a quasi-steady state approximation (See the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia page<\/a> for the explanation).<\/p>\n\n<p>In the MM function, when $X \\gg K$ then the function is almost 1. This multiplied by the maximum rate constant will give you the max catalytic rate. At $X=0$ the rate will also be equal to zero. Note that in this model the catalytic rate will not indefinitely increase with $X$.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are several functions that have values between 0 and 1 for increasing concentration of the substrate. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_%28biochemistry%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hill function<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\" rel=\"nofollow\">logistic function<\/a> are common examples. However MM is a simpler model. You can always revise your modelling approach when you have better information of the biological system.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now back to your question:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In this model $C$ denotes alcohol concentration $\\alpha$ denotes maximum clearance rate and $\\beta$ denotes half saturation concentration (concentration of alcohol at which the rate of clearance is half the maximum rate). Intuitively you can think about the mechanism like this: rate of clearance of alcohol depends on the level of alcohol i.e. if you have a lot of alcohol the amount of it removed per unit time will be higher. Think of it as water that is pumped through a pipe; more water in the tank will result in higher flow rate. However when the kidney (or pipe) is overloaded or \"clogged\" with an already excess of alcohol then clearance rate would remain the same (the maximum that the kidneys can excrete). <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the amount of alcohol that is introduced in the body, equals the amount of the alcohol that leave the body<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>That is called mass balance which can be summarized as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>Accumulation = Input + Production - (Output + Degradation)<\/p>\n","answer_id":35481,"question_id":35473,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1435151884}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35473/michaelis-menten-equation-type-how-it-is-derived","last_activity_date":1435219411,"creation_date":1435091759,"answer_count":1,"title":"Michaelis-Menten equation type - how it is derived?","body":"<p>Can somebody explain how is the following differential equation found?

You need to break this long molecule down in order to be able to <em>assimilate<\/em> the constitutive <em>nutrients<\/em>. With those nutrients, you can now make up your own DNA. In other words, we need to break the big Lego castle that is food to get the building blocks in order to rebuild a spaceship. Digestion refer to the first process (breaking up the Lego castle). We refer to the part of the metabolism who breaks things down as catabolism and we refer to the part of metabolism that build things up as anabolism. Note that catabolism + anabolism = metabolism.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why do we cook then instead of digesting by ourself<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Digestion takes much energy and require the organism to have the right organs and to have the right matter (enzymes and stuff). We can save up energy (and the other stuff) by digesting the food outside our body. One could say that humans, (just like spiders for example) are performing external digestion.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why cooked food considered nutritious<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Cooked food don't have more nutrients than raw food. It is actually likely that in the process of cooking you would lose some nutrients going in the water that you throw away typically. The big difference is that nutrients in cooked food are easy to assimilate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that in response to the cooking behaviour, human gut has evolved to be shorter than it was in our ancestor.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35495,"question_id":35494,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1435191684}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35494/why-cooked-food-considered-nutritious-if-proteins-decompose-at-much-lower-temper","last_activity_date":1435191684,"creation_date":1435189591,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why cooked food considered nutritious if proteins decompose at much lower temperatures?","body":"<p>Food is cooked/baked at temperatures that are significantly higher than what's considered normal for proteins/amino acids (40&deg;C).

That is, altruism is more likely to evolve if altruists tend to interact with other altruists. As an example, consider a general model of kin selection due to Queller (Queller 1992 \"A general model of kin selection\"). According to this model, relatedness is viewed as the regression coefficient $\\beta_{G'G}$, where $G$ is the individual's frequency of the altruism allele and $G'$ is the average value of $G$ of an individual's neighbors. Queller's definition of relatedness is a measure of positive assortment because, by definition, \n$$\\beta_{G'G} = \\frac{E(G'\\mid G) - E(G')}{G - E(G)}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>If relatedness is positive, if the focal individual is more altruist than average ($G-E(G)&gt;0$), then this individual will tend to interact with individuals that are more altruist than average ($E(G'\\mid G) - E(G')&gt;0$).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, in Taylor's 1992 kin selection model in patch-structured populations with asexual reproduction (\"Altruism in viscous populations\"), relatedness $R$ is defined as the recursion (p. 354):\n$$ R' = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{N-1}{N}s^2R$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of individuals in each patch and $s$ is the probability the offspring will remain on the natal patch (<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35441/altruism-in-viscous-asexual-populations\">link to a question about $s$<\/a>). Here $R$ doesn't seem to be a measure of positive assortment, but simply the chance that two alleles picked <em>at random<\/em> within the patch will be of the same type.<\/p>\n\n<p>On one hand, $R$ in standard models of kin selection (e.g., Queller's) measures positive assortment. On the other hand, Taylor's kin selection model for patch-structured populations $R$ does not seem to measure positive assortment within a group but the chance that two random individuals share the same allele. <\/p>\n\n<p>I tended to think of Queller's model as a general formulation of kin selection (accordingly, Taylor's model would be a particular instance of Queller's model). But, as I tried to explain above, my impression is that Taylor's model is an entirely different way of modeling kin selection ($R$ does not measure positive assortment). Am I missing some connection between Queller's and Taylor's models of kin selection?

It is a form of energy - molecular energy. Basically, heat is the amount of jiggliness of the molecules of a substance or object. When we look at a hot object, it doesn't apear to be moving any more than a cold object, but on a scale much smaller than we can see, it's molecules are moving faster than in a colder object. <a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/thermalP/Lesson-1/What-is-Heat\">Read this<\/a> for more information if you want.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are at least two things going on in muscle contraction (as well as in other metabolic processes) which produce heat. The first is the chemical reaction that powers muscle contraction. You probably don't want to get into great detail, but basically there is a molecule which your cells use to store power, which we abbreviate as ATP. When our muscles use that power, an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction\">exothermic<\/a> chemical reaction occurs that \"burns\" ATP, breaking it into two pieces (ADP and phosphate). That reaction releases energy. Some of that energy is used in the actual movement of the muscle. But some of it just \"jiggles\" the nearby molecules. Again that jiggling is the very definition of heat.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second source of heat is probably much smaller: friction. In short, just about any time <em>anything<\/em> moves, nearby molecules get jiggled some more. Imagine trying to walk through a room packed full of harps. Everywhere you move, some of those strings get plucked and vibrate. It's a little bit like that. When your muscle fibers tighten and flex, they rub past each other and jiggle each others atoms. All of that jiggliness <em>is heat,<\/em> and the jiggling continues until it can transfer to some other medium, as when, <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/sweat.html\">sweat evaporates<\/a> from your skin.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26140,"question_id":26138,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/26138/what-causes-muscles-to-generate-heat-on-contraction","last_activity_date":1435136196,"creation_date":1419350196,"answer_count":2,"title":"What causes muscles to generate heat on contraction?","body":"<p>I'm curious what the exact cause is of dramatic heat generation that comes along with muscle activity.

Sort the cells into single wells so all descendants are clones of the sorted cell and let them grow until they are dense enough to be transferred into a bigger plate (probably 48 or 24 well). Continue this process until you can go into big cell culture flasks or plates and make sure that you freeze away a number of aliquots as a backup if something goes wrong. Expand the cells further until you have enough cells to do an analysis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keratinocytes need some time to get highly proliferative (around a week or so) and if you don't grow them on a layer of feeder cells, usually also need a special conditioned medium. See the references below (if you have trouble accessing the papers, let me know).<\/p>\n\n<p>What often also helps is the use of conditioned media. I know this from other cells in the skin which often don't like to grow (at least not as primary cells) unless you use conditioned media. For this, take of the media from the same sort of cells (here it would be keratinocytes) before it is completely used (typically yellow if the media contains pH indicators), centrifuge it to remove any cell debris and then mix it with fresh media to let your cells grow. You might need to experiment a bit with the mixing ratio between the \"used\" and the fresh media, but 50%:50% is usually a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/labs/belmonte/pubs/2010/2010-184-np.aasen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isolation and cultivation of human keratinocytes  from skin or\nplucked hair for the generation of  induced pluripotent stem cells<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305417992901043\" rel=\"nofollow\">Culture techniques for human keratinocytes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305417993900287\" rel=\"nofollow\">Improvement of human keratinocyte isolation and culture using\nthermolysin<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":35060,"question_id":35059,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1435079018},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8338f9b96b1c61599df745d61145b0c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15878,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15878/243","reputation":959,"display_name":"243"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXPhP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":12923,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12923/alec-djinn","reputation":647,"display_name":"alec_djinn"},"score":0,"post_id":35068,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433921445,"comment_id":56737,"body":"Thank you for the suggestion, I am indeed using hTERT RPE-1, I will try growing them in 1:1 conditioned medium and see.."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433874766,"creation_date":1433863677,"body":"<p>Although I have not yet done, in general, cells are happier in a conditioning medium.

For couples having trouble getting pregnant, most OB-GYNs and/or Reproductive Endocrinologists/Infertility physicians do a semen analysis.

Why? Because there is no point of there being high numbers of sperm, if their motility is poor, because they won't be able to reach the oocyte. There's no point if they can reach an oocyte, if they are poorly shaped and cannot penetrate it.

But what about complexity?<\/p>\n\n<p>First we should define what complexity is: complexity can be defined as number of different cell types that a multicellular organism can produce, with the same genome. Yes complexity does not correlate with genome size. However, it seems to correlate with number of genes. According to Kauffman, the number of cell types i.e. complexity is linearly correlated (direct correlation) with the square root of number of genes. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wy0ZF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Though Kauffman says that complexity increases with DNA content, which is not actually true, it is certainly possible that that complexity is correlated with number of genes. The book is a little old and certainly molecular and cell biology has seen a lot of progress in this time. However, theoretically higher number of distinct genes should produce more complex phenotypes which Kauffman justifies using his NK-model. This assumption has again been <a href=\"http://www.genomebiology.com/2010/11/5/206\" rel=\"nofollow\">disproved<\/a>. The catch would be that exact duplicates/polyploid genes should not be counted as different genes. Moreover metabolic genes should also not be counted (plants/bacteria have a higher number of functional metabolic pathways). Organismal complexity arises because of the complexity of gene regulatory network which in-turn is dependent on the number of regulatory genes. NK model also in a way assumes regulatory genes (i.e. genes that can interact with each other). Surely complexity cannot arise out of nothing. I can't find the data for this at the moment but the theory is quite strongly plausible. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another point I would like to add is that complexity need not only mean spatial complexity. Complexity can also be temporal. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup> Reference:\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart A Kauffman (1993) The Origins of Order, Chapter 12 <\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":35423,"question_id":35415,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1434969338}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35415/is-the-size-of-the-genome-across-species-roughly-the-same","last_activity_date":1434971785,"creation_date":1434914607,"answer_count":3,"title":"Is the size of the genome across species roughly the same?","body":"<p>Chromosome number differs across species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is the amount of DNA comparable between organisms, just being split into smaller chunks in those species with more chromosomes?

Although there is much less of an increase in insulin following the pure-fat versus the pure-sugar meal, you will notice in Figure 1 that the insulin levels following the pure-fat meals (panel A) are higher than the levels during a fast (panel B). So even if high insulin were the only signal for fat storage, your dream of eliminating insulin with a high-fat meal is not realistic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, when a high-fat diet is designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet\">medical purposes<\/a>, a good deal of care is required to avoid significant potential adverse effects. Adequate protein intake is still required, and amino acids from the protein can be converted to glucose. Furthermore, ketoacids are produced when fatty acids from ingested fat are in excess. (As noted in comments, humans do not convert fatty acids to glucose.) Although ketoacids can be excreted in the urine (admittedly, heading toward your goal of not storing all the calories you consume), the net metabolic effect on the body when you excrete ketoacids is increased acidification, which in turn can lead to difficulties with potassium regulation and thus, in severe cases, with heart function. In the extreme if this were continued for a long time, you may face a problem of life-threatening <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis\">ketoacidosis<\/a> as occurs in type-1 diabetics (low/no insulin) whose disease is not being managed.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, your basic idea is similar to the arguments for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet\">low-carbohydrate diets<\/a>. How well they work and, if they do, through what mechanisms are still somewhat controversial, as I understand.

That said, is does cover molecular genetics quite comprehensively; you can&#39;t really go wrong with either book. However, it&#39;s hard to say whether either of these are the best book for you. There&#39;s a difference between molecular genetics and, say, population genetics."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":1,"post_id":35382,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434844906,"comment_id":57606,"body":"Also, if you have no experience with biology at all, you may want to try a more introductory textbook.

Muting themselves would certainly reduce the chances of being caught in the act. For instance, unless you notice by looking, leeches go undetected for long periods because there isn't any obvious sound emanating from them. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, reasoning says - this should be favorable from the point of view of evolution, unless there is a some indispensable purpose served by this sound, which can not be otherwise served. This <a href=\"http://www.mosquitoreviews.com/mosquitoes-buzz-ears.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">page<\/a> seems to suggest that this is so from the point of view of mating. In fact, quoting verbatim:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since female mosquitoes are larger, they flap their wings slower, and males know it. They use the distinctive pitch of the females' buzz to recognize them. Louis M. Roth, who studied yellow fever mosquitoes for the U.S. Army during World War II, noticed that males ignored females whenever the females were quietly resting, but whenever the females were flying, and therefore buzzing, the males wanted to mate with them. The males even wanted to mate with recordings of female mosquitoes or tuning forks that vibrated at the same pitch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But mating signals could also be of other forms, like some chemicals secreted (I envisage something like pheremones).

Like most things in biology, though, it's likely not a perfect linear relationship across species or across a wide range of individual body weights within a particular species. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even the plasma concentrations across individuals within a particular species with the exact (or very close) body weight is still different. In my own experience, when trying to \"normalize\" or \"adjust\" the estimated fat mass based on the leptin concentration there's still a good amount of variability between individuals. The leptin concentrations for a number of individuals at one specific body fat percentage are not identical - which could be due to some error in the measurement, but also due to biologic variability from other sources (for a example of this variability in animals matched for body weight <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16493121\" rel=\"nofollow\">see here<\/a>). This is probably because there are a lot of other modifying factors or variables within the body that can affect leptin concentrations in the plasma (like other hormones or nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract). So yes, these other hormonal and/or nutrient signals probably contribute to the high variance of plasma leptin concentration for individuals with the same fat mass for all of the reasons listed above (I don't have any references that examine this specific question, though).<\/p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge there are no studies that have examined leptin concentrations across multiple species or even within a large cohort of one species.

Each grid cell represents a spatial unit, and that unit can have any number of variables associated with it - e.g. habitat type/subtype, slope/aspect, management status, etc. We are interested in analyzing time since fire (TSF) effects for a species that is fire dependent. We have long-term datasets, but the most complete is simply the TSF at each point at a given point in time. So for example we have a TSF for each cell in each territory each nesting season. Territories are mapped and we can thus describe the TSF for a territory. Now, imagine one territory has a mean (across all cells) TSF of 10, and a St.D. of 0: The whole territory burned 10 years ago. Another has a mean of 10, and a St.D. of 20, thus has a much more varied fire history influencing demography of the species in question. <\/p>\n\n<p>My question is how would you quantify the differences in TSF across these and other territories for each year? Because the means and St.D. will vary greatly, would it be potentially appropriate to use (in a linear model) an interaction between mean and variance as a metric: e.g. Y = mean + StD + mean*StD? Other ideas?<\/p>\n\n<p>Although there may be other data available, assume for the moment that we only have the TSF data.

I then culture these ESCs in the presence of neomycin, which will kill any cells that haven't taken up and incorporated the vector into the genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once I have some cells that I know have taken up the <em>Neo<\/em> part <strong>and<\/strong> are missing the targeted part of the gene (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon\" rel=\"nofollow\">exons<\/a> marked 1, 2, and 3), I inject a few cells each into mouse <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst\" rel=\"nofollow\">blastocysts<\/a>, where they divide and differentiate to form various parts of the new mouse.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JRHig.png\" alt=\"from Wikipedia\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">chimeric<\/a> mouse, with different cells coming from different origins, either wild-type or ABC123-mutant. I try to generate a number of different chimeras to breed together in the hopes that at least some of my original injected mutant cells went on to form the gonads, and the mutant gene can be passed on to its offspring. I then breed the various chimeric mice to WT mates in hopes of producing heterozygous offspring, which have one copy of the WT-ABC123 gene (from one parent), and one copy of the mutant-ABC123 gene (from the other parent). <strong>These<\/strong> mice can then be bred together to produce homozygous \"double-knockout\" mice, which I can then use to study my gene's effects and its possible relation to skin cancer. This is the type of animal typically sold by Jax, although this depends very strongly on the gene being studied.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, there are many issues that can arise along the way, such as the mutation being embryonic-lethal, causing sterility, or other defects that don't allow you to produce true knockout mice. Much can still be learned, though, and scientists have gotten very inventive in producing functional animal models of previously-difficult mutations. For example, it is possible to engineer a strain that only becomes a knockout when you feed it a certain chemical in its water, or is only knocked out in certain cell types or tissues. Some gene functions are only apparent when two (or more!) genes are knocked out at the same time. Genetics is incredibly complex, but fascinating, and more and more complex tools are being developed all the time to assist scientists in their research and ultimately help people overcome illness and disease.<\/p>\n","answer_id":8345,"question_id":8334,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1e14e20d40dc23eb25ad0757471825e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":16300,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16300/todd","reputation":1,"display_name":"Todd"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":35356,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434693459,"comment_id":57496,"body":"How is your information on Aflatoxin relate to the question which is about having a mouse strain that is highly susceptible to cancer.

The TD50 is the chronic dose-rate in mg/kg/day, which causes tumors in half of the population and is a measure of carcinogenic potency. The aflatoxin TD50 in rats is 0.0032 mg/kg/day. Assuming the daily food consumption of rats to be about 10g / 100g, this translates to aflatoxin levels of 32 ppb in the rat diet. Aflatoxin has also been classified as a known human carcinogen, and aflatoxin levels are therefore regulated by the FDA and USDA. Aflatoxin levels in human and pet foods may not exceed 20 ppb, and aflatoxin levels in other animal feeds may not exceed 300 ppb.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rats are the species most sensitive to aflatoxin. Based on epidemiological studies, rats are estimated to be about 10,000 times more sensitive to the effects of aflatoxin than are humans. Thus, the FDA-set maximum allowable level of aflatoxin allowed in human and pet foods, 20 ppb, may not be set low enough to protect rats from the effects of aflatoxin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fumonisin causes liver cancer in rats. The fumonisin TD50 in rats is 1.16 mg/kg/day. Assuming the daily food consumption of rats to be about 10g / 100g, this translates to fumonisin levels of 11.6 ppm in the rat diet. It is unknown if fumonisin is a human carcinogen, and fumonisin levels are therefore not regulated. The FDA has set guidance levels for fumonisin levels in human foods and animal feeds on the order of ppm and 100's of ppm, respectively, but, again, these are only recommended levels and fumonisin levels are not regulated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aflatoxin is a common contaminant of corn and peanuts and their products, and fumonisin is a common contaminant of corn and corn products. In these foods, aflatoxin and fumonisin most likely occur at levels, which are carcinogenic to rats; so feeding a daily diet, which consisted only of these foods, would result in liver, kidney, and colon tumors in many of the rats. Feeding a daily diet limited in corn and peanuts and their products reduces aflatoxin and fumonisin levels and reduces associated tumor risks.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<p>Action Levels for Aflatoxins\n<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgvet/cpg683-100.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgvet/cpg683-100.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB)\n<a href=\"http://potency.berkeley.edu/cpdb.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://potency.berkeley.edu/cpdb.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I will offer more soon.

Additionally, a 2M+ peak of about 20% abundance at 76,759 m/z corresponds well with the predicted mass of the dimeric form of the enzyme (76,762 Da).\"<\/p>\n","answer_id":35299,"question_id":35296,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35296/how-is-the-subunit-molecular-weight-different-from-the-native-molecular-weight","last_activity_date":1434638812,"creation_date":1434562526,"answer_count":1,"title":"How is the subunit molecular weight different from the native molecular weight?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1065158/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I noticed that the native molecular weight for an enzyme is different from its subunit molecular weight.<\/a> Why are they different?

Diet restriction for example has been shown to extend life span of worms and mice. Temperature is also working well, at least with microorganisms, the metabolism of E.coli for example (that usually grows at 37 Celsius) can be greatly slowed down at lower temperatures. Also, there are enzymes involved in the \"ageing pathway\" some of these enzymes can be promoted or repressed by small molecules, like resveratrol does, and as result you get some increment in life span. The opposite is also true, you can accelerate ageing with external factors. For plants works as well, changing the environment you can definitely have an effect on the life span and the overall metabolism rate, indeed tricking the light cycle is a very well known method to induce flowering for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here some interesting links if you wanna dig more into this topic.\n<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/biology/guarente/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.mit.edu/biology/guarente/<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/sinclair/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/sinclair/<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_kenyon_experiments_that_hint_of_longer_lives?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_kenyon_experiments_that_hint_of_longer_lives?language=en<\/a>\n<a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/12/3099.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/12/3099.full<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":35317,"question_id":35316,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1434630245},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":35318,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434616005,"comment_id":57381,"body":"Quite some experiments like this have been done with <i>C.elegans<\/i>, also."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ileL3.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15051,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15051/florion","reputation":670,"display_name":"FloriOn","accept_rate":75},"score":1,"post_id":35318,"edited":false,"creation_date":1434617608,"comment_id":57383,"body":"That&#39;s not actually the same thing I&#39;m interested in.

You mention a huge number of processes, which will also interact with eachother. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, taking a general view, life span and generation time can definitely be increased. Changes in temperature and nutrition will often change the metabolic rates and growth rate of organisms, but the actual effect will depend on which organism you are looking at. For instance, the length of the larval stage of many longhorn beetles can increase by several years in colder climates or site conditions, under shorter growing seasons and/or poor wood substrates, compared to ideal conditions or warmer microclimates. The mechanism here is often lower activity levels or lower nutrient contents, leading to lower growth rates, which means that it will take more time before the larvae reaches maturity. This means that individuals of the same species (also the same genotype) may have a life span of 6 years in one location and 2 ys in another location. This is just a single example, and lots of similar processes can also be found in other organism groups, especially considering the large number of factors that you mention in your question.<\/p>\n\n<h3>References:<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bilý, S. &amp; Mehl, O. 1989.
