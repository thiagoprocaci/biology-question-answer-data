I guess the origin of this kind of claim is a bad press release or something.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's start with something simple. Say hearing. When you hear a sound to your left ear, it is projected strongly to the contra-lateral side (right hemisphere), and weakly to the ipsi-lateral (left hemisphere) of your brain. So the brain response to a sound presented to the left ear is <em>lateralized<\/em>. Typically, this means that the other hemisphere is \"more\" responsible for processing the input. Similar thing happens for the other senses too.<\/p>\n\n<p>So what is interesting about lateralized brain responses? Well, it would be very interesting to know for example are memories lateralized. It would tell something about the system: is it a kind of distributed system, where parts of a memory are scattered here and there, according to some logic, or is a single memory stored on a small area (and maybe only on the other side of the brain), etc. The distributed hypothesis seems more plausible according to recent research.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's talk about handedness next. Are you right handed? Or left handed? Or ... something between? Actually, even something like handedness is not a binary thing. It is more like a value on a range from 0 (\"very left handed\") to 100 (\"very right handed\"). This is taken into account in decent research, where ~1 hr per participant is used to assess that value (if it is relevant to the study).<\/p>\n\n<p>So we have now talked about lateralization. How about the \"left and right brained behaviour\" then? In the URL you have provided it is implied that certain behavioural attributes are somehow related to lateralization. Lateralization of what? All the attributes, e.g. \"being rational\" depend on so many things: seeing, hearing, thinking, retrieving memories, ... that saying such a thing is not plausible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, many brain processes are lateralized. That is the word to look up for for more information. But a thing like \"behaviour\" is too complex to be put to one hemisphere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reference: Accumulated wisdom from being a research assistant in a neuroscience project.

As a result the root (newest part of the hair) will typically be gray when they have mostly all died off, the middle will have a bit of melanin because it was produced when there were still some functional melanocytes, and the tip (the oldest part of the hair) will still be full of melanin from when it was produced when the melanocytes were alive.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for why this happens it's not fully understood why the melanocytes die as we age, but the gene Bcl-2 has been found to be essential for the maintenance of melanocytes.

The make the pigment (eumelanin=dark and pheomelanin=red/yellowish) which is then deposited into the growing hair. They are located at the bottom of hair bulb and usually die at the end of each hair cycle. To have the hair of the next hair cycle colored as well, this melanocyte population in the hair bulb needs to be replenished. This is done by melanocate stem cells, which live in the hair bulge and which start to reproduce and differentiate in melanocyte which then migrate down to the hair bulb. There is an excellent article following this process:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618488\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechanisms of hair graying: incomplete melanocyte stem cell\nmaintenance in the niche.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The hair later gets grey (low pigment) and white (no pigment) when these melanocytes are not, or not fulley replenished in later hair cycles.

The aim of this article is to make sense of and evaluate this claim. In Section 2, I flesh out the argument that humans are \u2018insulated\u2019 from ordinary evolutionary mechanisms in terms of our contemporary biological understandings of phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, and cultural transmission. In Section 3, I consider two obvious objections to the above argument based on the growing literatures related to gene-culture coevolution and recent positive selection on the human genome, as well as a pair of less common objections relating to the connection between plasticity, population size and evolvability. In Section 4, I argue that both the \u2018human evolutionary stasis argument\u2019 and its various detractor theories are premised on a fundamental conceptual flaw: they take evolutionary stasis for granted, since they fail to conceive of stabilizing selection as a type of evolution and drift as a universal tendency that dominates in the absence of selection. Without the continued operation of natural selection, the very properties that are purported to reduce the evolutionary response to selection in humans would themselves drift into non-functionality. I conclude that properly conceived, biological evolution is a permanent and ineradicable fixture of any species, including Homo sapiens.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276617/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Keightley. 2012.

Positive selection on male wealth appears to be a recurrent feature of human agrarian and pastoralist societies, and there is some evidence of it in industrial populations, too. Here we investigate the strength of selection on male wealth, first in contemporary Britain using data from the National Child Development Study and then across seven other varied human societies. The British data show positive selection on male income driven by increased childlessness among low\u2010income men but a negative association between personal income and reproductive success for women. Across cultures, selection gradients for male wealth are weakest in industrial countries and strongest in subsistence societies with extensive polygyny. Even the weakest selection gradients observed for male wealth in humans are as strong as or stronger than selection gradients reported from field studies of other species. Thus, selection on male wealth in contemporary humans appears to be ubiquitous and substantial in strength.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":9764,"question_id":9739,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1413192534},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8ac30c9dc7eb4a49374189ee91d4301?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9612,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9612/techzen","reputation":191,"display_name":"TechZen"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1413095866,"creation_date":1413095866,"body":"<p>You can't predict the evolution of anything because evolution is driven solely by the environment.

When the cysteine concentration in the cell is high, the pathway goes exclusively into the direction of pheomelanin, only when the cyteine concentration is lower than 0,76µM eumelanin is made (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12950725\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18435614\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for details).<\/p>\n\n<p>But this is not the only influence on the reaction.

The relevant equation is:<\/p>\n\n<p>$(1)\\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta n(1-q)I-\\mu I$ where:<\/p>\n\n<p>$n$ = the population density. Let us measure it in units of $km^{-2}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>$I$ = the density of already infected individuals in the population; measured in the\nsame units as $n$.<\/p>\n\n<p>$q$ = the fraction of the population that is immune to the disease, either naturally of\ndue to vaccination. Consequently, $1-q$ is the fraction of the population that is\nsusceptible, i.e., at risk of getting infected. $q$ is a pure number between $0$ and $1$,\nand has no units.<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\beta$ = is the transmission rate of the disease. It measures how easily and quickly\nthe disease can be transmitted from an infected individual to an non-infected\nsusceptible individual. $\\beta$ includes within it both the rate at which encounter\nbetween infected and non-infected individuals occur, and the probability that\nsuch an encounter would result in actual transmission of the disease. $\\beta$ has\ndimensions of $\\frac{1}{time\\times density^{2}}$, so let us measure it in units of $week^{-1}km^{4}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\mu$ = the rate at which infected individuals are eliminated from the group of\ninfected individual, either because they recover, or because they die. $\\frac{1}{\\mu}$ is the average duration of the infection, i.e., the average time that an individual remains\ninfected before it either recovers or dies. Let us measure $\\mu$ in units of $week^{-1}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>This equation derives from the differential equation $(2) \\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$ where $r$ is called instantaneous rate of increase. It is easy to see that $I$ from equation $(1)$ is equivalent to $N$ from equation $(2)$ and therefore, $r$ for equation $(1)$ will be $(3) r=\\beta n(1-q)-\\mu$. When we look at equation $(3)$, we see two factors:<\/p>\n\n<p>$\\beta n(1-q)$ - A positive factor(ii)\n$\\mu$ - A negative factor<\/p>\n\n<p>Minding the above, when $r=0$, there is no increase in population(iii). From this, we can compute $q_{0}$ which is the minimum fraction of vaccinated/immune individuals in the population that is required in order to prevent the disease from spreading. From equation $(3)$ we can figure out that $q_{0}=1-\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta n}$. Just as $q$, $q_{0}$ is a pure number between $0$ and $1$.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Welcome to the desert of the real (my question)<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose we compare two countries with the following data:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Israel: $n=347km^{-2}$, $\\beta=0.0015week^{-1}km^{4}$, $\\mu=0.25week^{-1}$<\/li>\n<li>Finland: $n=16km^{-2}$, $\\beta=0.0015week^{-1}km^{4}$, $\\mu=0.25week^{-1}$<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>When we look for $q_{0}$ for Israel we see that $q_{0}(Israel)=1-\\frac{0.25}{0.0015\\times347}=0.52=52$% while for Finland we see that $q_{0}(Finland)=1-\\frac{0.25}{0.0015\\times16}=-9.42=-942$%.

The initiation of the reflex arc is determined at the level of the nociceptors (pain-transducing receptors) in the epidermis. For the most part, these are part of \u201cfree\u201d (not encapsulated) nerve endings of sensory fibers. These fibers course within spinal nerves whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia adjacent to the spinal cord. There are two types of nociceptive endings:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mechanical: with parent fibers Aδ\n<ul>\n<li>transduce severe mechanical deformation   <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>polymodal: with parent C-fiber units\n<ul>\n<li>transduce heat, cold, irritant signals<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This picture shows free nerve endings in the epidermis. The boxed portion of the big picture is expanded in the bottom right.  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/08K7V.png\" alt=\"free nerve endings\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The withdrawal reflex initiated by these receptors is mediated by a polysnaptic (multiple neurons) arc. The sensory neuron synapses with interneurons in the spinal cord.<sup>1<\/sup> Some of these use glutamatergic connections to activate appropriate muscle groups mediating withdrawal. Others inhibit the reciprocal muscle groups (<em>reciprocal inhibition<\/em>) to allow this movement to be unimpeded. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a cartoon diagram showing the spinal components of the reflex arc in a cross-sectional level of the spinal cord. Notice the interneuron between the sensory and motor neurons (although it's not labeled as such here):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZnAn6.png\" alt=\"reflex arc\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Stretch reflex<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In order to provide a broader picture of the basic principles involved in spinal reflexes, it's helpful to also mention the stretch reflex. This is perhaps the quintessential reflex arc because it is monosynaptic, exemplified by the patellar tendon reflex. The stretch reflex is fast, with a latency (stimulus\u2013response interval) of about 15\u201325 ms (contrast the polysynaptic withdrawal reflex with <a href=\"http://f1000research.com/articles/2-158/v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">latency ~70-100 ms<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The stretch is initiated at the Golgi tendon organs. These are found at the junction between muscle and tendon. The (Ib) nerve fiber splays out and intertwines with tendon fiber bundles. The  nerve endings are activated by the tension of muscle contraction (either passive (as when the patellar tendon is tapped), or active (as during voluntary movement). The afferent sensory neurons directly excite homonymous motor neurons  (i.e. motor neurons supplying the same muscles), and inhibit (via interposed \u201cIa internuncials\u201d) the antagonist muscles.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have limited the discussion here to the withdrawal reflex you asked about and another basic spinal reflex arc as an illustration of principle. There are many other, mostly more complex reflex arcs that are beyond the scope of this answer, but I highly recommend checking out a neuroanatomy or neurophysiology textbook such as the one I've listed below if you'd like more information.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>\n<strong>Note<\/strong>\n<\/sup>\n<sup><br>\n1. Although the discussion here is limited to the anatomy of the reflex arc, there are additional synapses within the spinal cord that connect with ascending circuits, as described in the section about afferent neurons of spinal nerves <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/21289/9268\">in another answer<\/a>. Some of these tracts end up at the cortex and are the basis for conscious perception. However, note that this process is multisynaptic and takes longer. The beauty of the spinal reflex arc is that it does not require information to travel all the way up to the brain and back down, which would slow down the response considerably. Practically, this means that you will pull your hand away from a hot stove before you have conscious sensory awareness of the burn.\n<\/sup>\n<br/><br>\n<sup>\n<strong>Reference<\/strong>\n<\/sup><br>\n<sup>\nApart from linked article and images with sources below, all information is summarized from:\n<\/sup><br>\n<sup>\nMJ Turlough FitzGerald,  Gregory Gruener, Estomih Mtui. <em>Clinical Neuroanatomy &amp; Neuroscience<\/em> © 2012, Elsevier Limited. \n<\/sup><br>\n<sup><br>\nImage 1 from: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_nerve_ending\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_nerve_ending<\/a>\n<\/sup><br>\n<sup>\nImage 2 from: <a href=\"http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/nervous-coordination/natural-reflex.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/nervous-coordination/natural-reflex.php<\/a>\n<\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":23269,"question_id":23266,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1413787535}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23266/what-is-the-mechanism-of-reflex-arcs","last_activity_date":1413787535,"creation_date":1413640597,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the mechanism of reflex arcs?","body":"<p>When a reflex arc occurs the signal from the receptor passes straight to the motor neuron instead of being passed onto the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a rather simplistic explanation, I was hoping to make it more detailed.

This means that it cannot directly determine which base to incorporate at a specific point (how would it 'know' which base to incorporate and how it would it change its specificity for different bases). This means that the specificity for which base pair to incorporate is dependent on the template DNA strand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Correct Watson-Crick base pairing (that is, hydrogen bonding) between the template strand and the nucleotide to be incorporated triggers the closing of the finger domain of DNAP around the primer-template junction and positions the latter in the optimal position for catalysis (with the $\\ce{\\alpha-PO_4}$ of the incoming nucleotide near the $\\ce{3'-OH}$ of the primer for a nucleophilic attack catalysed by two $\\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ ions). This is where the conserved tyrosine residue you mentioned comes into play. An incorrectly paired nucleotide will not trigger this conformational change and will not be positioned optimally, thus catalysis is less likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the DNA polymerase makes contacts with the minor groove of the primer-template junction through hydrogen bonds. This interaction is not base-specific (all Watson-Crick base pairs have he same pattern of hydrogen-bond acceptors in the minor groove) but only occurs when the correct nucleotide is incorporated, thus stabilising the complex. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, discrimination between ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides is done by steric exclusion of the $\\ce{2'-OH}$ by amino acid residues in the binding pocket.<\/p>\n\n<p>These factors can be thought of as kinetic proofreading as they simply slow down the reaction rate and provide time for an incorrectly paired nucleotide to dissociate. However, they can still be incorporated and many DNA polymerases have a $\\ce{3'-&gt;5'}$ proofreading exonuclease that can remove incorrectly paired nucleotides. This proofreading is again mediated by interactions between the DNAP and the primer-template junction (ie hydrogen bonding with the minor groove). A weakened interaction due to an incorrectly paired base reduces the affinity between DNA and the catalytic site and increases the affinity between DNA and the proofreading site (because it has a preference for cleaving ssDNA from the 3' end).<\/p>\n","answer_id":23255,"question_id":23243,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23243/how-does-high-fidelity-of-dna-replication-depend-on-the-formation-of-hydrogen-bo","last_activity_date":1413786099,"creation_date":1413555382,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does high-fidelity of DNA replication depend on the formation of hydrogen bonds?","body":"<p>Replication has an error rate of less than 1 in 100 million.

These function of these proteins depends on Calcium<sup>2+<\/sup> ions, so EDTA will chelate them and make them unavailable. First remove the culture media, rinse the cells with warm PBS to get rid of most ions and then incubate them for 5 min (the time needs to be optimized for each cells line) in PBS with 10mM EDTA in it. The cells either detach themself, can be washed of the surface with a pipette or can be gently knocked off the surface (this works only in tightly closing flasks). Centrifuge the cells shortly to pellet them and get rid of the PBS/EDTA and take them up in fresh medium.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Wash cells of the surface:<\/strong> Some cell lines are so loosely attached (which makes working with them pretty hard), that they can simply be washed off the surface. To do so, use the pipetboy to get some medium and then pump it out again against the cell layer. You can see the cells disappearing from the surface and the medium (or the PBS) get more cloudy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Knock off cells:<\/strong> To do so, you take the flask with medium in one hand and knock it gently 4 or 5 times against the palm of the other hand.

It is called \"non-homologous\" because it does not use a \"homologous\" template from another sequence-matching piece of DNA to guide the repair. Homologous repairs avoid causing mutations because the similar string of DNA  acts as a template so that the cell knows what letters to put into the gap. When there's no template, there's no way for the repair machinery to know what specific letters to use...hence the mutations in NHEJ.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, this NHEJ phenomenon is used to drive the current state-of-the-art in genetic engineering: CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-guided endonucleases. If you cause a double-strand DNA break near the beginning of the protein-coding sequence of a gene, this break will be repaired with NHEJ, causing an \"indel\" (insertion or deletion) mutation to occur. Inserting or deleting letters into the coding sequence of a gene will cause a \"frame shift\" where the 3-letter codons which tell the cell which amino acids to use get all jumbled up because the normal 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 pattern is disturbed. In this way, we can turn off genes that we want to target: just cause a frameshift in that gene with CRISPR.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we want to INSERT something using genome editing, we need \"homology directed repair\" -- we'll give the CRISPR alongside another string of nucleotides which matches the strings that flank the place we are cutting, with a new sequence in the middle. So when CRISPR makes the cut, our homologous template will stick to the sides of the cut and the center piece will provide the cell with a blueprint for the insertion or edit we want to make.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you'll see as you think about it that the \"homology\" which is missing from NHEJ is the strand used as a repair template, and by manipulating these natural DNA repair processes which may or may not use homologous templates, we have a possible method to turn on, turn off, edit or insert genes. This means NHEJ isn't just a biological process anymore: it is an engineering technique.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23287,"question_id":23283,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":4,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1413710073,"creation_date":1413710073,"body":"<p>Non-homologous end joining indeed induces errors in the affected sequence.

It is very important to recognize that the electrochemical potential is not the same as the electric potential. It has a chemical component, so the result will depend on both charge and concentration gradients. By a single ion channel system (e.g. Na\u207a channel only) you can count the potential of each side of the membrane using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation\">Nernst equation<\/a>, by a system with multiple ion channels it is more complicated, so in that case you have to use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_equation\">Goldman equation<\/a>. So at the end you can say something like one side has a potential of <strong><em>x[mV]<\/em><\/strong> and the other side has a potential of <strong><em>y[mV]<\/em><\/strong> and so the difference is:  <strong><em>d[mV] = x[mV] - y[mV]<\/em><\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>The sign of <strong><em>d<\/em><\/strong> depends on <strong><em>x<\/em><\/strong> or <strong><em>y<\/em><\/strong> has a greater value. By single ion channel systems this expresses an <strong><em>x → y<\/em><\/strong> direction so by positive <strong>d<\/strong> the cation flow direction is <strong><em>x → y<\/em><\/strong> and by negative <strong><em>d<\/em><\/strong> it is <strong><em>y → x<\/em><\/strong>. By anion flow it is the opposite.<\/p>\n\n<p>By cells we use the <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> direction by counting the membrane potential. We can count the potentials using the <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nernst equation:\n$$E_m = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\times ln \\left(\\frac{c_{out}}{c_{in}}\\right)$$ or the <\/li>\n<li><p>Goldman equation: \n$$E_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\times ln \\left(\\frac{p_{K^+}.[K^+]_{out} + p_{Na^+}.[Na^+]_{out} + p_{Cl^-}.[Cl^-]_{in}} {p_{K^+}.[K^+]_{in} + p_{Na^+}.[Na^+]_{in} + p_{Cl^-}.[Cl^-]_{out}}\\right)$$\nwhere  <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$Em$ is the membrane potential<\/li>\n<li>$z$ is the ion charge<\/li>\n<li>$[X]$ is the ion concentration<\/li>\n<li>$p_X$ is the relative membrane permeability for the actual ion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>and so on...<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So for example by an average human cell in blood plasma, assuming that the inside of the membrane has a small negative charge<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong><em>Na\u207a<\/em><\/strong> has a positive effect (positive charge, high <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> concentration gradient, low <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> charge gradient),<\/li>\n<li>the <strong><em>K\u207a<\/em><\/strong> has a negative effect (positive charge, high <strong><em>in → out<\/em><\/strong> concentration gradient, low <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> charge gradient),<\/li>\n<li>the <strong><em>Cl¯<\/em><\/strong> has a negative effect (negative charge, high <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> concentration gradient, low <strong><em>in → out<\/em><\/strong> charge gradient)<\/li>\n<li>the <strong><em>Mg\u207a\u207a<\/em><\/strong> has a small positive effect (positive charge, low <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> concentration gradient, low <strong><em>out → in<\/em><\/strong> charge gradient)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>on the membrane potential.

The selective COX-2 inhibitors do not affect platelet\n  function at their usual doses.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase the\n  incidence of edema and hypertension.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>To varying degrees, all newer NSAIDs are analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic, and all (except the COX-2- selective\n  agents and the nonacetylated salicylates) inhibit platelet\n  aggregation. NSAIDs are all gastric irritants and can be associated\n  with gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds as well, although as a group\n  the newer agents tend to cause less gas- trointestinal irritation than\n  aspirin.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, there must be differences to which these drugs manipulate/inhibit the enzymes.\nPlease, see<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Selinsky BS, Gupta K, Sharkey CT, Loll PJ.

On this basis,\n  highly selective COX-2 inhibitors have been developed and marketed on\n  the assumption that such selective inhibitors would be safer than\n  nonselective COX-1 inhibitors but without loss of efficacy.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Inflammatory processes are expressed by both COX-1 and COX-2 differently. \nThis means that a change in the cell membrane expresses lysosomal enzymes differently:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The cell damage associated with inflammation acts on cell membranes to\n  cause leukocytes to release lysosomal enzymes; arachidonic acid is\n  then liberated from precursor compounds, and various eicosanoids are\n  synthesized.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway of arachidonate metabolism produces prostaglandins, which have a variety of effects on blood vessels, on nerve endings, and on cells involved in inflammation.

Human pathogenic bacteria, viz., Enterobacter aerogenes,\n  Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, were selected for the study.\n  All three alkaloids inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus.\n  However, no significant activity was observed against E. aerogenes.\n  Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal\n  concentration were also evaluated.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2009 - <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786410802267692#.VEHfhxaWdqQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biological activity of alkaloids from Solanum dulcamara L.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The glycoalkaloid content usually decrease by ripening, so that the animals can eat them safely and deliver the seeds.

Raw or cooked potato samples (2 g) were extracted twice\n  with 5% acetic acid solution. The extract was purified on Sep-Pak C18\n  and CHA and SOL contents were determined by HPLC. Recoveries of CHA\n  and SOL from raw potatoes were 96.5 and 98.2%, respectively, vs. 96.2\n  and 96.7% from cooked potatoes. >93.9% of CHA and 95.9% of SOL\n  remained in potatoes after boiling. Contents of both were reduced by\n  15% on microwave treatment. On deep-frying alkaloid contents varied\n  according to temperature. At 157°C, both alkaloids were unaffected; at\n  170°, potatoes showed a large variation in residual alkaloids. At\n  210°, alkaloids were partially decomposed; after 10 min heating, 64.9%\n  of CHA and 59.7% of SOL remained. It is suggested that the critical\n  temperature for decomposition of both alkaloids in potatoes may be\n  around 170°. Results confirmed the relatively high stability of CHA\n  and SOL in potatoes under normal home cooking conditions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1990 - <a href=\"http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19920754606.html;jsessionid=907C291A43003744E417CC3E0DF80AA4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effect of cooking on contents of α-chaconine and α-solanine in potatoes.<\/a> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Deep frying over 200 °C might help, because it degrades the glycoalkaloids and probably moves them from the fruits to the oil, but be aware that this is an old article...

If so, then you are correct. The spread primary feathers of soaring birds like eagles function as winglets <a href=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/180/1/285.full.pdf\">(Tucker 1993<\/a>). Airbus has a <a href=\"http://www.airbus.com/innovation/eco-efficiency/design/biomimicry/\">biomimicry web page<\/a> devoted to some of the biological designs, including winglets, they incorporated into their airplane designs. Some studies suggest airplant winglets do increase efficiency (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.waset.org/publications/5593\">Hossain et al. 2011<\/a>), but there is still <a href=\"http://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/8557\">some debate<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/8554\">aviation.se answer<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Look at birds: They use two different wingtip designs. I guess we will both agree that those designs are mature after millions of years of evolution. And still there are two distinct wing tip shapes: One is the \"fingered\" wingtip with large, spread-out feathers, and one is the pointed tip you find from seagulls to albatrosses. Why is there not one, mature design?<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This has to do with the environment they are used in. Seabirds fly in an unobstructed environment with steady winds and need to stay aloft for longer duration. All other birds have to cope with trees obstructing a straight flight path and gusts from hills, or those trees. They need to maneuver quickly and cope with gusty winds. This is helped by a reduced span and the possibility to fold the outer wing in or fan it out in an instance. Hence the fingered wingtip.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Although bird wings do tend to match his descriptions, he is not correct that these correspond entirely to ocean-going birds vs all other birds. Many inland birds have pointed wings, including <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Barn_Swallow_(Hirundo_rustica)_(13).JPG\">swallows<\/a>, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Chordeiles_minorEJN31CB.jpg\">nightjars<\/a>, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Tachymarptis_melba_-Barcelona,_Spain_-flying-8.jpg\">swifts<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Falco_peregrinus_-Morro_Rock,_Morro_Bay,_California,_USA_-flying-8.jpg\">falcons<\/a>.  Some seagoing birds have winglets, such as <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Brown_pelican_-_natures_pics.jpg\">pelicans<\/a> and <a href=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3172/2903748194_1c9f3aa8e8_z.jpg?zz=1\">cormorants<\/a>.  While wing type is shaped by natural selection in a given environment, it also reflects the evolutionary history of the birds. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is not \"one, mature design\" because wings many different shapes and sizeshave evolved under varying selective pressures. For example, the long pointed wings of ocean-going albatrosses are excellent for gliding with little energy expenditure but they are lousy for taking flight or for landing. Other wings are shorter and broader, providing greater maneuverability in the woods. In this sense, there is no perfect wing. Each has evolved for different evolutionary reasons. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The main question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>From the aviation.SE thread:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the fact that no random mutation has produced a winglet* in birds is in no way a demonstration that airplanes do not benefit from them, there is no logical relationship. [*even though the \"fanned\" design you refer, such as the eagle's, can be considered a form of optimum winglet] \u2013  Federico <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>followed by this response:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So you consider evolved wings as not mature. The winglet modification is just waiting to happen? Nature never tried it, in >100 million years of biological flight? Could be, yes. But is extremely unlikely. That settles it for me...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Federico is correct. The basic wing type was set long ago as birds evolved from <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_06\">non-avian dinosaurs<\/a>. Comparisons of modern bird wings with fossils suggest that the basic structure of bird wings has not changed very much since then. The current structure may be the best that has evolved by natural selection so far but that does not mean the wing cannot be improved further. As you noted, mutations could occur in existing genes that lead to further improvements of the structure and function of the wings. If those mutations never occur, then the improvements won't occur. This is one constraint of the evolutionary process <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s3_10100.pdf\">(Hoffman 2014)<\/a>. Natural selection can only work with existing traits, using existing genes and genetic variation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another consideration is that wings for powered flight have evolved independently at least four times (birds, bats, insects, pterosaurs). Each time, a different type of wing evolved. Is one better than another? Bat wings have aerodynamic properties very different from birds but function very well for bats <a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/res77pzy/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/hjs_bb_09.pdf\">(Hedenstrom et al. 2009)<\/a>. Along the lines of your argument above, each wing type perhaps is (or was for pterosaurs) optimum given the environmental circumstances and evolutionary constraints. That doesn't mean they could not be improved.  If a wing evolves again in some organismal group in the distant evolutionary future, odds are very good that the structure will be different from those that have evolved so far. Perhaps that wing will be even more efficient than current wings.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Spandrels<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another user cited the \"Spandrels\" in comparison to the above debate, could someone explain what could have been the meaning of the comparison?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The use of \"spandrels\" in evolutionary biology stems back to a well-known paper by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin called \"The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: a critique of the adaptionist programme\", published in 1979 <a href=\"http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/biol483/articles/Gould%20and%20Lewontin%201979.pdf\">(Gould and Lewontin 1979)<\/a>. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel\">spandrel<\/a> is the space that forms between two adjacent arches or between an arch and a rectangular shape.  The spandrel emerges as a result of putting two arches next to each other and filling the space. It <em>results<\/em> from the joining of two arches. It was not specifically <em>designed<\/em> as part of the arch. Gould and Lewontin claim that evolutionary biologists are too quick to assign adaptive value to every trait on an organism, and argue that not every trait results directly from adaptation. Instead, they say, the trait may be a \"spandrel\" that emerged as a by-product of other traits. The \"spandrel trait\" has no adaptive value in and of itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of spandrels in the comments of the aviation discussion is not clear to me. Clearly, the person intended the evolutionary meaning, mentioning the paper by name. But I cannot tell at all the person's intent.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edits:<\/strong> Incorporated comments by @Federico and @Andrew - thanks.

Yepp wikipedia writes the same <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Membrane potential is a very important thing, because human cells require stable internal concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc... in order to work properly. These concentration can depend on species, for example plants cells work completely different than animal cells, they have higher Na+ than K+ in their cytoplasm. So every human cell has to maintain a membrane potential if they don't want to die. It requires a lot of ATP (energy) to do so... Human cells typically maintain this potential against the blood plasma. Cytoplasm has around 120mM K+ and 15mM Na+, while the blood plasma has about 5mM K+ and 140mM Na+. You can count the membrane potential from these concentrations using the Nernst equation (a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Gr_tmShm4\" rel=\"nofollow\">short presentation about how<\/a>). I don't remember the exact mV value, does not matter. So human cells are working hardly on keeping the Na+ outside and K+ inside, and they can possibly die because of membrane potential changes (e.g. when they require too much energy to maintain the internal concentrations and/or osmolarity).<\/p>\n\n<p>Excitable cells, e.g. nerve cells or muscle cells are very special because they can change their membrane potential rapidly by sending out K+, Ca+ or sending in Na+. This can create small electric discharges, which can be used to send electric signals or contract muscles, etc... Different cells have different discharge diagrams, e.g. axons have something like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SqhP.gif\" alt=\"axon electric discharge diagram\"><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Figure 1 - axon electric discharge diagram - <a href=\"http://mcat-review.org/specialized-eukaryotic-cells-tissues.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>and muscles have something like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bJFKl.jpg\" alt=\"muscle discharge diagrams\"><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Figure 2 - muscle electric discharge diagrams - <a href=\"http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@7.1:127/Anatomy_&amp;_Physiology\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Summa summarum it can depend on the cell type what happens, but basicly you can count the new potential using the Nernst equation by the concentration changes you mentioned...<\/p>\n","answer_id":23219,"question_id":23215,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1413487685}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23215/understanding-intra-and-extracelullar-concentrations-membrane-potential","last_activity_date":1413520306,"creation_date":1413482495,"answer_count":1,"title":"Understanding intra and extracelullar concentrations (membrane potential)","body":"<p>I have 4 question (not homework)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens to the cells membrane potential if:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>a) Na+ outside rises by 40mM<\/p>\n\n<p>b) K+ inside rises by 10mM<\/p>\n\n<p>c) K+ outside rises by 10mM<\/p>\n\n<p>d) A- (impermeable ion) inside rises by 100mM<\/p>\n\n<p>e) Na+ outside decline by 50mM<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So my answers are:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>a \u2013 hyperpolarisering (more negative)<\/p>\n\n<p>b \u2013 Depolarisering (more positive)<\/p>\n\n<p>c \u2013 Hyperpolarisering<\/p>\n\n<p>d \u2013 Depolarisering<\/p>\n\n<p>e - Depolarisering<\/p>\n\n<p>I think it like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>Membrane potential is the DIFFERENCE in electrical potential inside and outside the cell.

As I'm sure you've heard on the news, ebola is spread by contact with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059478\" rel=\"nofollow\">contaminated fluid<\/a>s.  I would like to point out a <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1410741\" rel=\"nofollow\">wonderful info-graphic<\/a> that was made for public consumption, especially the image on viral life cycle:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8cxav.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic on ebolaviruses life cycle\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming that you're not going splunking in bat inhabited caves in West Africa, it's safe to assume that what we are worried about is human to human transmission through infectious fluids.  Ebola actual isn't that stable <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=SLA-1%200401%20and%20identification%20of%20influenza%20A%20H1N1%20virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">in water<\/a>, so just soaking a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12875924\" rel=\"nofollow\">surface in water and a little oil<\/a> might help you out (if you don't have bleach handy).  I want to be clear that I'm not recommending this, in reality you should just avoid contaminated objects.  I think that we have clearly established that what we're really concerned about is infectious bodily fluid.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads me to the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61343-X\" rel=\"nofollow\">wonderful note<\/a> by <a href=\"http://www.hem.waw.pl/?idp=10&amp;cmd=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jose Martin-Moreno<\/a> titled \"Is respiratory protection appropriate in the Ebola response?\"  I don't think I can express the problem better than he can, so hopefully I will be allowed a substantial quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This transmission [of ebola] occurs via close family contact or in\n  health-care settings, particularly when placing orotracheal intubation\n  or when caring for a patient who is vomiting or bleeding. Ebola is\n  rarely transmitted via an airborne route. Although these routes of\n  transmission are well known, most agencies, including governmental\n  agencies responsible for repatriating western patients, apply\n  infection-control measures appropriate for airborne diseases.\n  Excessive precautions could offer reassurance to those responding to\n  Ebola, yet complete respiratory protection is expensive,\n  uncomfortable, and unaffordable for countries that are the most\n  affected. Worse, such an approach suggests that the only defence is\n  individual protective equipment, which is inaccessible to the general\n  population. Moreover, the image of workers with spectacular protective\n  clothing might contribute to the panic in some communities. If this\n  leads people to flee affected areas it could increase the spread of\n  infection.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>With that said, all your full face gas mask is going to help with is prevention of fluids from hitting your head.  You could probably take the actual filters out to breath more easily (I find breathing in them a giant pain).  And as @Chris pointed out, they are easily clogged which could necessitate the need to take off the whole mask (which might be doing some good) to prevent suffocation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Moving to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods\" rel=\"nofollow\">hazmat<\/a> suit.<\/h2>\n\n<p>It's actually good news that you don't need the air containment of the suit, as that's the hardest element to maintain.  To state the obvious, the main purpose of the suit is to prevent your body from coming in contact with infectious fluids (in this case).  To do that you don't need to be in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure_personnel_suit\" rel=\"nofollow\">positive pressure personnel suit (PPPE)<\/a>, or follow <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL5_sect_IV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">BSL4 considerations<\/a>.  The respiratory concerns from in an BSL4 environment come from other select agents, and the personal working in such a facility are going to be doing very different activities from what you should be doing as person trying to avoid an outbreak (they could be purposefully growing up purified high-titer virus stocks and running around with pointy things as an example).<\/p>\n\n<p>Here I'm going to run into citation problems because no one (that I could find) has tested the kind of scenario I'm about to discuss, so it should be seen as informed conjecture.  Assuming yous suit is actually an analog of a <a href=\"http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/personal-protective-equipment/chemical-protective-garments/brands/tychem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tychem<\/a> QC suit, it's probably not a rated OSHA unit (A-D), but that doesn't necessarily matter.<\/p>\n\n<p>On it's first use it would likely be sufficient to protect against incidental exposure.  Let's assume for the sake of argument that you didn't run into any Ebola when you used it as a costume, and don't the next time you put it on.  At this point decontamination (decon) isn't the concern, failure of the material is.  In other words, are you sure you don't have any holes, tears or cracks in the material?  I think this is going to be the real limiting factor in the life of the suit.  Using good old fashioned duct tape will be give you a few more uses, but the suits are just not designed to last through prolonged use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's assume the worst and that you get substantial blood splatter on you (while wearing your suit) from an ebola patient.  And not a little that could easily be wiped of with a spray bottle of 10% bleach and a paper towel (how most decon could be done).  Instead let's assume you're standing next to someone who suffers a traumatic injury on top of having <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">ebola virus disease (EVD)<\/a>.  I'm imagining something like a point-blank shotgun wound or, given the probability of this scenario, a falling grand piano. In this case, you're going to want to decontaminate the suit before you take it off, which is the same thing professionals are going to do.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're friends with your local fire department, and you live in an area with a large enough population to have a HAZMAT team, you can probably get them to at least give you a run through of how it's done in ideal conditions.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuYDqh3gsk4\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube videos<\/a> are also not hard to find, just search <a href=\"http://jestc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JESTC<\/a> and decontamination.<\/p>\n\n<p>Presumably you would have a hard time going through several rinse and wash steps, but you would want emulate this as much as possible.  With ebola, you would be fine to decontaminate with a 10% bleach solution (or if you use bargain/cheap bleach 15%).  The trick is that you would want to do it a few times, and with a friend (also hopefully in a suit).  Thus if you got two generic soap sprayers, filled one with 10% bleach, and the other with water, and then alternated spraying your partner with bleach and water, wiping down as you went, you should be able to decon the suit pretty well.  If possible you're going to want to collect all the run off an rinsate.  Again professionals tend to use actual kiddie pools for this. <\/p>\n\n<p>But just the act of using so much bleach on the suit is going to weaken the fabric, again leading to the principle problem of failure of the fabric. Thus I would be worried that such a suit would provide a false sense of security, leading one to go into dangerous infectious environments when one shouldn't.  Just avoiding and going away from contaminated individuals is going to be the best solution, regardless of a suit.<\/p>\n\n<p>I considered going into why I think it's highly unlikely that any of the ebolaviruses would evolve to be airborne, but I consider that outside the scope of the question.<\/p>\n","answer_id":21998,"question_id":21939,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1413473979}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21939/ebola-cleaning-of-protective-suit","last_activity_date":1413487038,"creation_date":1412716452,"answer_count":1,"title":"Ebola: cleaning of protective suit","body":"<p>As far as I know, in developed countries protection suits used by people who treat patients with Ebola are disposed of after a shift.<\/p>\n\n<p>From a rather ambitious costume last year, I still have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods\" rel=\"nofollow\">hazmat<\/a> suit like <a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XevZr2oXL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.conney.com/wcsstore/Conney/images/fullsize/z75345.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> full-face gas mask.<\/p>\n\n<p>More out of curiosity than out of real concern, I was wondering whether it would be possible to use this equipment in a potential outbreak of the virus.

Lets have a look at the protein itself first, as this is important for the activation.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">PKA<\/a> consists of four subunits, two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. See the image from the Wikipedia article on PKA:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SnurS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Each regulatory subunit R is binding two cyclic AMP (cAMP) molecules and dissociates then from the protein complex. This sets the catalytic subunits free, which can then transfer phosphate groups from ATP to serine or threonine residues of target proteins. Among the target proteins is also the Phosphodiesterase (PDE) which gets activated by phosphorylation from PKA. Activated PDE hydrolyzes cAMP into AMP which reduces the amount of free cAMP which is necessary for PKA activation. PKA is also inactivated by phosphorylation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the cell you will find PKA almost everywhere. The traditional belief is that the protein is activated in the cytosol and enters the nucleus where it phosphorylates targets like CREB which then subsequently binds the the CRE sequence in gene promoters and activates this genes. Reference 1 shows that PKA is also activated in the nucleus, meaning that also the inactive form is present there. Reference 2 gives a nice summary of the article.<\/p>\n\n<p>The regulatory subunit of inactive form of PKA binds to a special class of proteins: The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKAP\" rel=\"nofollow\">A-kinase anchor proteins<\/a> (AKAP). These are membrane bound and allow the association of PKA to membranes, although the protein itself is not directly binding to the membrane. The AKAP family is rather big (at least 50 family members are known today), which probably allows the localization of PKA at different membranes.

First, Mycobacteria tuberculosis is present for a long time in the human population and evolved to evade our immune system. One of the keys are glycolipids and sugars which are part of the bacterial cell wall. These either help suppressing an immune response or help the bacteria to enter host cells in which they can stay without being identified by the immune system. See references 1-3 for details on this topic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then most tuberculosis infections are hold of by the immune system, mostly they come up, when the carriers immune system is compromised. M. tuberculosis can successfully hide inside macrophages and multiply there and start an infection from this hiding place. See references 4 and 5 for more details here.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the main problems with the development of new vaccines is that this takes quite a long time from successful experiments in the lab to the availability of a usable vaccine. Tuberculosis has been neglected here for decades. Then the market for such a vaccine wasn't deemed lucrative enough from the pharma companies, as this is mostly important for poor and developing countries. For use there, the vaccine needs to be cheap and easy to administer. Additionally humans are the main host for M.tuberculosis which makes chossing appropriate animal models for research and testing not an easy task.<\/p>\n\n<p>The development of novel vaccine candidates follow different routes. First, there are live vaccinations, which mainly consist of modified strains of the BCG vaccine strain. Then there are vaccines in the development which are supposed to support the immune answer by BCG and finally, there are vaccines which are independent of BCG and are mostly composed from proteins of the outer bacterial cell wall. For an overview about this field, I can recommend the review articles 6 and 7, if you want to go deeper in the field, also the references 8-10.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://iai.asm.org/content/77/10/4574.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall Glycolipids Directly Inhibit\nCD4+ T-Cell Activation by Interfering with Proximal T-Cell-Receptor\nSignaling<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22880012\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divergent Effects of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Glycolipids on\nMaturation and Function of Human Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0966842X98013018/1-s2.0-S0966842X98013018-main.pdf?_tid=06531716-5520-11e4-8e2c-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1413455856_eef5bac024d3f6ab671c91a859c6cbed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host cells: are\nmycobacterial sugars the key?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3777/rfv5wsfq_pdf.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Annulling a dangerous liaison: vaccination strategies against AIDS\nand tuberculosis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/191/1/65.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Macrophages Play a Dual Role during Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Mice<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002607\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vaccines against Tuberculosis: Where Are We and Where Do We Need to\nGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/14/S1/S2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vaccine against tuberculosis: what\u2019s new<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://genmico.unizar.es/PDF/MartinOp2006.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tuberculosis vaccines: past, present and future.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3777/ifggnqzo_pdf.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Childhood tuberculosis: old and new vaccines.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/download/23492994/837\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exploiting the mycobacterial cell wall to design improved vaccines\nagainst tuberculosis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":23205,"question_id":23186,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23186/what-if-anything-about-tuberculosis-makes-producing-a-highly-effective-vaccine","last_activity_date":1413458525,"creation_date":1413425247,"answer_count":1,"title":"What (if anything) about tuberculosis makes producing a highly effective vaccine difficult?","body":"<p>What about tuberculosis makes it difficult to produce a safe vaccine that is effective at producing an immunogenic response in >99% of individuals against all strains of the bacteria?<\/p>\n\n<p>I am aware of the BCG vaccine which has a variable efficacy depending on how it is measured and am aware of the 4 current vaccine candidates (MVA85A, rBCG30, 72F fusion protein, and ESAT6-Ag85b fusion protein).

Some B cells change into memory cells, which remember that specific antigen, and others change into plasma cells. Plasma cells produce antibodies that are specific to the antigen that stimulated their production. <\/p>\n\n<p>After the first encounter with an antigen, production of enough of the specific antibody takes several days. Thus, the primary immune response is slow and that's the reason you experience the symptoms of the disease.<\/p>\n\n<p>But thereafter, whenever B cells encounter the antigen again, memory B cells very rapidly recognize the antigen, multiply, change into plasma cells, and produce antibodies. This response is quick and very effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that, theoretically, you shouldn't be able to become sick twice by the same virus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>However,<\/strong> \nvirus are very prone to mutations. If these mutations occur in the genes that code for antibody-binding sites, the antibodies produced by B Cells become less effective.

During mouse gonadogenesis, Sox9 is detected in the male\n  gonad at 11.5 days postcoitus (dpc). At 12.5 dpc, testicular cords\n  form, morphologically distinguishing the male gonad from the ovary.\n  From this stage onwards, Sox9 expression is restricted to the Sertoli\n  cell lineage and persists in the adult. Humans with heterozygous\n  mutations in SOX9 develop a skeletal syndrome known as campomelic\n  dysplasia. Furthermore, most XY SOX9 heterozygotes show variable\n  male-to-female sex reversal, implicating SOX9 in testis development.\n  Sox9 heterozygous knockout mice die at birth with a syndrome similar\n  to that of human campomelic dysplasia. In contrast to humans, XY\n  Sox9+/- mice form normal appearing testes. Germ-line knockout of Sox9\n  using a conditional null allele provides a tool for generating Sox9-/-\n  mice by simple genetic crosses. However, Sox9-/- mice die soon after\n  11.5 dpc because of cardiovascular defects. In vitro culture of the urogenital ridges of XY Sox9-/- results in gonads lacking testicular\n  cords and Sertoli cell marker expression, but with the expression of\n  ovarian-specific markers. Therefore, Sox9 is essential for diverting\n  an intrinsically ovarian program of organogenesis toward testis\n  formation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:98371\" rel=\"nofollow\">MGI page<\/a> on Sox9:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Null mutant heterozygotes and conditional knockout mutants display\n  perinatal lethality with cleft palate, hypoplasia and distortion of\n  numerous cartilage-derived skeletal structures, and premature\n  mineralization in many bones.

Diversity of PAMPs is extremely limited compared to the extraordinary diversity in recognition by the active immune system. However, they include many molecules and classes of molecules that are essential for certain pathogens, such as flagellin, lipopolysaccharide, and viral double-stranded RNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer some of your question right away, the immune system can't adapt, but it can recognize antigens that the body hasn't seen before, because the set of antigens it can recognize (the PAMPs) are dictated by the genes associated with Toll-Like Receptors and other \"Pattern-Recognition Receptors\".<\/p>\n\n<h2>Exception 1: T cell anergy<\/h2>\n\n<p>The major link between the innate and active immune systems that you mentioned is through the presentation of antigens to T helper cells in lymph nodes by DCs: DCs present antigens (digested parts of pathogens) to T helper cells through a process called antigen cross-presentation.<\/p>\n\n<p>When this happens, the T helper cell is activated through a series of chemical exchanges between the DC and the T helper cell, with two that are important to mention here: 1) the T cell recognizes the antigen\u2013MHC class II complex on the DC (called T cell stimulation), and 2) the T cell receives a signal (called co-stimulation). The first signal only requires cross-presentation and recognition by a T cell. But for the DC to release the co-stimulatory signal, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) on its surface need to have recognized a PAMP.<\/p>\n\n<p>With these interactions (plus some more), the T cell will begin proliferating. However, immunology is very nuanced; you can probably find exceptions to every sentence I just wrote (I see a lot even while writing this). It turns out that a T cell can still be activated even without co-stimulation if its own stimulation is strong enough. This occurs through a process called T cell anergy. Activation of an anergic T cell\u2014that is, one that was activated but did not receive a co-stimulation signal\u2014has to do with the autocrine and paracrine nature of a signal called IL-2, which T cells normally produce only small amounts of but produce much more when fully stimulated.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Exception 2: B cells T-independent activation<\/h2>\n\n<p>But T cells are only half of the active immune system. It turns out that B cell activation follows similar rules, though not through DCs. B cell activation usually occurs with help from activated T helper cells (only one that recognizes the antigen the B cell is specific for). However, B cells can become activated without T cell help in two situations: an antigen binds to the B cell receptor and to a TLR, or 2) the B cell receptors become saturated with highly repetitive epitopes. Situation #2 technically occurs without help of the innate immune system.<\/p>\n\n<p>So you're mostly correct that the active immune system requires innate immune system help, except that there are these two exceptions. And since immunology has so many exceptions, there are likely to be more.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23119,"question_id":23103,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1413350894}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23103/is-the-innate-immune-system-capable-of-identifying-all-foreign-antigens","last_activity_date":1413350894,"creation_date":1413311565,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is the innate immune system capable of identifying all foreign antigens?","body":"<p>I've been studying immunology on my own lately and I would like to know if the macrophages and the other components of the innate immune system are capable of identifying all foreign antigens.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I understand the innate immune system is responsible for activating the adaptive immune response that will produce antibodies.

As @Chris mentioned, transported atoms and molecules don't typically retain a record of their past history, so just by looking at a molecule in the cell you can't in general tell how it arrived in the cell (an exception might be proteins that have some chemical modification on them that allows them to be imported via a specific mechanism, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannose_6-phosphate\" rel=\"nofollow\">mannose-6-phosphate enzyme re-uptake system<\/a>). In order to infer if a molecule typically enters a cell by a particular method, you will have to do several different types of experiments. I'll list a few off of the top of my head. <em>Note to other SE contributors:<\/em> since this is not my area of expertise, I'm not sure how feasible some of these experiments are, or how they are typically done, so please edit my answer to be more accurate!<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diffusion<\/strong> If you want to know if something <em>can<\/em> diffuse across a membrane, then the easiest way would be to try it <em>in vitro.<\/em> One way I can imagine doing this is to use a phospholipid bilayer to separate two compartments: one with your molecule of interest, one without. By measuring the concentration of your molecule that transfers from one compartment to the other, you can see if your molecule can diffuse across a lipid bilayer. Note that this will only tell you if diffusion is <em>possible<\/em> for your molecule. It may be that cells have ways to actively prevent your molecule from diffusing across your membranes, which you wouldn't be able to know from this assay.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Endocytosis or pinocytosis<\/strong> One way to assess if your molecule is taken up by endocytosis or pinocytosis would be to knock out (genetically or with an inhibitory drug) these processes in your cell and see if your molecule of interest still ends up in the cell. Depending on the context of the molecule you're interested in, you might be able to simply place cells in solution with your molecule of interest and measure the concentration of the molecule outside the cells over time. You could compare how much of your molecule is lost from solution when cells can't endocytose and compare to when they can; if your molecule stays around when cells endocytose, you have some indication that process is necessary. Note that there would have to be a lot of other controls for this experiment as well: e.g. ensuring the effect you observe is specifically caused by endocytosis being inhibited. Since endocytosis and pinocytosis form vesicle intermediates containing your particle of interest, one check to see if endocytosis might be reasonable is to see if you can see vesicles containing your molecule of interest in the cell. Of course, this requires a method for being able to visualize your molecule of interest (maybe it's fluorescent, or can be modified with a fluorescent marker? Or maybe there is a fluorescent protein that binds your molecule and can change color on binding? These things all exist, they just depend on your particular molecule and context).<\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Transport channels:<\/strong> In a similar vein, how does the uptake of your molecule change when you inhibit or remove from the cell a particular type of channel? You could measure this in a similar way as the bullet point above.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Active vs passive transport:<\/strong> If you wanted to see if uptake of your molecule requires active transport, you could try inhibiting ATP synthesis with a drug and see if transport of your molecule decreases over time. Note that this is in general not good for the cell (really!), so you might also have to have some more controls for this, maybe showing that transport of a molecule known to travel by passive transport is not affected on the timescale you're looking at, for example.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it gives you a sense of the type of experiments and ways of thinking you might be able to use to figure this out. Some general thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This tends to be case-by-case.<\/strong> While the type of experiments you might do to determine the mode of transport for different molecules are similar, the controls you will have to do to shore up your conclusions will really depend on the system involved, what type of effect a molecule has on your cells, whether your cell imports <em>and<\/em> exports this molecule, under what circumstances you might expect the cell to take up this molecule (so you have a way to trigger the cells to take up this molecule for your experiment). I don't know of a completely generic method for resolving this type of question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Being able to measure abundance of your molecule is important.<\/strong> All of the experiments above rely on being able to measure the concentration of your molecule, either outside of the cell, or inside of the cell. This is often easiest if you can modify your molecule to be visualizable in a microscope or spectrophotometer, but however you do it, you need a good, reliable, robust assay in order to make strong conclusions with this assay. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls are <em>really<\/em> important.<\/strong> Thinking up all the different alternative possibilities and trying to come up with ways to rule them out is the heart of experimental science. Fortunately, it also happens to often be rewarding and thought-provoking!

They are one shot (or a series of a few). Say that a chest Xray (two views) doses you with .1 mSv of radiation. The dose from a standard chest CT is 7 mSv.<sup>[1]<\/sup> That is 70 times what a chest film gives you, not a few hundred (though that might seem like quibbling). The TL;DR answer is: no one knows for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Radiation (especially in fetuses -children) increases the likelihood of cancer. Our information comes mostly from atomic bomb survivors, people exposed at Chernobyl, people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of background radiation, e.g. uranium miners. <\/p>\n\n<p>Can one CT scan increase your chance of developing cancer? Yes, but how <em>significant<\/em> that is remains debatable. It depends on a lot of unmeasurable things: genetics, your age, your ability to repair the damage, which area of the body is being dosed, whether there are other carcinogens at work (e.g. viruses or co-carcinogens), etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following are commonly found numbers (which does not mean they're accurate). Given 10,000 people, about 2000 will die of non-radiation related cancers. If you expose those 10,000 people to 10 mSv of radiation, you can expect 5-6 additional cancer deaths in that 10,000 (or .5% increase). <sup>[2]<\/sup> However, if you expose someone to 10 mSv twice, with two months in between, the risk does not double. <\/p>\n\n<p>The average dose of radiation per year from background sources is 1.5-3.5 mSv/yr.<sup>[3]<\/sup> <sup>[4]<\/sup> Because of our ability to repair damaged DNA over time, it's generally estimated that, from natural background radiation, the risk of developing cancer from background radiation is about 1% of our total cancer risk.<sup>[5]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>So, let's say that your average CT scan is going to give you 7 mSv of exposure (that's a high estimate). What is your chance of getting a <em>lethal cancer<\/em> from that? The answer is: no one knows.<sup>[6]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Relative risk has be calculated by some. The following all give you a (estimated) 1 in a million chance of dying from that event<sup>[7]<\/sup>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Smoking 1.4 cigarettes (lung cancer)  <\/li>\n  <li>Eating 40 tablespoons of peanut butter<\/li>\n  <li>Spending 2 days in New York City (air pollution)  <\/li>\n  <li>Driving 40 miles in a car (accident)  <\/li>\n  <li>Flying 2500 miles in a jet (accident)  <\/li>\n  <li>Canoeing for 6 minutes  <\/li>\n  <li>Receiving 10 mrem (.1 mSv) of radiation (cancer) <\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, you can estimate that (maybe) the risk of dying from a 7 mSv CT scan is about equivalent to driving 2800 miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>The point of all this is, no one knows your exact risk of developing a lethal or r<em>elatively non-lethal<\/em> cancer (yes, that does exist) from an imaging study. Most ethical Radiologists will tell you there is no known safe radiation exposure, and that one should avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.
