Not all animal types are found there that are best for the climate; its a matter of accident that some birds or lizards are found on the galapagos islands.

The aquatic mud dwellers might have been washed there by rain, or they might have migrated there like the others. In the case of a lake, all of these will happen, although slower because of a lack of sediment with concrete walls. The fish would depend on whether or not there is a waterway connecting the lake to an area where fish already live. These events would happen in the first year except for fish, and pretty soon algae will be growing right after the animals moved, or during, and plants will start to grow as well, their seeds or whatever they use to spread will make their way to the lake.

It's small volume will get cooked by constant direct sun, which will impede the results.\nAfter a few weeks (might be faster), look closely into the water (through the sides of the jar) with a magnifying glass, or better still, sample the water and look under a microscope. You won't see, but they are there, multiple bacterial species.\nYou will see single celled algae, small pond creatures (hydra, rotary-topped species (multiple)), paramecia, and multi-celled algal forms in strings. These are all fallen in from airborne dust and windblown particles.  You likely won't get fish, but if you are lucky, you might get a few brine shrimp.  And yes, particles of blown or bird-carried dirt etc can easily carry shrimp, amphibian, or plausibly, viable fish eggs.<\/p>\n\n<p>But what do they feed on?  There's no food in the water you put in !!  CO2, nitrogen, Oxygen, etc are readily available from the air. A few cells of bacteria or algal forms seed the clean water, and begin fixing CO2, nitrogen etc, and now you have a food source. Wind-carried (or bird-carried) small organisms can now survive in a web of bacteria-plant-animal interactions.\nBy the way, you can also run a control jar, where you sterilize the jar, fill it with boiling hot water, and quickly cover it tightly with foil. Place it beside your open jar, and it will grow...nothing. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a side note, \"toxic\" algae are often not toxic to small organisms and other algae.

Clin. Toxicol. 47: 312 - 6<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently in the Klockhoff test for Menière's disease the patient is given an oral glycerol dose of 1.2 - 1.5 g/kg (50% in water) then observed over a period of 4-5 h. The other details of the test don't concern us here. In this case report a patient suffering neurological symptoms was found to have previously undergone a Klockhoff test at another hospital, and it was estimated that he must have received a dose of 3.88 \u20133.95 g/kg.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are two sections from the paper's introduction (references removed).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Glycerol is well known as a nontoxic substance (LD50 > 25 g/kg in the rat). Possible side effects of the Klockhoff test include headache and nausea. During treatment of brain edema, additional adverse effects such as diarrhea and vomiting were reported, symptoms comparable to those reported for intensive osmolar diuretics. The GESTIS database ranks glycerol in general as a substance with very low toxicity. However, severe symptoms after oral ingestion of glycerol have been reported to occur. Doses exceeding 0.7 g/kg BW have been regarded as potentially toxic for adults. After doses of up to 1.4 g/kg BW, only mild symptoms such as headache, nausea, and diuresis appear. Reportedly, these symptoms are also associated with glycerol treatment of brain edema. In individual cases, an oral dose of 100 g of glycerol has been reported to cause drowsiness, cyanosis, renal pain, and bloody diarrhea.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Martindale Reference Desk reports headache, thirst, nausea, and hyperglycemia as adverse effects. Glycerol may also produce cardiac arrhythmia and hyperosmolar nonketonic coma. These effects are mainly based on its dehydrating properties. Hemolysis has been reported to exclusively occur after intravenous infusion. In fact, most of the major toxic effects of glycerol, such as hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure, seem to strictly correlate with serum concentration of glycerol and the route of administration.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears then that any toxic effects of glycerol are not due to its alcohol nature <em>per se<\/em> but rather because it can become elevated in the blood leading to osmotic effects. The authors estimated that 10 h after administraion of the glycerol the concentration in the patient's serum was approximately 39 mM, compared to a physiological basal level in the range 0.05\u20130.3 mmol/L. The patient's serum level fell to the basal level over a period of 30 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just to put this in some perspective, in the UK the legal alcohol limit for drivers is 80 mg/100 mL which corresponds to 17.4 mmol/L.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that recommending sugar alcohols would fall under the heading of medical advice (not that I have any such recommendations).<\/p>\n","answer_id":13557,"question_id":13547,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1384807956}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13547/can-sugar-alcohols-and-glycerol-in-particular-cause-intoxication","last_activity_date":1384809639,"creation_date":1384756212,"answer_count":1,"title":"Can sugar alcohols, and glycerol in particular, cause intoxication?","body":"<p>I'm mostly curious about <strong>glycerol<\/strong>, which I use as a sweetener.

Examples include a lot of classics from ecological theory, such as <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lotka-VolterraEquations.html\">Lotka-Volterra models<\/a> of predation and competition, but there are also people who still do this kind of research, such as <a href=\"http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Faculty/chesson/storage_effect.htm\">Peter Chesson in his research on the storage effect<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Numerical ecology - this is not a term that I've heard used very frequently, but I think it tends to cluster pretty closely with mathematical ecology, perhaps with more of an emphasis on also including and analyzing empirical data. I hear it used more to refer to techniques than actual ongoing areas of research.<\/p>\n\n<p>Statistical ecology - I think this term gets used more loosely because obviously statistics are important to most ecology research. It can either refer to research that makes heavy use of advanced statistics because the questions that its getting at are hard to untangle from other effects, or research that uses a statistical model to make its point (note that statistical models are generally different from the mathematical models mentioned above in that their goal is generally to determine how likely something is to happen rather than to untangle some fundamental principle of ecology). A lot of studies on neutral vs. niche-based community assembly would probably fall into the category of statistical ecology. <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/biosci/news/2009/10/20_niche_versus_neutral_theory.page\">Here is one of many examples<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ecoinformatics - maybe this is just because I study ecoinformatics, but I tend to think that this is the most distinct of the fields that you mentioned, although it certainly still has a great deal of overlap with the others, especially since it's a pretty diverse subfield. In general, ecoinformatics focuses on making use of large datasets in ecology. This involves both research on developing methods for doing this (for example, I study ways to efficiently collect information from ecological wireless sensor networks. Another good example is the <a href=\"http://kellylab.berkeley.edu/keck-engine/\">development of GIS tools<\/a>) and research that uses these methods (e.g. a study that uses GIS to synthesize sensor data and observations of a given organism to determine what that organism's range will be as climate change progresses, or that otherwise seeks to <a href=\"http://csilimnology.org/\">pull ecological concepts out of the data<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Computational ecology - I left this until last, because I think it's the vaguest of the labels you listed. It definitely includes ecoinformatics, but it probably also includes a lot of statistical ecology (and perhaps numerical and mathematical ecology too). I think that the main reason that it's a useful label is that it can catch areas of research that don't really fit in to the other labels. For instance, I once saw a study on <a href=\"http://se-server.ethz.ch/staff/af/fi159/d/dr013.pdf\">quantifying niche space using support vector machines<\/a>. It was really interesting, and maybe it could be classified as ecoinformatics or statistical ecology, but it didn't really quite fit into either of those. So I guess I tend to see computational ecology as a catch-all term.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are just the impressions that I have gotten - if others chime in too we can probably build a better consensus definition of these labels.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13528,"question_id":11384,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11384/definitions-and-examples-of-some-math-releated-ecology-branches","last_activity_date":1384748100,"creation_date":1383921135,"answer_count":1,"title":"Definitions and examples of some math-releated ecology branches","body":"<p>I would like to have an example of application and a brief description/definition (two or three lines) of the following fields.

They are just sitting on one connector. If another connector passed over them, completing the circuit across them, then a current might pass across them for a very short time. But I doubt they grow on the top of the rail (which is the contact part in the UK system) as that is constantly being polished smooth by the contacts from trains sliding across it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding cell damage: Apart from fibrillation in animals, and burns caused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating\">Joule heating<\/a>, electricity does cause cellular damage. <\/p>\n\n<p>At low frequencies (&lt;10kHz), electricity disrupts cell membranes and makes them much more permeable (we actually harness this when we use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation\">electroporation<\/a> to transform bacteria). All organisms rely on electrochemical potential differences across membranes for their metabolism (<a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/w99lc1m1a1kwtmld/\">Berry, 2002<\/a>). The exact effect is dependent on the previous electrical state of the cells, for example the electrical potential difference across the membrane, and on the surface area to volume ratio of the cell (greater volume relative to surface area leads to more disruption). In any case, extreme electroporation can cause solutes to flow in or out of a cell, and generally disrupt the balance of solute concentrations and cause organelles and other bodies to move out of a cell. When the electrical stimulation stops, the contents are then fixed in a disrupted state. The cell then has to expend enormous amounts of ATP using ion channels and transport proteins in an attempt to reinstate the necessary chemiosmotic potentials, and in doing so exhausts the entire ATP supply and goes into biochemical arrest (no metabolism occurs), which is when a cell is dead. Dead cells break apart because there are is no maintenance occuring.<\/p>\n\n<p>At higher frequencies (10-100kHz) proteins become permanently denatured. Many proteins carry charges which give them an overall polarity. When placed in an electric field, the proteins reorient themselves and will undergo conformational change to achieve the optimum dipole moment in the direction of the field. Ion channels and pumps are particularly sensitive to these disruptions (since their charges are crucial to their function).<\/p>\n\n<p>Rather than provide lots of references, there is one excellent review from which I drew all this information, and which you should read for more of the physical detail (<a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.bioeng.2.1.477\">Lee et al., 2000<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Berry, S.

In brief, nearly every stage of obtaining the structure via crystallography is more difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>First: <em>protein expression<\/em>.  Large amounts of pure, well-folded protein are required and this is much more difficult to achieve than it is with a soluble protein. Since membrane proteins are bound within a membrane, the mechanisms to translate the peptide into the membrane and to fold the protein in the membrane are different.  They may involved folding factors which are only available in a particular compartment of the cell (making bacteria impossible as a system of expression).  In high amounts in the cell, their hydrophobicity might tend to result in clumps of unfolded protein instead of gobs of membrane-associated protein. <\/p>\n\n<p>Next: <em>Purifying the protein<\/em> is more difficult.  The expressing cells are usually broken open in the presence of detergent to get the proteins to float around as individual proteins in detergent micelles.   The wrong detergents might break up the membrane protein and it may lose its fold - the concentration of detergent must be carefully managed and kept at optimal levels or the micelles might break up and the protein will be ruined.  <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Crystallizing the protein<\/em> is quite a bit more difficult too.  Membrane proteins in detergent micelles which may or may not be charged themselves look like oily blobs with hopefully a domain or two of folded proteins sticking out of them.  Compared to a soluble protein with a nice ordered surface in every direction instead of a detergent micelle which might undergo a phase change at high concentration or by the addition of a salt or change in pH, membrane proteins take a task that might take thousands of trials and adds new dimensions to worry about.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The proteins are 2D-like, but the crystals still have to be 3D for crystallography to work usually.  Protein crystals are small, but those derived from membrane proteins - which tend to organize into planes like the membranes they inhabit - are often thin, which can make them too delicate and small to get a good set of data even from synchrotron beams.  As a result, the crystals are commonly too small or thin to use at first, requiring extensive optimization after the first crystal are found. <\/p>\n\n<p>Not to make all this sound impossible - once you have crystals, they can usually be improved; <a href=\"http://sbkb.org/update/research/tips-for-crystallizing-membrane-proteins\" rel=\"nofollow\">there are good starting points to crystallization and purification with detergents<\/a>.

When you find the active fraction you then subject that to a different type of fractionation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Salting out<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The solubility of proteins is affected by the ionic strength of the buffer. If the ionic strength is raised above a critical value (which is a characteristic of an individual protein) the protein  will precpitate, usually without being denatured. By doing a series of such precipitations at increasing ionic strengths a protein mixture can be fractionated according to this property. The salt used is ammonium sulphate, because of its very high solubility. You can find more details at this Wikipedia page (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate_precipitation\" rel=\"nofollow\">ammonium sulphate precipitation<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ion exchange chromatography<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Proteins have different intrinsic charges, and the net charge on a protein will vary with pH. This property is exploited in<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_exchange_chromatography\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ion-exchange chromatography<\/a>. In this technique the protein mixture interacts with a solid matrix carrying fixed charges. Under the correct conditions your protein plus others will bind to the matrix, while lots of other proteins won't. That's already a purification step, but you can then treat the matrix with buffers of increasing ionic strength. Weakly-bound proteins will be eluted from the matrix first, and as the ionic strength of the elution buffer increases proteins will elute in order of strength of interaction. By performing this procedure with the matrix in the form of a chromatography column and collecting eluate fractions you can achieve another step in the purification of your protein.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Size exclusion chromatography (gel filtration)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This technique is used to fractionate a mixture of molecules according to size. In this case the solid matrix that is used is charaterised by pores of a specific size. Proteins that are too large to enter the pores will pass through quickly;  small proteins will spend a lot of time moving in and out of the pores and so will pass through slowly; and proteins of intermediate size will spend some time in the pores. Essentially the average time spent passing through the matrix will depend upon size. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate_precipitation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are just three of the possible fractionation procedures - others, including  hydrophobic interaction chromatography are described <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_exchange_chromatography\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>). The key point to grasp is that using any one of these techniques will give you your protein in a fraction which also contains other proteins, but if you apply them sequentially you will progressively remove contaminants because each approach is based on a different physical property of proteins, and your target will have a unique combination of these properties. <\/p>\n\n<p>At each step you will be assaying fractions to locate the protein of interest, and also running fractions on  SDS-PAGE to get a feeling for the number of proteins left. If you have an assay that lends itself to measuring some kind of unit of activity (as you would with an enzyme), then by also measuring the protein content of the active fraction you can express the purity as a <em>specific activity<\/em> (units of activity per mg protein). At each step in your purification this specific activity should increase because you recover most of the activity, but discard a lot of the proteins that were present in the previous material. The increase in specific activity can be used to assign \na <em>purification factor<\/em> to each step. A useful purification step will give a reasonable yield in combination with sigificant purification.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, what order to do these steps in? I've listed them in a logical order - salt precipitation is a low-tech method that can give a quick first step and which has the advantage that it concentrates the target protein (since the precipitate is redissolved in fresh buffer). Size-exclusion chromatography doesn't deal well with large amounts of protein so is best left until later. However, protein purification is a craft, and an expert will use the available techniques according to the exact nature of the project.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>From the tone of your original question I had inferred that you were a beginner, but from your comments, apparently not, since you are thinking in terms of mass spec as an endpoint.

This could be an immune response and a taste for a certain plant containing compounds with remedial properties.  If either system is adequate to resist the disease, hasn't selection gone above and beyond what is needed? <\/p>\n\n<p>If so, the answer is either not recently, or all the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, for 'not really' you have to consider the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_Hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">importance of competition.  Reading about the Red Queen's Hypothesis is helpful here.<\/a>. First there is a natural random mutation rate, which can cause one of the system to become less effective.  Or if the disease is also changing to increase its efficiency, then either one or both of the defense mechanisms in this case would fail from time to time.  Then having two systems would not be too much. There is a clear benefit to having redundant systems of resistance here. For both these broad categories of reasons, you have much redundancy and interdependence among the genes which create traits in living things (phenotypes).  Because of the background mutation rate, traits which are not needed disappear relatively quickly; because of competition, those which convey an advantage, even if a small one, have a strong likelihood to stay in the gene pool.<\/p>\n\n<p>now: \"all the time\" There are cases where traits are exhibited that are not efficient though. Evolution works over generations, typically selection influences traits on the order of 10s of generations and the population can show traits which are not helpful if the environment or the competition has changed drastically.  <\/p>\n\n<p>An example of this is the current obesity epidemic in the developing world. The sudden availability of cheap food has caused those people who have access to become obese.  This is because they have a heavily reinforced trait to save up fat because humans experience famines regularly.  Its going to take a long time before efficient energy storage in human beings is lost.  In the meantime, people are not living to reproducing age at the same level of fitness they might have.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I want to add a note on genetic algorithms.  The difference between genetic algorithms to achieve the same efficiencies as biological systems are worth thinking about:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>As far as failing to find a global minimum, natural selection usually has many more samples.  A typical selection experiment with flies or worms often have thousands or tens of thousands of individuals screened.  GA models of reasonable complexity have usually a few score at most - am I right?  A bacterial or yeast experiment can have 10^9 individuals. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The genetic system of the chromosome itself is tremendously complex.  We can't even model itself and so the product of millions of generations of selection already will has a heretofore unmodelable response to selection. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The typical selection environment is equally undefinable, so a survey of living things in a complex environment has unpredictable effects.  While most of us think as laboratory experiments as being less complex, its not completely true.  I was at a talk recently that mentioned how E coli K12 seems to have diverged in various laboratory environments despite the fact that its mostly been in frozen stocks since being isolated in the mid 20th century.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":10929,"question_id":10882,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1382106494},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934a90404fe944a01135142de991d393?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4199,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4199/von-mises","reputation":746,"display_name":"von Mises"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1382041812,"creation_date":1382041812,"body":"<p>Im going to take a stab at this. I think he is saying that sometimes there will be mutations that will occur in a population that are beneficial, but only in certain environments. But he is asking, wont these mutations be eliminated often, since they may not be in an environment where their advantage is obvious?<\/p>\n\n<p>First, there is something incorrect in your original post. You said \"From what I understand some genes will be lost because they won't be suited enough to continue in the next generation\". It is kind of unusual for a whole gene to be lost. Especially from a whole population! I think what you mean is 'allele'. And yes some alleles will be lost. But fitness is a gradient. Just because a mutation does not have an obvious advantage does not mean it will be lost. Most mutations are not really noticeable. In a recent post here, I think I quoted a website that says there are 70 or so de novo mutations every generation in humans. This means that both you and I have 70 new mutations that our parents did not. But we are both functioning just fine (I hope!).<\/p>\n\n<p>And some of these mutations may be beneficial in certain environments, but dont do anything in others. Lets say that one of my de novo mutations was to make me sweat less. Not really noticeable, right? And it really wont give me fitness advantage or disadvantage, so natural selection wont really act on it. It's frequency should remain at about a constant level in the population . But now lets say something happens to the world climate and there is a drought that lasts for centuries over N. America. My mutation would now give me a fitness advantage since my body would lose less water.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to answer what I think your question was, natural selection will not always act on every mutation. It has to clearly give a fitness disadvantage to select against it, or an advantage to select for it. So if it gives no immediate advantage, it may not spread through the gene pool very quickly, if at all, but it will still be there. So when it is in an environment where it is advantageous, it will still be around, and then it will begin to spread through the population.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10931,"question_id":10882,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10882/wont-natural-selection-miss-the-overall-minimum-of-a-function","last_activity_date":1384701032,"creation_date":1381848280,"answer_count":2,"title":"Won't natural selection miss the overall minimum of a function?","body":"<p>Suppose we have a population of about 1000 with an environment that does not change a lot (e.g. the atmosphere is more or less the same) and we leave this population to evolve.

As long as your cells can be stained with Trypan Blue (it's been a long time since I've done bacterial work, pardon my ignorance) to look at viability, then this machine should work quite well. When set to <em>Maximum<\/em> (i.e., the analysis takes as long as possible), I get results in less than 4 minutes per sample - and this includes about a minute for the sample to settle in the flow cell. If you lower the sensitivity, you can get results faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically the way it works is you take 300 μl of your liquid culture (diluted if you think the concentration is too high), and add it to a sample cup. Put all your cups in the tray, fill out the sample info and analysis options in the MultiRun screen, and hit Start. The machine includes all the reagents onboard, so it mixes the Trypan Blue with your samples, then injects the proper amount into a flow cell. The sample is allowed to settle, then a high-resolution image is taken of the entire length of the flow cell. Then, depending on your sensitivity settings, a certain number of frames are taken from the full-length image and analyzed. An average count is then generated based on all the images, and your final numbers are spit out. You can then print or save a report of the cell counts and viability.<\/p>\n\n<p>The software comes with some analysis tools as well, so if you keep multiple cultures going over time with different growth conditions, you can aggregate the data for each one and generate graphs of cell counts, viability, cell size, etc. - there are at least 10 or 20 parameters to choose from. All the image analysis options are configurable, so if you look at the results and think the machine is picking too many dead cells, or not enough, you can change the parameters to your liking, and save the options as a custom analysis type.<\/p>\n\n<p>One option I like that would beat the pants off CFU-based counting (besides the drastically-reduced time) is the fact that the machine can detect aggregation of the cells. One issue with CFUs is that it's hard sometimes to know that a certain colony really arose from just one parent cell - if you let the colonies grow long enough you may be able to tell based on size, but it's a tough call. Since the Cedex is looking at the cells themselves, it doesn't matter if they're aggregated or not, as they'll all get counted (assuming the aggregation particle doesn't contain a huge amount of cells, like 50+, that can't be resolved by the software due to occlusion of the image).<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know how much these guys cost, so depending on your budget you may not be in the market for one, but if you're going to be doing a lot of counting then one of these is invaluable.

I'm not sure that a hemocytometer is the right alternative for my particular high-throughput application (though you could convince me otherwise).

If more purity was desired after the affinity purification step, I could perform salt precipitation or charge separation on the affinity-purified sample, which had already been cleared of major contaminants/nuisance proteins by affinity purification.<\/p>\n","answer_id":13490,"question_id":13489,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":3,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"post_id":13492,"edited":false,"creation_date":1384470403,"comment_id":17485,"body":"+1 for stuffing columns full of meaty gunk :)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":13492,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"edited":false,"creation_date":1384484581,"comment_id":17489,"body":"thanks :) my first tech job involved collecting adrenal glands at a slaughterhouse.  they did not smell or look good - no way you&#39;d put that on a $300 column!

As @A.Kennart points out, affinity chromatography is the most popular right now.  It can be expensive.  If you have an expression system for a recombinant protein its more common than not to add a poly-Histdine tag on the N or C terminus or some other protein fusion.  So there are cases where you won't be able to use it. <\/p>\n\n<p>For instance if the protein you are looking for is not coming from a recombinant source / is not sequenced, it can get expensive and time consuming - getting an antibody made requires that you have a somewhat pure prep of the protein in the first place. <\/p>\n\n<p>The most common reason we still use all these methods are because different levels of purity and different raw materials show up in different contexts. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the case where the protein has never been isolated before or you have a sample (like a cell sample rich in a particular protein) then salt and sizing columns are very useful.

The present nomenclature does not allocate any specific symbol to these modified nucleotides for the following reasons. (1) The presence or absence of a given modification depends upon the location of the DNA. Sequences modified in one organism may not be modified in another. (2) Modification is usually statistical, in that only a proportion of possible sites for modification may actually be utilised in vivo. Modification of a nucleotide or base in a given polynucleotide is not a function of the sequence per se. Although it is recognised that stable RNA species (tRNA and rRNA) often carry a constant pattern of post-translational modification. the present nomenclature is not intended to overlap with or supplant existing systems. It would probably be impossible to devise a simple and logical system that avoided all conflict with previous usage. One should therefore recognise that such conflict is possible and take steps to prevent it from generating confusion, for example in relation to the symbols B, D and S, which have been recommended for 5-bromouridine, 5,6-dihydrouridine and thiouridine respectively [1], or W, which is sometimes used for wyosine.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":13485,"question_id":9427,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9427/standard-letter-for-5-methylcytosine","last_activity_date":1384431542,"creation_date":1374761700,"answer_count":3,"title":"Standard letter for 5-methylcytosine","body":"<p>I'm working on a piece of <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/melting/\">software<\/a> that computes melting temperatures for nucleic acid duplexes, and I'm about to add support for 5-methylcytosine as a nucleotide base.

I think the answer is (C) but to my mind those other two options are badly worded.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is an explanation. <\/p>\n\n<p>The classic example of isozymes is the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase\" rel=\"nofollow\">lactate dehydrogenase<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you will see if you visit the Wikipedia page the enzyme is a tetramer, and there are two subunit types, the <em>muscle<\/em> or M type and the <em>heart<\/em> or H type. Consequently there are 5 isozymes, ranging from M<sub>4<\/sub> to H<sub>4<\/sub> with all possible combinations in between. Different tissues express these two subunit types to different degrees and so are characterised by a different pattern of isozymes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The M type is encoded by the LDHA gene and the H type by the LDHB gene. I obtained the sequences of the two proteins and analysed them:<\/p>\n\n<p>LDHA: 332 amino acids; 36.7 kD; pI=8.45<\/p>\n\n<p>LDHB: 334 amino acids; 36.6 kD; pI=5.93<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see from this that the ability to separate these isozymes depends upon charge and not molecular weight. That big difference in pI (isoelectric point) means that at neutral pH the LDHA protein will carry a net positive charge while the LDHB protein will be negatively charged.

The Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology says, \"For some cells, such as electrically active nerve cells, 60 to 70 percent of the cells' energy requirement may be devoted to pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell.\"  A cardiac muscle cell, for example, would probably use more of its energy for contraction than pumping ions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a neuron, the bulk of energy expenditures are for electrical signalling done via allowing sodium and potassium ions to temporarily run DOWN their respective gradients.  As such, the \"purpose\" of a neuron is to pump ions across a membrane and then let them run back when needed.  Since a neuron doesn't really DO much else, it makes sense that the bulk of the energy produced will go towards pumping ions.  A practical example is the use of barbiturate comas to reduce metabolic activity in the brain.  Flat-lining the EEG drops metabolic requirements by ~50% (Source: Medscape).<\/p>\n\n<p>Please keep in mind that this answer is specific to neurons...other cells perform other functions, and those other functions will take up significant fractions of energy produced.  Further, other cells probably aren't devoting large fractions of their energy towards signalling, and so the fraction of energy devoted to pumping ions will be markedly less.  They'll still be pumping ions to maintain a gradient to perform tasks like membrane transport and osmotic control, but those tasks are ancillary to the \"purpose\" of those cells.  I can't find any solid numbers for Na/K ATPase energy expenditures in non-neuronal tissue at the moment, but if I do, I'll update appropriately.<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nWith regards to the question itself, which I apparently forgot to answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>Can a cell function without an appropriate membrane potential? Can co-transport run without a membrane potential?<\/p>\n","answer_id":13452,"question_id":13433,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1384269304},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef6c1e9a540c28587fe777f9bcf907af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1231/mcm","reputation":7783,"display_name":"MCM"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1384269417,"creation_date":1384269417,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does sodium-potassium pump consume about 2/3 energy of a cell ?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It's A, assuming we're talking about a cell-type that heavily utilizes the potential.<\/p>\n\n<p>On to some of the comments...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the cell isn't a neuron then there will be no processes directly collapsing the resting potential. - Alan Boyd<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Incorrect, Pacemaker cells collapse the membrane potential frequently and don't have any resting membrane potential, only hyperpolarization-repolarization cycles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Neurons are merely the most prominent users and best examples as they're entire existence is dedicated to the membrane potential.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the absence of the pump, the channels would allow a steady ion flux completely neutralizing the membrane potential from the active GHK potential to the donnan-equilibrium state This would mean (a) is the answer.

Plasmids, conjugated DNA and DNA inserted by transformation exist, and it may confer ecological advantages. Because of that, even if the enzymes would recognize only non genomic DNA and destroy it effectively, it's still more useful to have some criteria and allow to stay some alien DNA, while destroying some other.<\/p>\n\n<p>Restriction sites are pretty small, so the chances of getting one target in a viral genome is quite big. Bacterial DNA is protected by methylation, which is recognized by this enzymes and prevents them to break the DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Restriction enzymes are not the only means bacteria have in order to defend from foreign DNA. Bacteria usually carry exonucleases that recognize single stranded DNA and linear DNA, which is common in viral genomes, but not in non-infected bacterial cells. This enzyme lacks the specificity that restriction systems possess, and can work combined (for instance, a restriction cleavage may form linear DNA, which will be detected by exonucleases as potentially harmful DNA).<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, bacteria and archaeons have a special antiviral defense, named CRISPR-CAS system, that acts like an immune system. CRISPR-CAS inserts in a special region of the bacterial genome viral DNA fragments from previous infection. When a new virus infects the cell, those viral fragments are expressed as a special kind of RNA (CRISPR-RNA) which, if the virus has already infected this cell, will attach to viral DNA and will serve as a marker. Then, the RNA-marked DNA is recognized by special nucleases. This defense system allows to obtain acquired resistance that (unlike vertebrate immune system) is also inheritable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concluding, not all foreign DNA is harmful, since plasmids and other could provide some advantage to the cell. Restriction-modification systems aren't the only defense system that the bacteria has against foreign DNA, but all of them must be able to differentiate between desirable and harmful DNA. The combination of many different defense systems allow to patch the limitations of them individually, and so different species will invest differently in one or other, depending of the ecological pressures they have to face.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9818,"question_id":9815,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1376777083},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550973bfc1f6c08ff29efee9a1cc7fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":2938,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/2938/jack-aidley","reputation":3478,"display_name":"Jack Aidley"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1376743534,"creation_date":1376743534,"body":"<p>Restriction enzymes are only <em>half<\/em> of the system.

It&#39;s worth adding a historical note that this paper, and especially an earlier (1959) paper from Pardee, Jacob &amp; Monod, formed the basis of the idea of mRNA - an unstable intermediate between gene (DNA) and protein. And this in turn led to the experiments of Nirenberg that are touched upon in <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13430/proportion-of-amino-acids-from-a-random-polymer-of-u-and-c\">this question<\/a>"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1384210940,"creation_date":1384210940,"body":"<p>There are three variables being shown here: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of time samples were stored in the freezer to allow $^{32}$P decay (x-axis),<\/li>\n<li>The length of time samples were allowed to grow in a nonradioactive environment before being frozen (points with different symbols), and<\/li>\n<li>The rate of $\\beta$-galactosidase production when cells were thawed and grown in the presence of the transcriptional inducer IPTG (y-axis).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Let's break those down a bit more:<\/p>\n\n<p>The x-axis measures \"fraction of $^{32}$P decay.\" In terms of the experimental protocol, this translates to \"length of time left in the freezer.\" For the $^{32}$P-decay experiments, samples are stored in the freezer for various lengths of time, where metabolic processes, like DNA replication or enzyme production, are shut down or drastically slowed. Although metabolism has been shut down, $^{32}$P can still beta-decay into $^{31}$S (according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus-32\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>), which promotes the breakdown of any DNA containing (formerly) radioactive isotopes. The implication is that the longer you leave samples in the freezer, the more $^{32}$P will decay and the more formerly radioactive DNA will be degraded. So you can read the trend in the x-axis either as \"increasing fraction of $^{32}$P decay\", \"increasing amount of time left in freezer,\" or \"decreasing fraction of intact $z^+$ DNA.\" The different points corresponding to, say, \"48 minutes past mating\" correspond to samples that were frozen down 48 minutes past mating but kept in the freezer for different lengths of time.<\/p>\n\n<p>The y-axis measures \"percent survival of enzyme-forming capacity.\" I think that it's safe to interpret this as the rate of $\\beta$-galactosidase production relative to the rate with no $^{32}$P-decay. In other words, if you plot $\\beta$-galactosidase production over time (as in Figure 5) for different conditions, you'll measure a slope, the rate of enzyme production. If you normalize all these rates from different conditions by the rate when there was no radioactivity (and thus no degradation of $z^+$ DNA in the freezer), you'll get the values plotted on the y-axis.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final interpretation of this plot is that the $\\beta$-galactosidase production rate is sensitive to the loss of the introduced $z^+$ DNA when the loss occurs soon after mating, but if cells are allowed to grow enough to divide once or twice before DNA degradation, then the loss of the original conjugated $z^+$ DNA does not affect the $\\beta$-galactosidase production rate. This data is consistent with the idea that the DNA form of a gene is constantly required for sustained $\\beta$-galactosidase production, and after several rounds of division the $z^+$ DNA has been replicated and is no longer radioactive and prone to degradation.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's a lot of data in this plot (ah, the elegance of 1960s molecular biology!) so it can take a while to digest.

However, given @biogirl's question, it appears that there aren't many people in this field in the first place. From what I can gather, here are the reasons why I think it has been difficult to study.<\/p>\n\n<p>I. <em>The lac operon has strong polarity.<\/em> By this I mean that when the lac operon is induced, <em>lacZ<\/em> (the first gene in the operon) is translated much more than <em>lacA<\/em> (the last gene in the operon). <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4863045\" rel=\"nofollow\">Measurements<\/a> have recorded the molar ratio of $\\beta$-galactosidase : thiogalactoside transacetylase (the protein products of <em>lacZ<\/em> and <em>lacA<\/em>) upon induction of the operon at 3:1 to 5:1; i.e. when the lac operon is induced 3 to 5 molecules of $\\beta$-gal are produced for every one of the transacetylase. If you factor in the relative length of each of these proteins ($\\beta$-gal is 1024 a.a.s, transacetylase is 203), <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123418\" rel=\"nofollow\">it works out<\/a> that <em>lacZ<\/em> is being translated at least 10 times faster than <em>lacA<\/em> when the lac operon is induced. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123418\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sidney Altman's lab<\/a> has attributed this to the fact that there is a cleavage site between <em>lacY<\/em> and lacA where RNAses can cleave the nascent mRNA transcript, removing <em>lacA<\/em> from the operon and reducing the production rate of transacetylase. So it appears the cell needs quite a bit less <em>lacA<\/em> than <em>lacZ<\/em>---if indeed they need it at all, see point 2---which makes it harder to study.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4863045\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brown JL, Brown DM, Zabin I.

J Mol Biol. 339(1):31-9.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>II. lacA <em>seems to provide only a small fitness advantage under somewhat contrived conditions.<\/em> In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/789355\" rel=\"nofollow\">A paper<\/a> from the 70s researchers presented competition experiments between $lacA^{+}$ and $lacA^{-}$ strains in media with $\\beta$-galactosides as the only carbon source. For 50 generations there was no competitive advantage of one strain over the other (ratio of $lacA^{+}$ : $lacA^{-}$ stayed at 1). When after 50 generations the researchers added a lot of IPTG, a non-hydrolyzable $\\beta$-galactoside, $lacA^{+}$ outcompeted $lacA^{-}$; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29#Absolute_fitness\" rel=\"nofollow\">absolute fitness<\/a> of wild-type:mutant could be calculated to be $\\approx 1.05$. This means that the wild-type produced 105 cells for every 100 produced by the mutant. I am not a population geneticist, so I don't know if that is a large value or not. For comparison, I used to work in cyanobacterial circadian rhythms, and the absolute fitness advantage for having a circadian clock with the same period as the light-dark cycle in the environment works out to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671734\" rel=\"nofollow\">$&gt;1.11$<\/a>, which is twice as advantageous as the one reported for $lacA^{+}$ over $lacA^-$. In any case, the experimental situation in which $lacA^+$ has a competitive advantage seems rather contrived: growing with $\\beta$-galactosides as the sole carbon source with a significant amount of non-hydrolyzable analoges around gumming up the $\\beta$-galactoside metabolic machinery.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/789355\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrews KJ, Lin EC. (1976). J Bacteriol. 128(1):510-3.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>My read from these observations is that the physiological role of <em>lacA<\/em> is challenging for a biologist to untangle due to the small size of its effect on bacterial physiology. Fitness advantages of 5% may certainly be useful on evolutionary timescales, but they suggest that the benefit afforded by the enzyme will be very hard to discriminate from noise or other confounding factors in the system. The fact that <em>lacA<\/em> production is much lower than <em>lacZ<\/em> in times of lac operon induction also would make it hard to measure. <\/p>\n\n<p>A postdoc I used to work with advised me, \"don't go looking for 2-fold changes in biology,\" by which he meant don't spend too much time on questions where the size of the effect you are looking at is minor and very difficult to distinguish from noise, bias, measurement error, or other confounding variables. Obviously there are limitations to this advice; a lot can be learned from the the combination of several seemingly minor effects that have big cumulative consequences for an organism. But as a rule of thumb, it's so hard to get strong results when your effect size is so small that going after small effects is justifiable only if you have a good reason to believe there is some profound, fundamental biology behind them.

There is conflict along genes within a chromosome (example the Psr gene of Nasonia vitripennis, see R. Trivers and A. Burt <em>Genes in conflict<\/em>), along chromosome within an individual and along individual within a colony. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ants has been much studies (see E.O. Wilson, L. Keller, M. Chapuisat) and it has been found that there are tons of different reproduction system in those species. There are conflict between queens, between workers and between queen and workers to reproduce. In some species, a colony have several queens, in others, there are several queens fighting early in life for the right of being the unique queen. In some species, workers can fight to take over the queen and take her function. In some species, workers reproduce sometimes even if there is a queen. There is conflict over who will survive depending on how much related one is to the other one. For example, there is conflict over sex-ratio, the queen is as much related to her sons than to her daughters but the workers are more related to their sisters than to their brothers (because of haplo-diploidy, see Robert Trivers).<\/p>\n\n<p>There are various factors limiting the conflicts: high relatedness (Hamilton, Trivers), Cost of a fight, absence of information, power asymmetries. Ants evolved various strategy. There is a \"police\" who kill worker's spawn. We might as well consider lineage selection that select for cooperative colonies (note that L. Lehmann and L. Keller argue that group selection and kin selection are the same concept!)<\/p>\n\n<p>I basically repeated some stuff I read (or learned in class) but I am personally not sure that all that makes sense! I don't know if really the frequency of conflicts is not simply related to the mutation-selection balance. Criticisms are welcome!<\/p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:<\/p>\n\n<p>In reaction to your comment:<\/p>\n\n<p>Conflicts always have to do with reproduction or survival in evolutionary biology. One might make three categories of conflict:<\/p>\n\n<p>1)Those involving the right of reproducing<\/p>\n\n<p>2)those involving the probability of dying (I prefer not to be a forager because forager have a very high mortality)<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Those that concern the survival of kin individuals. The \"purpose\" (if I might use this agency way of speaking) of any one to to increase its inclusive fitness (Hamilton, but don't read Hamilton, there is lots of easy source of information on kin selection). Therefore, one will rather help its brother to survive rather than his cousin as it is more closely related to its brother. Similarly, beccause of the haplo-diploidy nature of sex determination system in hymenoptera, workers are more closely related to other workers than to the males while the queen is as much closely related to her daughters and sons. Therefore, we would expect a conflict over the sex ratio, queen trying to have a sex-ratio of 1:1 while the workers are trying to have a sex-ratio of 75:25 (if there is only one father).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want more specific information about sex-ratio in ants, kin selection, group selection please ask it in another post. Note that there is already some discussions one these subjects on Biology.SE. <\/p>\n","answer_id":11375,"question_id":11373,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1383923803}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11373/do-ants-within-a-colony-ever-fight-or-come-to-conflict","last_activity_date":1383923803,"creation_date":1383886462,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do ants within a colony ever fight or come to conflict?","body":"<p>I'm investigating how hierarchical groups of a larger organization with a common goal tend to come to conflict with one another over time.

The probability of 2 infrared absorption depends quadratically on the excitation intensity.

If the environment is stable and under the assumption the plasticity is associated with a intrinsic (physiological for example) cost, then a population would tend to evolve so that they always display the most optimal phenotype. I would argue that this is under the assumption that we gave enough time for the right mutations happen and under the assumptions that such mutation might exist!<\/p>\n\n<p><code>b<\/code> I don't really understand this statement. Does it mean that between two generations (which mean in one generation time) an adaptation cannot vary.\u2026in what terms? in frequency? Through time any trait vary because of selection, environment, genetic drift and mutations. And to what environment is the trait under consideration adapted for? Can we accept that the environment is changing from one generation to the other in this question? What does this question has to do with plasticity? I guess that when one says that a trait is an adaptation it means (among other things) that the population has no more variance for this trait. Therefore, only mutations would bring variations if there were no environmental change making the trait not adaptive anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p><code>c<\/code>: Well, yes. Plasticity is an adaptation to fluctuating environment. It allows to display a rather optimal phenotype in multiple different environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Answer <code>d<\/code> is wrong for sure. There is variation within a population due to genetic variance and non-adaptive environmental variance (and their interactions).

An adequate definition of fitness is hard to specify in the same way that a definition of \"species\" is hard to give. To be useful, scientific or technical definition of such broad concepets will often need to be so narrow that more than one is needed. A uselessly broad definition of fitness might be:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Fitness is modeled as a utility function, where higher fitness is indicated by a higher score\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Here every important detail about whatever's fitness is being tested, how that fitness is measured, and the environment in which that fitness is determined are simply wadded up together and transformed into a different question that is no easier to answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hypothetical problems you raise with various definitions are not (in essence) problems with the definitions, but problems with the definitions not being applicable to the domain in which such problems matter. You have to define your criteria for success, and then these constraints can be translated into a \"fitness\" function that allows the desired predictions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some issues that might matter are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are predictions about populations, or individuals.<\/li>\n<li>Are predictions about dynamic fitness (snapshot at some time) or long-run steady state fitness.<\/li>\n<li>Are predictions about quantitative values (like heights) or discrete values (like sex).<\/li>\n<li>How do you want to present error in your predictions - p value, sensitivity/specificity, confidence interval, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure this is not the kind of answer you were looking for, but I think part of your question revolves around a confusion that there is \"one\" technical definition for fitness. Part of the process of learning is comparing different presentations of the same concept, and realizing where they are different.

I go into my back garden and focus my telescope on the Moon. The surface is virtually covered with giant greenhouses, growing food to support the cities that have sprung up there. The question is: <em>what plants are they growing in those greenhouses<\/em>?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Factors such as temperature, water, soil quality etc. can be controlled easily enough if you already have the ability to build sealed greenhouses in a vacuum. There are also a number of experiments on growing food in closed systems where air and water are recycled (the Biosphere 2 project being the best known). The low gravity can't be controlled, but there have been a number of experiments on plant growth in microgravity conducted on the international space station, so growing plants in Lunar gravity should be possible. There have also been some interesting results from growing plants in an Earth-based approximation to Lunar soil.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, another important issue is the length of the Lunar day, which is 28 Earth days long, meaning that the Sun shines continuously for two Earth weeks, followed by two weeks of total darkness. I'm interested in what's known about how plants could adapt to this, but I haven't been able to find any research papers on the subject. Of course it would be possible to simulate an Earth day using artificial lighting, but the energy costs of doing this on a large scale would be rather high, so for economic reasons future Lunar farmers would likely want to keep it to a minimum.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my first question is, has any research been done on the effect of extreme changes in day length on plant growth?<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, is there any type of food plant that would be particularly likely to cope with such an environment (perhaps with some suitable genetic modifications)? For example, would normal crop plants such as cereals be able to build up enough sugar reserves in two weeks to survive the next two weeks in total darkness?

Strong selection can drive alleles to fixation. Secondly, if the kale has come from a small sub-population of the wild cabbage it may have been through a genetic bottleneck, this is likely to reduce allelic diversity because, unless all alleles from the original population are captured in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">founder populations<\/a>, some alleles will be lost by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>2 <strong>Generally allelic diversity is a \"good\" thing in an unstable environment.<\/strong> It allows different trait combinations and variation in traits to occur. If the environment changes drastically then it could impose severe selective forces on the population, those with high allelic diversity are likely to come up with a combination of alleles that survives. <\/p>\n\n<p>E.g. Humans only allow the cabbages over 18cm in diameter to reproduce in to the next generation. 5 loci affect cabbage size, each having a \"large cabbage\" (C) allele and a \"small cabbage\" (c) allele. Having 5 c alleles gives a cabbage size of 15cm. Each C allele adds 1cm. If a population has fixed the c allele at 3 loci (i.e. there is low genetic diversity) then none of the cabbages will be >18cm. If a population has both the C and c allele at all loci then some of the population will be over 18cm.<\/p>\n\n<p>3 <strong>The final question is difficult to answer,<\/strong> it depends on what you define as \"a good recommendation,\"  that is very subjective. If the aim is to maximize allelic diversity then yes, if it is to maximize cabbage size it is probably no (because the \"genetically engineered\" plants have been selected upon for large cabbages - they might have the C alleles fixed in the populations!)<\/p>\n","answer_id":11329,"question_id":11328,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1383679650}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11328/genetic-variation-and-sensitivity-of-wild-cabbage","last_activity_date":1383721528,"creation_date":1383669850,"answer_count":1,"title":"Genetic variation and sensitivity of wild cabbage","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>1: Is it true that the genetic variation of kale plants is smaller\n  than wild cabbage?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think so, because of human selection of the kale plants.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2: Are broccoli and cauliflower more sensitive to changing\n  environmental conditions than wild cabbage?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think so, because domesticated crops have a lower genetic diversity than wild varieties.

We can recognize this as a particular case of the <em>Gamma distribution<\/em>, with PDF:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$f_{\\mathrm{Gamma}}(t\\,\\big|\\,k,\\theta)\\propto t^{k-1}e^{-t/\\theta}.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>In particular, $h(t)$ looks like the PDF of a $\\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\\tau)$ random variable,\n$$h(t)\\propto f_{\\mathrm{Gamma}}(t\\,\\big|\\,2,\\tau)\\propto te^{-t/\\tau}.$$<\/p>\n\n<p>So the authors of the paper are claiming that the burst duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{burst}}$ is a random variable with a $\\mathrm{Gamma}(2,70\\,\\mathrm{ sec})$ distribution.<\/p>\n\n<p>How do we get from that to \"This distribution was consistent with two rate-limiting stochastic steps?\"\nIf we recall from our stats class (or look up properties of the Gamma distribution on Wikipedia), a Gamma distribution with integer values of $k$ is <em>the distribution of the waiting time for $k$ events to occur in a Poisson process.<\/em> The setup of a Poisson process is that you are tracking the occurrence of unlikely/infrequent events in time, so the fact that the distribution $h(t)$ of burst times looks like a $\\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\\tau)$ suggests that the burst duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{burst}}$ is determined by the occurrence of 2 stochastic events (with the same \"frequency\" $1/\\tau$). In other words, this distribution is consistent with the following scenario: a nuclear localization occurs, and then will stop after two particular events, where the timing of the events is governed by a Poisson process (which, as WYSIWYG pointed out, is a reasonable model for the occurrence of chemical reactions with reasonably slow kinetics, i.e. you can count individual reactions in time). If this is true, the distribution of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{burst}}$ will look like $te^{-t/\\tau}$.<\/p>\n\n<p>The authors generalize that statement somewhat by saying that technically there could be more events/reactions required to terminate a localization burst, but all but 2 of those reactions happen extremely rapidly, i.e. there are 2 rate-limiting steps in the decision process (both of which happen to have the same value for $\\tau$).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: I realized that one more mathematical point might make this more clear: The statement about the Gamma distribution and Poisson processes above is equivalent to the statement that the sum of $k$ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iid\" rel=\"nofollow\">iid<\/a> random variables with distribution $\\mathrm{Exponential}(\\tau)$ is a random variable with a $\\mathrm{Gamma}(k,\\tau)$ distribution. Thus $h(t)$ is literally (up to normalization) the distribution of a sum of 2 independent exponential random variables.

The fascicular phloem (FP) is the main transport conduit, and more closely resembles the phloems of other plant families. Its role is to transport photosynthates and other nutrients (Turgeon &amp; Oparka, 2010).The extra fascicular phloem (EFP), is more minor and has an atypical composition for a phloem. Although we have been aware of this dual phloem system for centuries (Crafts, 1932; Fischer, 1883, 1884, 1886), it is often ignored!!<\/p>\n\n<p>The minor strands of EFP have been found to be the source of the extreme bleeding observed in cucurbits (Zhang <em>et al<\/em>., 2010). However this excessive bleeding has meant that cucurbits are a very popular model plant for phloem composition studies, since copious amounts of phloem contents are easily accessible. This is problematic since we now know that the exudate originates from the atypical EFP strands, making it a poor model (maybe is isn't even a phloem at all)!<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason that the EFP does not block upon wounding is that it lacks blocking and sealing mechanisms (such as P proteins and pectins), which usually exist in order to protect the phloem from damage or disease, and to prevent the loss of vital metabolites. The fact that these are not present in EFP, along with the fact that EFP is rich in defensive proteins (Walz <em>et al<\/em>., 2004), may suggest a defensive role for this secondary phloem. Its anatomical placement around the vital vascular transport conduits supports this idea.<\/p>\n\n<h2><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NF0qV.jpg\" alt=\"The dual phloem system found in cucurbits\"><\/h2>\n\n<p>*No others are known, but could definitely exist.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Crafts, A.

Off the top of my hat I can try to pinpoint a few fallacies in your theory:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Scaling of the body happens in three dimensions and thus to a power law. As such allometric equations have to be applied when dealing with the total amount of substance in the body. Different species have different correlation factors of body mass to total substance amounts.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels) is affected by Allometry (the relationship of body size to the 'biology')<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Diffusion factors are similar in closely related species. This means in order for messenger molecules with a short acting range/half-life (e.g. nitric oxide), the total amount in the animal may indeed be likely higher and the messenger in question may be produced on-site (e.g. endothelium). Testosterone as the name indicates, is however produced in the testes and released in the blood stream.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The sensitivity and regulation of the receptors themselves (which react to a substance) can be different in different species. It may also be weakly responsive to begin with at the genetic and ultimately the folded protein level. A good example of that is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_1_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">melanocortin receptor MC1R<\/a> in a gross section of the white human population. Even if you were to produce the same level of melanotonin, the melanocytes wouldn't respond to the same degree as in Humans with darker skin.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Messenger molecules can be re-purposed and take over or be given additional roles and functions over evolutionary-time. Again, Melatonin may serve here as an example.<br>\nAfter all a given messenger is already evolutionary tested, especially in regard to cross-talk, Haptens, and other adverse molecular interactions in the animal species and comes with the full set of molecular machinery adapted to it, - a \"luxury\" a new messenger doesn't have. As such pressure usually exists to re-use given messengers.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like, in animals, does testosterone correlate with size, possibly\n  explaining why a lion is heaps more slender, muscular, fit, agile,\n  aggressive, and vicious than a typical human?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I doubt you will find typical humans or typical human populations from a biological perspective.

As to which concerted molecular messengers make the \"evolutionary cut\", by best influencing an animals behavior in its given \"time-domain\" is another question. As the question is complex much is still researched.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take this counter-example: A mouse and an elephant have very different masses resulting in different inertial forces. Fleeing from an enemy will take different strategies in regard to the central nervous system as well as the body, and demand different levels of messenger molecules at different places, at different times for both animals.

The lipid bilayer is a large sea of hydrophobic interactions that essentially prevents any ion from crossing. As a result, Na<sup>+<\/sup> and K<sup>+<\/sup> concentrations remain constant and different on the cytoplasmic side and the extracellular side. However, ions can pass through ion channels like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel\" rel=\"nofollow\">K<sup>+<\/sup> channel<\/a>. It is important to understand that in K<sup>+<\/sup> channels, only K<sup>+<\/sup> can pass and these channels are actually selective against Na<sup>+<\/sup> (answer to question 1).<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two potentials at work here. First is a chemical potential created by the flux of K<sup>+<\/sup> from high K<sup>+<\/sup> to low K<sup>+<\/sup>. The second is a counteracting membrane potential created by a charge imbalance. Note, that the swapping of a few ions will <strong>a)<\/strong> result in a negligible change in the concentration ie. the chemical potential, <strong>b)<\/strong> result in a large change in the membrane potential. At some point, the flux out due to the chemical potential and the flux in due to the membrane potential will be equilvant and the cell will reach a <strong>resting potential<\/strong> otherwise known at the <strong>Nernst potential<\/strong> or <strong>equilibrium potential<\/strong> (technically a steady state).<\/p>\n\n<p>When a cell depolarizes by closing these channels, the local charge will quickly go back to an equilibrium or a non-charged state.<\/p>\n\n<p>So why K<sup>+<\/sup> rather than Na<sup>+<\/sup>? For typical cells, the extracellular concentration of Na<sup>+<\/sup> is 145 mM and cytoplasmic is 12 mM. For K<sup>+<\/sup>, it is 4 mM and 155 mM respectively. Doing the appropriate calculations of the Nerst potential, for Na<sup>+<\/sup> it is +67 mV and for K<sup>+<\/sup> it is -98 mV. Qualitatively we can see that this would result in vastly different things.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of this information can be found from Pollard and Earnshaw's <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0721639976\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cell Biology<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":2501,"question_id":2499,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1383308130}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2499/understanding-membrane-resting-potential-from-the-perspective-of-ions","last_activity_date":1383308130,"creation_date":1338868965,"answer_count":1,"title":"Understanding Membrane / Resting Potential from the perspective of ions?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>From wikipedia article <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">RESTING potential<\/a>: \"there is no actual measurable charge excess in either side.
