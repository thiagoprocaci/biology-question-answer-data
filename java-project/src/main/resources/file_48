It sends it's secretions to the eye via the lacrimal duct. Tears secreted collect in the conjunctiva of the upper lid. There is also a nasolacrimal duct which drains the tears from the eye into the nasal cavity. Hence the sniffles when we cry.<\/p>\n\n<p>How is it controlled? The lacrimal nucleus in the brain is the major source for innervating the lacrimal gland, is a subnucleus of the superior salivary nucleus in the tegmentum of the pons (part of the brain stem). The lacrimal nucleus is connected to the lacrimal gland by the facial nerve (more specifically the greater petrosal nerve). This is parasympathetic (meaning it is part of the autonomic nervous sytem) and the neurotransmitter transmitting the signal from nerve to gland is acetylcholine (the receptor is muscarinic subtype of the cholinergic... though strangely wikipedia says nicotinic subtype is involved as well, but maybe this is simply poorly worded and is just refering to the ganglia stopover between pre/post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons), this information helps explain how some drugs affect lacrimation (tearing up).<\/p>\n\n<p>Taken from source (1) [I do not know how reliable this website is]: How is the lacrimal nucleus told to start lacrimation? The lacrimal nucleus receives projections from the autonomic nervous system as well as from various brain structures, including the frontal lobe, globus pallidus, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The projections from the frontal lobe are thought to be important in human psychic lacrimation (crying because of emotions). <\/p>\n\n<p>What I know: Another brain area called the limbic system is involved in production of basic emotional drives, such as anger, fear, etc. The limbic system, to be specific, the hypothalamus, also has a degree of control over the autonomic system. As I under stand it, the frontal lobe usually inhibits the limbic system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again from source (1): While humans across the world produce psychic tears in response to both positive and negative emotions, and while similar emotions have been identified in other animal species, no reports exist of other animals showing psychic lacrimation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Comparent to tearing for physical reasons,  tears for emotional reasons have s different chemical composition. They are composed of more protein-based hormones, such as prolactin, adrenocorticotropic, and leucine enkephalin (a natural pain killer), which is suggested to be the mechanism behind the experience of crying from emotion making an individual feel better.<\/p>\n\n<p>sources:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) <a href=\"http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/lacrimation-tearing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/lacrimation-tearing<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(2) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland#Innervation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland#Innervation<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>(3) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":35010,"question_id":34988,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1433728991}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34988/why-does-our-eyes-got-wet-when-we-feel-emotional-or-whenever-we-are-hurt","last_activity_date":1433728991,"creation_date":1433693791,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does our eyes got wet when we feel emotional or whenever we are hurt?","body":"<p>I was thinking like whenever when we feel emotional or whenever we got hurt we got tears from our eyes but why is that happen ?

Of course, it is hard to prove a negative. But here are my arguments: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Logic. there is little reason for this to happen. A culinary fruit is supposed to be sweet, and plants tend to store sugars in their botanical fruits, not in other parts (although by this logic, there should be tuber-fruits too). <\/li>\n<li>Source checking. I went through two books intended as comprehensive reference works in the kitchen, <em>The professional chef<\/em> and <em>McGee On Food and Cooking<\/em>. They don't list a (culinary) fruit which I could identify as a botanical non-fruit, with one contentious case. Note that <em>On Food and cooking<\/em>'s chapter on vegetables is structured according to plant part, and it has a subchapter called \"fruits used as vegetables\" - but it does not have a chapter of \"vegetables used as fruit\" or similar. <\/li>\n<li>Language. People tend to mix up the two categories of \"culinary fruit\" and \"botanical fruit\" until the difference is pointed out to them. While they don't follow the correct botanical definition of fruit, a plant part seems to have to check the \"used by the plant for reproduction\" check box to be called a fruit, to the point where many words related to \"fruit\" evoke a harvest-like image such as \"to come to fruition\", or also words for \"barren\" in many languages which literally translate to \"without fruit\", e.g. the German <em>unfruchtbar<\/em>. So even when a food fulfills the \"plant part\" and \"sweet snack\" criteria, it is not called a fruit if it's not (commonly perceived as) a seed container. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The contentious case coming from the books is rhubarb. <em>The professional chef<\/em> lists it as a fruit, while McGee calls it \"a tart stand-in for fruit\" in the vegetable chapter, and mentions it again in the fruit chapter, as \"a vegetable that often masquerades as a fruit\". Kitchen terminology is by no means standardized, so if you were to question random cooks about rhubarb categorization, I guess you'd get a mixture of \"a fruit\" , \"a vegetable\" and \"I don't know\" answers. <\/p>\n\n<p>An idea I had while writing the answer: maybe you can count ginger. Ginger has many uses in the kitchen, but it is available as a candied snack, which is else only common for fruit. McGee lists it as a spice, although he explicitly speaks of \"the dried spice\" without giving a category for the fresh rhizome. I think most cooks won't dub ginger \"a fruit\" but would be willing to include candied ginger in a bowl of mixed candied fruit. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some petals and leaves are also made into jams, which would support a fruit categorization. Nevertheless, I've never heard of them being referred to as fruits. Prominent examples are rose petals, violet petals and verbena leaves (although one could argue that preserving verbena produces a herb jelly, not a jam). <\/p>\n\n<p>This answer encompasses Western cooking traditions. It is possible that other cuisines have a different view of what a \"fruit\" is - for example aloe is frequently used in sweet preparations, maybe the leaf flesh is eaten as fruit somewhere. <\/p>\n\n<p>So in the end, it comes mostly to your willingness to stretch the definition of a culinary fruit. It is certainly not the case for the most commonly eaten fruits.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34991,"question_id":34984,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1433700481}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34984/are-there-any-culinary-fruits-that-are-not-botanically-fruits-or-accessory-fruit","last_activity_date":1433700481,"creation_date":1433679104,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any culinary fruits that are not botanically fruits or accessory fruits?","body":"<p>Many culinary vegetables are botanically fruits.

It also is believed to have anticholinergic, central antidiuretic, antiarrhythmic, muscle relaxant, antidepressant (possibly through blockade of norepinephrine release), sedative, and neuromuscular-blocking properties (<a href=\"http://www.drugbank.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drug bank<\/a>).

This is fascinating stuff."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433522358,"creation_date":1433521934,"body":"<p>One thing to remember when you uproot a plant is that some of the smallest structures break off most readily. What you will usually see after uprooting the plant are the largest parts of the root structure, but there are often smaller parts which have broken off.<\/p>\n\n<p>Root structure is highly variable, but the general idea is that one or more primary trunk-like roots strike out toward the most important water sources, and from those primary roots, smaller roots branch out to more broadly extend the reach of the root system. Depending on the size of the plant, there may be several levels of branching, just like you might find in the top of the plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, the nutrients that the roots need to absorb come to the plant with the water. They become dissolved in the water and the roots receive them along with the water. Dirt is chunky, not usually homogenous. So there may be more of the nutrients a plant needs in one area than another, or water may flow more easily through one area than another. The roots are able to grow in the direction of what they need, which is why you will occasionally find strong roots actually breaking into plumbing to get at your water. Mostly, it is water that they seek out, because the nutrients are dissolved in the water, but the plant may also show preference for a more nutrient rich stream over a larger, cleaner water source. The roots seek out what the plants need over the long term as they grow in one direction or another. For many plants, by the way, this means a simple strategy of simply growing straight down (a tap root), because that's almost always where they find more water with more of the right stuff dissolved into it. This is similar to the fact that many plants grow as tall as they can because that's where they will find the most sunlight, though the general idea is to grow leaves wherever that light might be captured.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wherever the primary roots land themselves, the smaller root branches extend into the space to absorb as much as they can. They have to be greedy, because there may be days or even weeks when the ground gets very dry, so they have to get while the getting is good.

Selection (Natural Selection for example) is one of such process. Genetic drift is another such process. So, evolution don't select viruses. Viruses are selected and therefore evolution occurs. When saying \"viruses are selected\", it means some viruses have a higher fitness (fitness is a function of both survival and reproductive success) than others. So your title doesn't make any sense.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Species interactions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Generalities<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Species interact. Species actually interact a lot. One can classify species interactions into categories. Here is a table of possible biological interactions (comes from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_interaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki<\/a>), where a <code>+<\/code> indicates \"beneficial\", a <code>-<\/code> indicates \"detrimental\" and a <code>0<\/code> indicates it has no effect on fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PG9hr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Note about symbiosis<\/em> - comes in reaction to @Gerhard's comment<\/p>\n\n<p>Different authors use the word <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">symbiosis<\/a><\/em> differently. From wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The definition of symbiosis is controversial among scientists. Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it should apply to any type of persistent biological interaction (i.e. mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic).<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">6<\/a> After 130+ years of debate,<a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34953/are-there-examples-of-now-living-species-where-one-is-descended-from-the-other/34956#34956\">7<\/a> current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter \"de Bary\" definition or an even broader definition (i.e. symbiosis = all species interactions), with the restrictive definition no longer used (i.e. symbiosis = mutualism)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Blurry limits<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Generalities<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It may seem pretty obvious that two species should have either one type or another type of interaction. However, the reality is often more complicated than that. An interaction might fall under one set of environmental conditions and fall under another category under another set of environmental conditions. In addition to that, it is not uncommon that due to selection on the host genes due to the presence of a parasite, the host evolve so to tolerate the presence of the parasite up to the point of actually having a lower fitness in the absence of the parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Example<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Parasites often have different life cycle of alternance of generation. That is a parasite sometimes need several hosts such as the parasite causing malaria for example that need both mosquitoes and a primate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider for example a snail which is infected by a parasite. Let's assume (I think it is a real world example but I am too lazy to find out a reference) that the parasite need the snail to be eaten in order to reproduce in the body of the predator. In order to improve the chance of its host to be eaten the parasite is selected so to diminish the thickness of the snail's shell. In response to that, there is selection (which intensity depend also on the proportion of infected snails in the population) for having thicker shells. But now, snails that are not infected have shells that are so thick that the can't move as fast as they'd need to forage. So, by the end infected snails may have a higher fitness than non-infected snails. And therefore the interaction between the snail and its parasite is not a parasitic interaction anymore but a mutualistic interaction.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can viruses have non-parasitic relationship with their host?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Well... why not? There is nothing so fundamental about viruses that would prevent them to have mutualistic relationship with their host. Actually I am aware of a few relationships. For example, female <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid_wasp\" rel=\"nofollow\">parasitoid wasps<\/a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid\" rel=\"nofollow\">parasitoids<\/a>: parasite that kill their host). parasitoid wasps lay their egg in other insects larvea (host), the egg (and later the larvea I thing) develop in the larvea (host), eat the larvea (host) and once the host is dead, the individual metamorphose to its adult form and fly away to find a mate a parasite the next larvea. Those wasps sometimes have viruses in their ovary that infect the host to reduce the immune defence of the host to protect the growth of their egg. This is an example of mutualistic relationship between the wasp and the virus. However I am not quite sure whether the virus is not totally part of the genome of the wasp and detach from it only in the ovary. If this is the case, there might just have a slight semantic.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sequencing to know if the plants are infected<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You said<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>they collect samples of plants and somehow by analyzing their DNA notice that these plants are all infected by some kind of virus<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Most likely, they make a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">PCR<\/a> (amplification of DNA, that is increasing the number of copies of a given DNA sequence) on viral DNA and look for a signal. In other words they are not sequencing (=reading) the plant DNA but only seeking for viral DNA. If they find viral DNA, then the plant is infected if not, the plant is not infected.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is unclear to me from your text<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>From your post, it is unclear to me yet how your \"family member\" plans to decide the type of interaction there are between viruses and plants. Knowing the frequency of infected plants won't tell you much about the interaction between the plant and the virus.<\/p>\n\n<p>They will likely have to make growth experiment and try to measure the fitness of infected and non-infected plants.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong> - Following the first comment<\/p>\n\n<p>Knowing that every plant individual is infected doesn't tell much of the virulence of the virus. The frequency of infected is not an information that can help understand the \"type of biological interaction\" (paratism, mutualism, etc..). One will need to actually make growth experiment and measure fitness (or measure phenotypic traits that are known to be good proxy for fitness).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One question about your answer is : can we really speak of a virus as a species and especially does your table really apply in this situation ?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The concept of species is not a natural category. It is a man-made, unclear, sometimes useful, category. Typically, it is hard to even talk of species for organisms that don't have sexual reproduction (which is the case of viruses). I wrote <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34953/are-there-examples-of-now-living-species-where-one-is-descended-from-the-other/34956#34956\">this other answer<\/a> today about the concept of species, you may want to read it. <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11240/transitivity-of-species-definitions\">Here<\/a> is another post on the subject. Btw, talking about semantic issue, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9438/why-isnt-a-virus-alive\">viruses are often not considered as alive<\/a>. All those semantic issues don't have any impact on our understanding of biological processes.<\/p>\n\n<p>But yes, the table applies to viruses as well. This table is indifferent to the concept of species. Consider just two genotypes (two individuals), one plant and one virus, the existence of the virus has (or has not) an impact on the fitness of the plant (and vice-verse) and therefore, you can classify the relationship between those two genotypes (individuals) into one category of the table. As a reminder, the nature of those relationship may depend on the environment. Typically, a photosynthetic endosymbiote might be very beneficial to the \"host\" if there is some sunlight but might be quite detrimental in the absence of sun light.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34967,"question_id":34964,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1433619140}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34964/viruses-selected-by-evolution","last_activity_date":1433619140,"creation_date":1433609620,"answer_count":1,"title":"Viruses selected by evolution","body":"<p>First let me apologize in advance for I know almost nothing about biology.

Let me restate the solution to the problem first.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Resolution of the problem<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As you said the frequency of sick people $\\frac{1}{300} = 2pq + q^2$ in this case, where $q = 1-p$ is the frequency of the (dominant) allele causing the disease. It is a simple quadratic equation with one unknown so one doesn't even need to make any approximation to solve for $q$ (or for $p$).

The procedure for incompatibility grouping is based on the introduction, by conjugation or transformation, of a plasmid of an \"unknown\" Inc group into a strain carrying a plasmid of a known Inc group. If the resident plasmid is eliminated in the progeny, the incoming plasmid is assigned to its same Inc group (Datta and Hedges, 1971). Plasmids with the same replication control are \"incompatible\", whereas plasmids with different replication controls are \"compatible\". On this basis two plasmids belonging to the same Inc group cannot be propagated in the same cell line (Datta and Hughes, 1983; Couturier et al., 1988). Inc group identification has been frequently used to classify plasmids. The method has been an important tool to trace the diffusion of plasmids conferring antimicrobial resistance and also to follow the evolution and spread of emerging plasmids (Anderson et al., 1977).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.einsten.net/pdf/3120251550.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">synopsis<\/a> of the Datta &amp; Hedges article sited above:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Classification<\/strong>\n  In 1971, Hedges and Datta proposed a plasmid classification scheme based on the stability of plasmids during conjugation (incompatibility). The first incompatibility (Inc) groups were IncI, IncN, IncF, and IncP. Currently, 26 Inc groups are recognized in Enterobacteriaceae including six IncF (FII to VII) and three IncI (I1, Iγ, I2) variants. Major plasmid families occurring in Enterobacteriaceae are HI2, HI1, I1-γ, X, L/M, N, FIA, FIB, FIC, W, Y, P, A/C, T, K, B/O, FII, FIII, FIV. IncF plasmids are low- copy-number plasmids, often carrying more than one replicon with at least one replicon strongly conserved.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>One way to think about it is: if one prepares a plasmid cloning vector to accept foreign inserts, and ligates in a \"shotgun\" collection of fragments from some DNA of interest. After transformation, selection and growth on plates, none of the colonies whose plasmids carry inserts <strong><em>ever<\/em><\/strong> contain more than one unique plasmid.  In other words, it may be possible for two different inserts to be inserted during ligation into the same vector backbone, but it is not possible to find a single pure colony that contains cells harbouring two different plasmids, each carrying a different insert. <\/p>\n\n<p>If a cell gets transformed by two different plasmids from the same <em>inc<\/em> group only one plasmid will \"win.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Examples of compatible <em>ori<\/em>'s commonly encountered:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pMB9 (pBR322, pUC, etc., etc.,)<\/li>\n<li>F (fosmids)<\/li>\n<li>bacteriophage lambda (some cosmids)<\/li>\n<li>bacteriophage M13 and relatives (also yields ssDNA phage useful for Sanger sequencing)<\/li>\n<li>bacteriophage P1<\/li>\n<li>pSC101<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Here is a nice <a href=\"http://blog.addgene.org/plasmid-101-origin-of-replication\" rel=\"nofollow\">table<\/a>, but I cannot vouch for its accuracy.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34930,"question_id":34927,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1433508255}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34927/transformation-of-e-coli-cells","last_activity_date":1433508255,"creation_date":1433445186,"answer_count":2,"title":"Transformation of E.coli cells","body":"<p>As a team of undergraduate researchers we are looking to transform two genes of interest into our competent E.coli cells.

Years ago, I worked on some computational and search algorithms which used a growth factor to determine how far to widen a search space, or how much more memory to allocate. For some of these algorithms, I ran a series of random trials to search for an optimal growth factor and found that for some, that optimal factor approached 1.618. Completely outside the realm of biology, this golden mean popped up as the most efficient growth factor for some of my algorithms.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the years since then, I have recognized that this is an optimal factor for various engineering problems (although in practice I often find it more trouble than it's worth to explain to colleagues why they want to use it). So, I have gradually come to believe that this is why we see this ratio all over nature, in the way seashells grow, the proportions of various body parts, the arrangement of seed structures, etc. It appears that natural processes have ultimately led various lifeforms all over our world to tend toward this ratio to optimize their own functions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fact that we find this ratio \"beautiful\" is a far more fascinating study of what appears to be a meta-adaptation. Consider all of the various ways that the recognition of this ratio is important beyond just sexual reproduction. When we select our food, choosing vegetable or meat specimens which exhibit this ratio most perfectly is more likely to lead us to the healthiest food. Choosing to take shelter under the more \"beautiful\" tree may also be a good bet that it is the more stable, healthy tree. Making tools, clothing, or structures with this ratio may serendipitously lead us to better formed products. We don't have to find this ratio more beautiful to look at, but because we do, it leads us to better choices in a variety of odd ways. So, those of us whose brains appreciate these things thrive a little more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your question was not about underlying causes, but about statistical prevalence. I don't know the answer to that. And I think it would be very difficult to obtain those numbers accurately for another loosely related reason. The human brain is very attuned to finding patterns, <em>and<\/em> the human brain likes to find this ratio. Taken together, this presents a huge bias for any researcher trying to objectively measure the frequency of this ratio in nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, once we understand that this ratio is the solution to a variety of engineering problems, it becomes clear that it is an indicator of optimization, or proximity to perfection. And even if we cannot say how many species are able to recognize, appreciate, and seek after this ratio, we can say that those who do will most likely find it a beneficial adaptation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34929,"question_id":34925,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34925/is-the-golden-ratio-of-anatomic-measurements-universally-beneficial-for-sexual-r","last_activity_date":1433451063,"creation_date":1433435523,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is the golden ratio of anatomic measurements universally beneficial for sexual reproduction?","body":"<p>It is often claimed, in popular media, that the golden ratio (Fibonacci series) in for example some face measurements is aesthetically (and hence reproductively) attractive with respect to the humans.

In resting muscle it is present at about 5x the level of ATP.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Levels of ATP are also used by cells as a regulatory input - in other words the fall in ATP levels with the onset of exercise triggers a response to replenish ATP through e.g. the breakdown of glycogen. In this view it is useful to have a final stage \"energy currency\" which can act directly as an enzyme substrate and whose level is a sensitive indicator of current energy demand.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) ATP is also a substrate for RNA polymerase. If ATP was present at vastly higher levels than UTP, CTP and GTP it would probably cause errors in transcription, and might also interfere with the regulatory role of GTP binding proteins, since it would act as a competitor for binding at the GTP binding site.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) In any case, if ATP was to be maintained at a much higher concentration for rapid use, presumably as soon as it began to be used the ATP generating systems would have to start up to try to replenish the pool.

In humans these are produced in the liver when the amount of acetoacetyl CoA being produced exceeds the capacity of the TCA cycle. These acetyl groups are instead used to produce acetoacetate, and this can be reduced to &beta;-hydroxybutyrate. <\/p>\n\n<p>The production of significant amounts of ketones occurs during fasting (diabetic ketosis will not be considered here). Once glycogen has run out, the bodies requirement for glucose has to be met by gluconeogenesis (mainly in the liver) - glucose is synthesised from various carbon skeletons including glycerol and the products of amino acid catabolism (coming from muscle protein turnover). This means that in the liver the function of the TCA cycle shifts almost entirely to supplying oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis, via the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Thus there is no oxaloacetate available for citrate synthase, so acetyl CoA cannot enter the TCA cycle. However, because fasting also results in fat mobilisation the level of acetyl CoA in liver cells goes up (acetyl CoA is the end product of fatty acid breakdown). <\/p>\n\n<p>So what is going on here? During fasting the fuel economy of the body has to switch from being heavily glucose-based to one which uses carbon from fat and from protein. The ketones are the manifestation of this, and many tissues become heavy users of ketones during fasting as blood levels rise to 5 mM within a few days. This means that the glucose being produced by the liver can be directed towards tissues which are more dependent upon glucose. The classic example of such a tissue is the brain, but in humans even the brain begins to use ketones heavily during fasting.<\/p>\n\n<p>In ruminants the situation is entirely different. Ruminants rely upon the bacteria in the rumen to metabolise carbohydrate in their diet and this results in large amounts of alimentary ketones entering the blood directly. For their glucose supply ruminants rely entirely upon gluconeogenesis, and the substrate for this is propionate, another end product of bacterial metabolism in the rumen: a lactating dairy cow will synthesise over 3 kg of glucose per day.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, when I read this question my reaction was that the statement must be incorrect - surely it would make sense for sheep to use ketones in all tissues. However my intuition was wrong - according to <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pell JM.&amp; Bergmane N(1983) Cerebral metabolism of amino acids and glucose in fed and fasted sheep. Am. J. Physiol. 244: E282-E289<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>cited in <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heitmann RN <em>et al.<\/em> (1987) Hepatic ketogenesis and peripheral ketone body utilization in the ruminant.

Nutrition 117: 1174-1180<\/p>\n  \n  <p>\"Although there is some oxidation of ketone bodies by the brain tissues of humans and rats during prolonged fasting, Pell and Bergman ,using an elegant in vivo preparation, have shown no significant uptake or oxidation of ketone bodies by sheep brain.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't have access to the Pell &amp; Bergmane paper so I cannot explain what they actually did. What is clear from the review by Heitmann <em>et al<\/em>. however is that fasting ruminants respond in the same way that we do, switching to hepatic ketogenesis, and presumably they also maintain gluconeogenesis, using not propionate, but amino acid carbon skeletons. The context of the statement quoted above suggests that even in the fasted state the sheep brain doesn't use ketones.<\/p>\n","answer_id":11359,"question_id":10380,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1383806855}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10380/are-the-brains-of-any-herbivorous-animals-capable-of-utilising-ketone-bodies-as","last_activity_date":1433418545,"creation_date":1378876619,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are the brains of any herbivorous animals capable of utilising ketone bodies as an energy source?","body":"<p>I ask this question because earlier today I heard from a lecturer at my university that a sheep's brain cannot utilise ketone bodies as an energy source and hence with insufficient glucose supply for their brains they die. <\/p>\n","question_id":10380,"tags":["bioenergetics","diet","lipids"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":251,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1433418545},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/912e6e76dbf125c9793eb61fd601ff4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4473,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4473/john","reputation":1,"display_name":"John"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":0,"post_id":10443,"edited":false,"creation_date":1379257151,"comment_id":13808,"body":"Please tag this as homework question."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3615,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3615/biogirl","reputation":3923,"display_name":"biogirl","accept_rate":89},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/912e6e76dbf125c9793eb61fd601ff4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":4473,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4473/john","reputation":1,"display_name":"John"},"score":0,"post_id":10445,"edited":false,"creation_date":1379258201,"comment_id":13809,"body":"I understand the matter portion but, the energy can be lost as heat?

The general theme is that the amine nitrogen is first removed by a transaminase to yield a keto-acid, which is when converted into a carbohydrate that can enter the TCA cycle. To give but one example, leucine is converted in the mitochondrion by a series of CoA-coupled intermediates into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate (a ketone body; see below).

Effects begin less than an hour after\n  consumption, and a moderate dose usually wears off in about five\n  hours.[13]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Caffeine has a number of effects on sleep, but does not affect all\n  people in the same way.

Some evidence suggests that coffee does not produce the\n  ergogenic effects observed in other caffeine sources.[19] High doses\n  of caffeine, however, can impair athletic performance by interfering\n  with coordination.[20] There is also evidence that caffeine may be\n  helpful at high altitude.[21]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Stimulant_effects\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia - Caffeine<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>1980 - <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7369170\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caffeine and coffee: their influence on metabolic rate and substrate utilization in normal weight and obese individuals.<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2010 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938410000703\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green tea catechins, caffeine and body-weight regulation<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>1985 - <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/4079741\" rel=\"nofollow\">Influence of caffeine on the resting metabolic rate of exercise-trained and inactive subjects.<\/a> <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2004 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2004.144/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Effect of a Dietary Herbal Supplement Containing Caffeine and Ephedra on Weight, Metabolic Rate, and Body Composition<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2006 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938406000540\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metabolic effects of spices, teas, and caffeine<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2004 - <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v75/n4/abs/clpt2004404a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enhanced Stimulant and Metabolic Effects of Combined Ephedrine and Caffeine<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2006 - <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/3/674.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Changes in caffeine intake and long-term weight change in men and women<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":23699,"question_id":23697,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1415160321},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":8,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":23708,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415164864,"comment_id":37406,"body":"+1 for the elaborate answer :-)"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":23708,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"edited":false,"creation_date":1415174706,"comment_id":37414,"body":"Thanks @inf3no !"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/711e0698cb761a0ccc30d9caf8092f54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10048,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10048/alec","reputation":128,"display_name":"Alec"},"score":0,"post_id":23708,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415184137,"comment_id":37439,"body":"Excellent answer.

Most notably, adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release in various brain structures including the acetylcholine release in the mesopontine projection neurons. Caffeine blocks these adenosine receptors, in turn leading to an increase in acetylcholine release in the cortex and hippocampus. This increases vigilance and information processing. Increased acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex may lead to increased attentional abilities. Adenosine also inhibits the effects of dopamine released by the striatium, ultimately leading to disinhibition of motor output in the brainstem.

That lamp uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence\">bioluminescence<\/a> and not electric power. Normally living cells don't like to give you energy. The trick we use is anaerob fermentation. Without the presence of oxygen (good electron acceptor) they cannot extract more energy from compounds like ethanol, etc... so they get rid of them. After that we can \"burn\" these compounds with oxygen and get a lot of energy. So currently there is no solution which uses sunlight and microbes to produce electricity directly, however it might be possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many ways to use photosynthesis in order to produce energy.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The simplest way to burn the plant itself when it has grown enough. You can burn wood, energy plants (e.g. energy grass), etc... and use a generator.<\/li>\n<li>A more sophisticated approach to ferment biomass and produce methane, ethanol, etc... which you can burn.

This might be better than storing energy in batteries.<\/li>\n<li>You can use electric power coming from solar panels to split water. After that microbes can use the hydrogen as electron donor to fix $CO_2$, so they can create ethanol, etc... <\/li>\n<li>You can use light to split $CO_2$ into $CO$ and $1/2O_2$. You can use $CO$ in biological systems to create ethanol, etc... You can use $CO$ in shift reaction to create $H_2$.

That's because the brain, being critical for survival, is a very high-maintenance organ. At rest, the membrane potentials of all neurons - firing or at \"rest\" - need to be controlled/maintained.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of all the energy used by the brain, about 25% of it is needed for signal-independent function (protein synthesis, phospholipid turnover, etc.) Furthermore, there are two types of cells in the brain: neurons and glial cells. The glial cells (about 30%) use from 17 to 40% of the energy depending on whose estimates you use. The rest is needed (by neurons) for signal-related processes - maintaining/restoring cell membrane potential, etc. - only a fraction of which is used for <em>thinking<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The brain never rests - it is highly active even in sleep, with both excitatory and inhibitory activities needing energy. Higher mental functions (e.g. doing math problems) only shifts the areas of highest activity a little bit compared to all the activity that occurs without our awareness of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if we could measure glucose consumption of <em>the entire brain<\/em> while daydreaming vs. doing math, we might be able to answer that question, but the truth is, brain activity doesn't occur in isolation. Someone doing challenging math problems is using more energy in other areas of the body as well; respiration rate, heart rate, muscle tension, etc. varies with the stress of the challenge, so glucose levels alone can't be relied upon (in fact, stress would increase our body's production of glucose) to indicate energy expenditure.<\/p>\n\n<p>The end result is that in isolation, rigorous mental activity (which can be maintained only for a relatively short duration without fatigue, so it occurs in bursts) expends very little of the total energy the brain uses.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A common view equates concentrated mental effort with mental work, and it is fashionable to attribute a high demand for mental effort to the process of problem solving in mathematics. Nevertheless, there appears to be no increased energy utilization by the brain during such processes.

Not all of the calculations I performed are explicitly necessary, but were simply the best way for me to wrap my head around it at the time and <em>may<\/em> be incorrect!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Since plants are mostly glucose and water you could find the net glucose content of the plant (which will vary greatly -- but let's give a rough estimate of 90% as an average). So if you have a 10kg plant, ~1kg of the mass will be a mixture of cellulose, starch, and other stuff.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the sake of ease, let's ignore the other stuff and focus on the cellulose and starch which we'll say makes up the 1kg. Both Cellulose and Starch are Glucose configurations, so what we have is 1kg of Glucose.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia the net amount of energy a plant devotes to biomass construction/CO<sub>2<\/sub> fixation is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">3-6%<\/a>, and the Gibbs Free Energy conversion of CO<sub>2<\/sub> to Glucose is 114kcal. If I've done my math correctly that means a mole of CO<sub>2<\/sub> to Glucose for a typical plant takes 2280kcal (or about what I burn in a day as a 6'4\" man). <\/p>\n\n<p>So, how many moles of Glucose is in our 1kg Glucose plant mass? The molecular mass of Glucose is 180.16g/mol. 1kg/180.16g/mol = 5.55 moles of Glucose. We don't need to know how many moles of CO<sub>2<\/sub> we started with because we're not limited there; the atmosphere provides all the CO<sub>2<\/sub> we could ask for. We just know that we have 5.55 moles of Glucose, and it took 12654kcal of energy to convert however many moles of CO<sub>2<\/sub> into that many moles of Glucose.<\/p>\n\n<p>That 12654kcal is also equivalent to 52944.34kJ of energy. Now, the solar constant is ~1.36kW/m<sup>2<\/sup> ... or (1360J/s)/m<sup>2<\/sup>. So, how much area of your hypothetical plant is exposed to the Sun? A square-meter isn't an unreasonable amount for larger houseplants, so let's just work with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>52944.34kJ / 1.36kW = 38929.66s = 648.82min = 10.8 hours' worth of Sun exposure to produce 1kg of plant mass.

Plants \"take-in\" 1.36kW/m<sup>2<\/sup> when exposed to sunlight. How large the plant's area is will determine how much energy it takes in overall.

The black color can be very intensive in some stage of their development, since it is a part of the spread mechanism.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Members of the <a href=\"http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/may2004.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">genus Coprinus<\/a> have been collectively known as the \"inky caps\" because of the curious character of autodeliquescence of their gills-- in other words self-digestion to release their basidiospores. Most of these species have gills that are very thin and very close to one another, which does not allow for easy release of the spores. Moreover the elongated shape of mushroom does not allow for the spores to be shot off the basidia and get caught in air currents as in most other mushrooms. Coprinus species \"compensate\" for this by a sequential maturation of the spores from the bottom of the gill towards the top. After the spores have matured and been released, the gill tissue digests itself and begins to curl up, allowing easy release of the basidiospores above. In other words, the digestion opens up the fruiting body so that spores from further up the gills become exposed to the air and a clear path of spore release. The self-digestion continues until the entire fruiting body has turned to black ink. In the olden days this ink was actually used for writing. The self-digestion is also a way of releasing the spores over a longer period of time, and allowing the release of spores from very closely spaced narrow gills borne inside a longitudinally tall pileus. If any Coprinus species are collected for eating or for scientific study, they must be cooked or dried right away, since the self-digesting enzymes seem to kick into high gear after the mushroom is removed from its substrate. They're pretty easy to find too-- the genus name Coprinus gives you a pretty good idea where to look for these mushrooms-- in dung or very rich organic soil.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>examples:\n<a href=\"https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2008/07/01/the-dish-on-deliquescence-in-coprinus-species/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ghsp1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-4692496/stock-photo-coprinus-comatus-ink-mushrooms-on-a-green-forest-background.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/McTyI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coprinus_comatus-2_hg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">3.<\/a>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eXd5g.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":34883,"question_id":31301,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31301/what-is-this-mushroom","last_activity_date":1433351281,"creation_date":1428887161,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is this mushroom?","body":"<p>I found a singular mushroom in my back yard,  It is jet black, seems to have gills and looks somewhat like a flower do to it's upturned-ness.

Lots of information about the behavioural modifications of hosts by fungi can be found in <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150941\">Roy et al. (2006)<\/a>, but they can involve both climbing to exposed locations and special mechanisms for host attachement at death: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In many cases the final interactions, or endgames, between a host and pathogen involve complex behavioral modifications such as the infected insect seeking an elevated position where wind currents can effectively disseminate conidia. Elevation seeking by insects at late stages of infection is a common phenomenon that was recognized by early insect pathologists who noted that diseased lepidopteran larvae, such as Lymantria monacha (the nun moth), infected with baculoviruses migrated to the tops of trees where they died (94). This host-altered behavior was named \u201cWipfelkrankheit\u201d or \u201cWipfelsucht\u201d (meaning tree top disease in German) for viral diseases (41) and \u201csummit disease\u201d for fungal diseases (24, 57, 106).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some fungi do not produce rhizoids, but the host is held in situ by host structures alone, namely the legs or mouthparts (mandibles or stylets). The pose of the dead insect is generally characteristic of the pathogen species involved. For instance, E. grylli-infected grasshoppers (Figure 3a) and E. scatophagae\u2013infected yellow dung flies (Figure 3b) seek elevated positions on grasses or other vegetation and cling tightly (death grip) with their legs (96). Tipulids infected with fungal species from the genera Eryniopsis and Entomophaga also attach to grasses with their long legs, often overhanging water (Figures 5b,c).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you do google image searches on <a href=\"https://www.google.se/search?q=Entomophthora+fly+abdomen&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=BuZ&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-SE:official&amp;channel=sb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d91DVMKxGou9ygPop4KwCw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=773\">\"<em>Entomophthora fly abdomen<\/em>\"<\/a> or <a href=\"https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=fly+Cordyceps+abdomen&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=773&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNNDVNieIsL8ywPIroKAAQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#tbm=isch&amp;q=fly+Cordyceps\">\"<em>fly Cordyceps<\/em>\"<\/a> you can see some examples of infections.

The study is based on conscious decision making in rats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Performance of rats were assessed in the following task:<\/p>\n\n<p>The rats have to poke their snout into a waiting port until a auditory signal (beep) is heard.\nAfter first beep the rats can get a small reward (small amount of water) in the reward port. However if the rat waits for a second beep it gets to have a bigger reward. <\/p>\n\n<p>So there were three behavioral outcomes in the experiment done with 37 individuals:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Short-poke trials: Those that didn't wait for the signal (8.3 ± 4.6%)<\/li>\n<li>Impatient trials: Those that waited for the first beep but did not wait for the second beep (58.8 ± 3.9%)<\/li>\n<li>Patient trials: Those who successfully got the bigger reward. (32.9 ± 1.4%)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The impatient ones did not usually quit immediately after the first beep. This was not a lethargic response to signal but a moment of conflict between two decisions. There was a distribution of waiting times. The patient ones immediately responded to the second beep and took their reward.<\/p>\n\n<p>Neural activity was studied in the M2 (secondary motor) cortex of impatient rats during the tasks and two kinds of neural activity was observed:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ramp-to-threshold: Firing rate kept increasing till the end of waiting time suggestive of a neural threshold to quit waiting. (Fig 1)<\/li>\n<li>Steady-transient activity: Firing rate correlated with waiting time i.e. higher firing rate higher the waiting time. This could constitute the neurons that are making the rat wait.

The neurons that showed a certain activity in the above tasks did not behave the same way in the same rats performing a slightly different task.<\/p>\n\n<p>So action potential is generated in the brain by \"thoughts\". However these thoughts are not generated de-novo. Any conscious decision is based on memory of past events and similar events evoke those memories, which in cellular terms is generation of action potential. In this case the action potential is generated in response to the rats' sensory input in the form of a beep. Other kinds of responses are instinctive and the brain circuitry has evolved to generate these kinds of responses to certain stimuli such as fear. The above example is a study of conscious decision making based on an acquired memory.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28635,"question_id":28624,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1433321324},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aab80aeaf4754dee5d4a758db50e7213?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":460,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/460/memming","reputation":2145,"display_name":"Memming","accept_rate":70},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1424276396,"creation_date":1424276396,"body":"<ol>\n<li><p>There's a philosophical issue here: if you believe \"thought\" originates outside of the physical brain, you are probably some sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_%28philosophy_of_mind%29\">dualist<\/a>.

There is no real \"waiting period\" until the immune system starts attacking the virus (or bacteria or whatever), this happens instantaneously when the virus is recognized.<\/p>\n\n<p>To do so, we have two, independent systems, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">innate immune system<\/a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">adaptive immune system<\/a>. The innate imune system reacts immediately and launches a unspecific, but still very effective answer to a virus. The adaptive immune system delivers a highly specific (via antibodies) immune response, which takes a while since the generation of specific antibodies takes some time (the body produces antibodies which are then matched against the virus). It works like shown in the figure (from <a href=\"http://pulmotect.com/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wuD8v.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>It is also the adaptive immune system which mediates the long-lived immunity against pathogens which have triggered a immune response. Once you get in contact with such a pathogen again, the adaptive immune system can react immediately and protect you. This is also how vaccinations work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both immune answers start immediately upon pathogen recognition, there is not benefit in delaying (or suppressing) this immune response. In contrary, this is highly dangerous for the individual, as you can see in persons, which have received a transplant. These need to suppress their immune system in order to prevent a transplant rejection, but at the price that they get sick a lot easier.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are some diseases, where a partly modulation of the immune system is beneficial. These are autoimmune diseases where the immune system is directed against the own body. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression\" rel=\"nofollow\">Examples<\/a> would be rheumatoid and reactive athritis.<\/p>\n","answer_id":34815,"question_id":34782,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1433223100},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c345be66512ee14f08acd1e27e387c4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1578,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1578/rumtscho","reputation":1534,"display_name":"rumtscho","accept_rate":70},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1433261571,"creation_date":1433261571,"body":"<p>No, this wouldn't happen. The logic of your proposition assumes that chronic diseases are caused by the strength of the immune response being insufficient to kill off the virus, resulting in a long-term equilibrium between the amount of virus particles produced and the amount of virus particles killed. <\/p>\n\n<p>In reality, this is not how chronic diseases work. Only a small amount of chronic diseases are caused by viruses. There are many which have other causes, not all of which can be defended against by the immune system - e.g. chronic depression is not curable by immune response. <\/p>\n\n<p>But even if we focus on chronic virus infections such as herpes simplex, they are not sustained by the mechanism you describe. They happen due to the fact that our immune system simply does not know how to get them out of their new home within our body, they are just that good at hiding during latency. So even if you could cause a strong immune response all at once, it wouldn't kill all viruses at once. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even if we have viruses whose serum presence depends on a constant growth vs. destruction dynamic (I don't know if these exist at all), an overly strong immune response won't be that good for the human host. Inflammation is a dangerous state, most of the unpleasant feeling you get when you are sick is not due to the virus itself but due to your own immune response, which causes the fever, muscle pains etc. associated with many acute infectious diseases. If we were to ramp this up, you'd probably get a fever high enough to cook you alive, or some other undesirable effects. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a side note, I also doubt the author's argument which suggests that long-ish convalescence times evolved because shorter ones would leave the system in an undesirable equilibrium. Sure, an alternative reality is thinkable where the innate and adaptive responses described by Chris occur much stronger at the beginning, leading to steeper curves and shorter healing times. But the simpler explanation for that is that 1) our immune system is not perfect, and it evolved to the highest healing speed it could achieve, and 2) an immune system with higher acceleration would have been way too costly in terms of resources available to the body. An evolutionary advantage in having a low-acceleration immune system is a strong assumption for which I see no support, especially considering that the residual immunity provided by the adaptive immune system would prevent the dynamic equilibrium suggested in your quote. <\/p>\n","answer_id":34845,"question_id":34782,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34782/can-suppression-of-the-immune-system-help-cure-chronic-diseases","last_activity_date":1433274920,"creation_date":1433127497,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can suppression of the immune system help cure chronic diseases?","body":"<p>I am not a biologist, but recently while reading an article on Scholarpedia about <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Self-organization\" rel=\"nofollow\">self-organization<\/a> I encountered a fascinating biological observation concerning immune response to infections.  To quote the article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whether the resulting patterns are stable or oscillating depends on the relation of the time constants. If the antagonistic reaction has a longer time constant than the self-enhancing reaction, oscillations or burst-like activations will occur. An example is the time course of an infection: The infection with few viruses could be sufficient to trigger a sickness since the viruses replicate themselves (self-enhancement). The antagonistic reaction, mediated by the immune system, is much slower. It takes a day to become sick, but a week to become healthy again. (What appears on a first inspection as a disadvantage is in fact a good strategy. If the immune system would be much faster, an equilibrium between virus production and virus removal would be established. After a single infection we would fight for the rest of our life against the virus. However, due to the burst mode, we become sick for a short while but the virus is subsequently completely eliminated).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the quote may be hard to parse out of context, I'll recapitulate: The writer is asserting that the immune system's response to infections is slower than might be physically possible because such slowness actually makes the response more effective.  By waiting a few days, the patient is sick for longer than they might be happy about, but when the infection goes away, it's gone for good.  If the immune system responded immediately to an infection, it might result in a low-level infection that persists indefinitely.<\/p>\n\n<p>This makes me wonder: For chronic diseases, is the reason they are chronic related to the time scale of the infection vs. that of the immune system's response?  Could such diseases possibly be cured by <em>suppressing<\/em> the immune system for a time so as to get the \"burst\" effect alluded to in the quote above?<\/p>\n","question_id":34782,"tags":["immunology","infection"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":107,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4edc82535acb750e102ba69cec6aa5a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16047,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16047/puradox","reputation":26,"display_name":"puradox"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b4833d86d3cccc3ccfd6eeaf0b767e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14946,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14946/mdperry","reputation":2645,"display_name":"mdperry"},"score":2,"post_id":34816,"edited":false,"creation_date":1433207517,"comment_id":56213,"body":"I think that is a great question, but as far as I know not a great deal is known about the process.
