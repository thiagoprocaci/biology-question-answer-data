If the blockage of this site prevents the binding of MtMCM to both ssDNA and dsDNA, this would suggest that the same site is used for both. The research paper suggests that ssDNA and dsDNA do share the same binding site because chelation of magnesium ions prevented the protein from binding to DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>No ATP hydrolysis was detected in reaction mixtures containing the K341E or delta-N mutant proteins, however, both wt and K341E protein still formed complexes with the DNA.

If the selection pressure isn't strong enough then mildly disadvantageous traits will continue to persist in the population. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the reasons for why a trait is not evolved even though it may be advantageous to the organism, are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is no strong pressure against the individuals not having that trait. In other words lack of the trait is not strongly disadvantageous.<\/li>\n<li>The trait might have a tradeoff which essentially makes no change to the overall fitness. <\/li>\n<li>Not enough time has elapsed for an advantageous mutation to get fixed. This doesn't mean that the mutation had not happened yet. It means that the situation that rendered the mutation advantageous had arisen quite recently. Consider the example of a mutation that confers resistance against a disease. The mutation wouldn't be advantageous if there was no disease. When a population encounters the disease for the first time, then the mutation would gain advantage but it will take some time to establish itself in the population.<\/li>\n<li>The rate for that specific mutation is low and therefore it has not yet happened. Mutation rates are not uniform across the genome and certain regions acquire mutations faster than the others. Irrespective of that, if the overall mutation rate is low then it would take a lot of time for a mutation to arise and until then its effects cannot be seen.<\/li>\n<li>The specific trait is too genetically distant: it <em>cannot<\/em> be the result of a mutation in a single generation. It might, conceivably, develop after successive generations, each mutating farther, but if the intervening mutations are at too much of a disadvantage, they will not survive to reproduce and allow a new generation to mutate further away from the original population.<\/li>\n<li>The disadvantage from not having the trait normally arises only after the reproductive stage of the individual's lifecycle is mostly over.  This is a special case of \"no strong pressure\", because evolution selects genes, not the organism. In other words the beneficial mutation does not alter the reproductive fitness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Evolution is not a directed process and it does not actively try to look for an optimum.

The list is not an exhaustive and there are some conceptual overlaps. I have to say it is kind messy but one can hardly make a list without overlap for this question.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The trait seems advantageous but it is not, maybe due to its effect on another component of fitness (trade-off). It sounds to me to be the most likely explanation whenever you are wondering why a given species does not carry a given trait. In other words, the fitness landscape matter.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The trait is not that easy to build it requires a series of mutations that are either neutral, quasi-neutral or deleterious.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The mutation just hasn't happened yet (lag load).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the mutant variant had appeared several times but got extinct because of genetic drift even though it was beneficial (assuming no fitness valley to cross).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Putting the two previous points together, if only one mutation (one SNP) is needed to build this trait and if the trait is beneficial but quasi neutral, then  the expected time before fixation to occur is around $10^9$ generations. Here is why. Let $N$ be the population size and $\\mu$ be the mutation rate. In a diploid population (but the end result is the same for the haploids), there are $2n\\mu$ appearing at this locus each generation. As the mutation is quasi neutral, its probability of fixation (calculated from Wright-Fisher equations or Moran birth-death process or from Kimura's diffusion equation) is $\\frac{1}{2}N$. Therefore the rate at which fixation occur is $2N\\mu \\frac{1}{2N} = \\mu$. $\\mu$ for a SNP in a species that has large genome is around 10^{-9}. The probability that fixation occurs in $t$ generations is given by the exponential distribution with parameter $\\mu$ ad the expected value of this exponential distribution is $\\frac{1}{10^{-9}} = 10^9$ generations. If there is one generation per year, that takes a lot of time! Of course those calculations are a good approximation when the trait of interest is quasi-neutral. If positive selection is very very strong on this trait to the point that we can completely neglect drift, then the expected time for the mutant to occur is $\\frac{1}{2N\\mu}$, which is $10^5$ for a population size of $N = 10000$ which is still quite a lot. In the meantime, the environment or the genetic background may change so that the trait is not advantageous anymore. The above calculations assumed that the trait appeared with only one mutation and that only one SNP can cause the trait to exist. One can be more general by summing exponential distribution (for multiple mutation scenarios) and increasing the mutation rate (for mutations at different loci can make the trait exist).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the mutant variant had appeared several times but got extinct because of drift because the Ne in the genomic region is very low due to the act that there are many loci under selection in the surroundings (background selection).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>the trait is beneficial and occur sometime but either stays at low frequency or even regularly disappear due to migration of individuals coming from an environmental where this trait is strongly deleterious (dispersal load).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Be careful to understand what evolution does and therefore to understand what advantageous mean. Taking kin selection/group selection / lineage selection appart to make things easier, an advantageous allele is the one who increase the fitness of its carrier. The effect of a given allele depend on the environment and on the genetic background in which it exists. A beneficial allele does not necessarily increase survival or increase the probability of the population to not get extinct.

That doesn't mean individuals with that trait have more offspring, not even on average, unless <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers\">the law of large numbers<\/a> applies. A randomly mutated perfect squirrel could appear, and since it's only one, it gets run over by a car before it can reproduce and all perfect traits are lost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is a chance that a trait is beneficial for the individual, but doesn't have a significant effect on its chance of having offspring. For an example, take human eyesight. People with really poor eyesight have a disadvantage. But most people have good enough eyesight until they are too old to have kids, so it doesn't matter to evolution if they fall off a cliff afterwards. It may even be advantageous if kids don't have to spend resources to care for their parents.<\/p>\n\n<p>And a very nice effect is a swarm effect where you look at entire swarms, for example of fish. Take a swarm or community that reproduces primarily within itself, where for some reason only traits that are beneficial for the individual can get inherited. As soon as the swarm gets into competition with a superior swarm - where traits that benefited the swarm got inherited - the entirety of the former swarm may die. <\/p>\n\n<p>There's also the effect of society. If during one decade a society thinks people with green hair are not attractive partners - even tough it's better for camouflage - it sucks to have green hair during that decade. This doesn't only apply to humans. I remember reading that among some bird species the singing evolves and which songs are \"hip\"/attractive depends on social factors as well as genes. Just imagine what would have happened if a small number of humans would have started to grow bat wings that made them fully capable of flight, during the time of the Spanish Inquisition - rather than spreading the new gene they would have burned on a stake.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's not forget about the really cool effect of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-dependent_selection\">frequency dependent selection<\/a> where a trait is only beneficial if not too many other individuals have it. These traits can be beneficial for an individual, or a species, or both, but only if not too many individuals carry the trait. A community of humans can benefit from super smart people who have limited control of their bodies and emotions, but if all humans in the community are like that the community has a problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, there's the change in external conditions. If conditions change, many species will simply go extinct (e.g. Ice Age). Imagine all viruses disappear. If there are no viruses, a trait that makes the immune system more efficient against bacteria and cancer at the expense of having no defense against viruses, is clearly a beneficial trade.

Solid tumors have this microenvironment if you will, and the human tumor microenvironment often suffers from a lack of oxygen and nutrients, and acidosis (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254868\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milosevic et al., 2004<\/a>). The distance from the outside of the tumor to the core has an established diffusion gradient of oxygen, nutrients, etc. (<a href=\"http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/11/19/6772.full.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cristini et al., 2005<\/a>, especially since blood vessels can't always penetrate to these areas).

Furthermore, since tumors maintain a constant inward pressure, the dead cells are essentially eaten by the living cells and everything is pushed to the center, thereby providing the interior environment of the tumor materials to work with (<a href=\"https://math.la.asu.edu/~kuang/class/mmm/Lecture11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greenspan, 1972<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>There are gross metabolic shifts explained below that provide the tumors different ways of obtaining nutrients. I don't think it has so much to do with glucose diffusing as deep into the tumor as oxygen as it does this metabolic reprogramming.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the tumor alter it's expression profile to fit it's needs under the stress of starvation? Example based approach<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Hypoxia-inducible factors<\/em> or HIF unfortunately modulate tumor progression. (See <a href=\"http://mcb.asm.org/content/29/10/2570\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bellot et al., 2009<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2447655/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zhang et al., 2008<\/a> for examples of autophagy induced by HIF, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00704-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huang et al., 2014<\/a> for a non-exhaustive overview of additional ways HIF modulates cancer progression). Tumor cells suffering chronic hypoxia upregulate their GLUT transporters and glycolytic pathways via action from HIF-1α/ß because they must often begin to produce ATP without oxygen. They also, however, downregulate mitochondrial activity through transactivation of PDK1 and MXI1 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19143055\" rel=\"nofollow\">Denzo et al., 2008<\/a>. PDK1 ends up inhibiting PDH, and MXI1 ends up actually reducing the number of mitochondria per cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>The incorporation, then, of <em>glutamine<\/em> into the TCA cycle where pyruvate would normally be needed supplements the now-missing carbon requirement (see figure below) where pyruvate would be involved, because referring again to the Denzo paper, in the hypoxic tumor pyruvate is converted into lactate by LDH, in part explaining the acidosis.

Looking here at alternative fuel pathways during starvation of the tumor, the cells can scavenge from the necrotic center of the tumor, utilize autophagy, other carbon source, etc. to fit their needs.\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3850091/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White, E., 2013<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>More specifically, there is a paradigm shift in tumor cells deficient in PKCζ that involves (1) upregulation of Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and Phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1), which are normally repressed by PKCζ, (2) uninhibited mTOR activity, which is normally shut down during nutrient depletion, and (3) inhibited AMPK and autophagy pathways, which are normally active in nutrient depletion. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that PKCζ-deficient cells displayed gene alterations in pathways consistent with the use of glutamine as a glucose alternative.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In both humans and mice they conclude that with respect to intestinal cancers, PKCζ regularly acts as a tumor suppressor. But the major point here is that multiple pathologic mutations can be implicated here to try and make sense of the Warburg effect.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632615\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leithner et al., 2015<\/a> likewise shows that tumor cells (this is specific for lung cancer) can begin to utilize lactate to form glucose building blocks by modifying the gluconeogenesis pathway, mediated largely by a mitochondrial isoform of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) known as PCK2:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Under low glucose, all three carbons from (13)C\u2083-lactate appeared in the PEP pool, further supporting a conversion of lactate to pyruvate, via pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate, and via PCK2 to phosphoenolpyruvate.\" <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd like to bring up again that in the hypoxic tumor, evidence supports that pyruvate is converted to lactate, but now I imply the lactate can potentially be converted to glucose, a positive feedback loop providing the tumor glucose. This is somewhat supported by the clinical study in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00298.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">Koukourakis et al., 2006<\/a> that shows tumors overexpressing LDH-5 and HIF-1α/2α that in the malignant tumors, oxygen consumption was low and glucose consumption was high. But I also want to go back to the Denzo paper because they brought up some interesting points, and I recommend reading it: The decreased mitochondrial need for oxygen might be more important than the increased glycolysis.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Some interesting points<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) The metabolic shift induced by hypoxia lowers the tumor oxygen requirement and heightens it's glucose requirement. This doesn't necessarily mean the tumor is actually getting glucose, and sometimes, it doesn't mean the tumor cell is actually deprived of oxygen, either, rather the hypoxia is induced by simply <em>not enough<\/em> oxygen to fit the high oxygen requirement, read <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25254649\" rel=\"nofollow\">Takakusagi et al., 2014<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) By reprogramming it's metabolism and cannibalizing cells that actually did die from deprivation, the tumor can viably \"get\" energy -though not necessarily directly in the form of glucose- through a number of pathological mutations. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) Anaerobic glycolysis followed by LDH activity is an efficient adaptation if you look at <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21508971\" rel=\"nofollow\">Koppenol, Bounds &amp; Dang, 2011<\/a>, the hypoxic tumor cell can produce 26 ATP and 26 lactic acid from 13 glucose in the time it takes oxidative phosp. to produce 36 ATP from one glucose. In a time of starvation efficient energy production is a good thing, and the hypoxic mechanism is <strong>fast<\/strong>, especially if we consider the tumor is producing glucose from lactic acid in any capacity. They also point out that tumors become in a way addicted to the Warburg effect, <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"... oncogenic deregulation of biomass accumulation for cell proliferation creates an increased, sustained bioenergetic demand that addicts cancer cells to an adequate anabolic supply.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\"<strong>How can glucose diffuse to places where oxygen cannot, even if oxygen is a much smaller molecule?<\/strong>\" I don't have such a definitive answer for this, though I would personally determine that it doesn't, not by much. Where I want to go is it's not really about glucose and oxygen getting to the same place. I suspect that they reach just about equally as deep into the tumor depending on the composition of the tumor itself and the tissue it resides in. I also want to point out that hypoxia is not the same as <em>anoxia<\/em>, where there is no oxygen and the cells are for the most part dead in those regions. If you read the length of this post, you understand that the tumor cells are experiencing <strong>hypoxia<\/strong>, or a deficient <em>amount<\/em> of oxygen reaching them, and likewise I would assume a deficient <em>amount<\/em> of glucose, as <strong>opposed to a lack thereof<\/strong>. In that sense again, and because there's not a lot of nutrients to go around, we're alluding to the efficient usage of both glucose and oxygen, and beneficial biomass accumulation, which we demonstrated the Warburg effect is key to. Because once you get to the point of anoxia, again, we're looking at anoxic cell death, but those cells get turned into what essentially amounts to recycling material.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Closing Notes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't see why glucose wouldn't be able to diffuse along it's gradient into the tumor considering there is a microfluid environment inside the tumor, but where we're talking about in the hypoxic region (not the anoxic regions) I suspect there is still <em>some<\/em> glucose present just as there's <em>some<\/em> oxygen. It's important, then, for the tumor cells to have more of the GLUT transporters from the action of HIF, and the efficient usage of whatever metabolites it can get. I generally lack data for how far into a tumor they can actually perfuse, but to me it would be hard to quantify since there are many confounding factors such as what tissue the tumor originated from, irregularities in the microcirculation, etc.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42841,"question_id":42839,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1454372123},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0bfda2f519df763962a25d9c7e673a96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22562,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22562/jiggunjer","reputation":108,"display_name":"jiggunjer"},"score":0,"post_id":42847,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458110087,"comment_id":77125,"body":"Personally I think aerobic glycolysis is poorly worded (though I know it is common). in my opinion ahypoxic hyperglycolysis describes the phenotype better :)"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1454185725,"creation_date":1454185725,"body":"<p>I think this is a difficult question for which the answer is not clear --- to my knowledge there is little data on metabolism in solid tumors, and no clear consensus in the scientific community. So I'm not going to attempt to give a definitive answer, but here's at least a few thoughts / opinions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why transformed cells engage in aerobic glycolysis, or the \"Warburg effect\", is a question people have been trying to answer for nearly a hundred years now. There are dozens of hypotheses, but none of them is broadly accepted. One popular hypothesis laid out by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15516961\">Gilles &amp; Gatenby<\/a> says that transformed cells from solid tumors are glycolytic because they have been selected for anaerobic metabolism in a hypoxic environment, and this selection is somehow irreversible, so that the cells stay glycolytic even after being extracted from the tumor and cultured in aerobic conditions. I think this hypothesis is the origin of the idea of hypoxic and yet glycolytic tumors.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a way the Gilles &amp; Gatenby hypothesis is a clever idea --- it rests on the well-accepted fact that most cells become glycolytic in hypoxia, and rhymes with the concept of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/959840\">selection for survival in tumors<\/a>. But the problem with the argument (as you have realized) is that the tumor environment would have to be low in oxygen <em>and at the same time<\/em> high in glucose. I agree with you that it is unlikely that such an environment could arise due to lack of blood supply, since oxygen diffuses more easily through tissues (and cells) than glucose does. Moreover, considering the high demand for glucose by glycolytic cells, glucose should become limiting long before oxygen runs out. So one can argue that poorly vascularized tumors should be mainly oxidative, not glycolytic!<\/p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge, there is no data demonstrating existence of (regions of) solid tumors with low oxygen <em>and<\/em> high glucose. There is of course ample evidence that many solid tumors consume large amounts of glucose, and also many studies showing hypoxic regions in tumors. But most likely these are different types of tumors, or different regions. In an environment with <em>neither<\/em> oxygen nor glucose, cells will simply die --- which is exactly what happens in the necrotic cores of larger solid tumors.<\/p>\n\n<p>The best source of further information is probably the tumor physiology literature. <a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/49/23/6449.short\">This review<\/a> is a good starting point. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, another issue with Gilles &amp; Gatenby's hypothesis is that aerobic glycolysis can easily be demonstrated in cells that have never been in a tumor. For example, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v22/n2/full/cr2011145a.html\"><em>in vitro<\/em> transformation<\/a> can increase glycolysis, and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v261/n5562/abs/261702a0.html\">normal lymphocytes<\/a> induce rapid glycolysis when activated by receptor stimulation. So there is no need to assume that glycolytic tumors are hypoxic.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42847,"question_id":42839,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/615557b93ae0cf96f8c9a7a00cd4a78d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":22568,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22568/jyotsna","reputation":11,"display_name":"Jyotsna"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSuGp.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19521,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19521/jordi-zambrino","reputation":1024,"display_name":"Jordi Zambrino","accept_rate":83},"score":1,"post_id":44320,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458068349,"comment_id":77104,"body":"Hello Jyotsna, welcome to Biology.SE and thank you for your contribution to the site.

In my experiments I have observed the exterior of rat glioma models well perfused but not so well inside. We have used MR based methods to study perfusion and IHC to study vasculature. In the same way, I have observed increased MCT-4 expression (indirectly, more lactic acid production) in the outer regions of the tumor but certainly sometimes there are some pockets inside with increased MCT-4. But no matter what, the whole of the tumor and surroundings is acidic. This could be due to lactic acid or maintenance of intracellular pH by proton exchangers. Though there is no clear answer, there are lots of points on which I agree with CMosychuk. Low oxygen tension increases HIF activity which has its repercussions. I also faced another curious situation. I was working with pseudohypoxic tumors. They don't have low oxygen tension but still have activated HIF because HIF is artificially stabilized thanks to some mutations (VHL, SDHB). Now, I expected more GLUT because I could see increased 18F-FDG uptake in these tumors but I saw increased hexokinase-2 expression. Remember, in this case there was no hypoxia, still activation of HIF had its effect that is increased glycolysis! <strong>So I too think that low oxygen tension might mean low nutrient supply but it certainly does not mean no nutrient supply.<\/strong> We see tumor parts having low oxygen tension, happily living and metabolizing and making the whole region acidic. I have not even seen a necrotic core in these tumors. When, I killed these cells giving temozolomide to the animals, the acidity was not there anymore.

It may also <em>increase physical endurance<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nRather than moving continuously through the environment, many animals interrupt their locomotion with frequent brief pauses. Pauses increase the time required to travel a given distance and add costs of acceleration and deceleration to the\nenergetic cost of locomotion. From an adaptation perspective, pausing should provide benefits that outweigh these costs <a href=\"http://www.uoguelph.ca/~amclab/amclab/Publications_files/McAdam%26Kramer.98.pdf\">(Adam &amp; kramer, 1998)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>One potential benefit of pausing is <strong>increased detection of prey<\/strong> by predators. Slower movement speeds likely improve prey detection by providing more time to\nscan a given visual field. <\/p>\n\n<p>A second plausible benefit is <strong>reduced attack rate<\/strong> by predators. Many predators are more likely to attack moving prey, perhaps because such prey is more easily detected or recognized. Indeed, motionlessness (\u2018freezing\u2019) is a widespread\nresponse by prey that detect a predator.<\/p>\n\n<p>A third benefit may be <strong>increased endurance<\/strong>. For animals moving faster than their aerobically sustainable speeds, the maximum distance run can be increased by taking pauses. These pauses allow the clearance of lactate from the muscles through aerobic mechanisms. <\/p>\n\n<p>PS: If you mean with 'snappy' not only that small animals move intermittently, but also 'fast', then Remi.b's answers nicely covers the story why small critters are quick. Basically, it comes down to <a href=\"http://physics.info/newton-second/\">Newton's second law<\/a>, namely acceleration is inversely proportional to mass (<a href=\"http://zonalandeducation.com/mstm/physics/mechanics/forces/newton/newtonLaw2.html\">a = F/m<\/a>), <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1116/why-is-it-that-cats-can-jump-so-high-for-their-size-compared-with-humans\">but the size of muscle power is not<\/a>. Hence, bigger animals have more mass and need a lot more force to build up to accelerate at the same speed. That build up of force needs time (ever witnessed the vertical lift-off of a space shuttle?) Hence, small critters accelerate quicker and allow them to move 'snappy'.    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.uoguelph.ca/~amclab/amclab/Publications_files/McAdam%26Kramer.98.pdf\">Adam &amp; kramer, <em>Anim Behav<\/em> (1998); <strong>55<\/strong>: 109\u2013117<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":34688,"question_id":34683,"up_vote_count":44,"last_edit_date":1455099104},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cfe5f7d64f44be04f147295f5c7b88e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16003,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16003/ejp","reputation":95,"display_name":"EJP"},"score":-3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":0,"post_id":34716,"edited":false,"creation_date":1432980523,"comment_id":55925,"body":"The question body elaborates on the question: &quot;...pausing between each movement&quot;.

Everything can become toxic when consumed in excess - even water - and when we frequently add more salt to foods, we tend to consume sodium in potentially harmful excess. That's what your friends are referring to.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, salt (sodium) is one of the most essential substances your body needs to stay alive, for several reasons. One of the main purposes of sodium is the upkeep of blood's osmolarity (i.e. concentrations of osmotically active compounds. Higher salt concentration on one side of a permeable membrane attracts water to that side - I'm sure you've heard that before). There are numerous systems in your body to make sure the osmolarity of blood is correct. If they fail and blood becomes hypo or hypertonic, your cells will be sucked dry or pumped full of water and in either case, burst and die.<\/p>\n\n<p>Look up the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for example: when the kidney filters blood, it reabsorbs or lets through water depending on the current blood osmolarity; leading to higher or lower amount of higher or lower concentrated urine. You drink lots, your blood is diluted, it becomes less tonic, kidney registers that and lets water through more, you urinate more. There are many more elements involved there, including blood pressure, nerve signals stimulating thirst or hunger of different kinds, some hormones etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, there's a reason why the basic infusion given in hospitals to replace lost blood quickly isn't just water but normal saline.<\/p>\n\n<p>Delayed update to pick up some side aspects of your description: 1) There are of course things that humans do which have absolutely no value to them whatsoever.

Water wants to move to the high osmolarity places so its transport is mainly controlled by the transport of sodium through selective sodium channels. This is not just about blood osmolarity, e.g. the absorption of water from the guts, the filtration of blood in the kidney, the sweating, etc... all major water transport in the body is mediated by sodium transport. So sodium is essential.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your friends are right about too much sodium can harm you. Just try out something: eat something salty, and wait a few minutes. You will be thirsty, because sodium concentration increased your blood osmolarity, and so your body released hormones to restore osmolarity, and these hormones make you thirsty. After you drunk water, your blood pressure becomes higher until the kidney get rid of the extra sodium. High blood pressure is bad to your heart. This is just one way too much sodium can harm you...<\/p>\n\n<p>Your friends probably meant that if you don't have a lot of training and so you don't sweat a lot, you don't need crystalline salt in your food, because your food already contains enough sodium.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is an interesting question why do we love extra salt despite the fact that our food contains enough of sodium.

This is because the Michaelis-Menten equation is derived on the explicit assumption that the substrate concentration is much greater than the product concentration so that the back reaction does not occur. This is true at the start of a reaction in the lab when you add enzyme to your substrate. At later times when product builds up these conditions no longer hold and the M-M equation breaks down.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is possible to derive a different equation for the reversible case (as some other posters do) but this begs the question of the importance of the Michaelis-Menten equation for biology. The poster seems to think that it is some universal truth, important in its own right or because it models the reaction in the living cell. I think this misses the point, which I think is as follows.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It originally was a prediction from, and hence a test of, the hypothesis that enzymes have a single active site at which the substrate binds and is converted to products.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>It allowed two fundamental aspects of this enzyme model to be quantified: (i) the binding affinity of the substrate for the active site, as the inverse Km, and (ii) the catalytic efficiency ('smartness') as the turnover number or kcat, which is derived from Vmax (and enzyme concentration).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>These enzyme constants can be used to address biological questions, for example whether an enzyme capable of a particular reaction in the test tube is able to account for the observed reaction rates in a tissue. Or whether the substrate you find the enzyme can use is likely to be the physiological substrate in a tissue.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>It turns up enzymes that do not exhibit M-M kinetics, implying that some aspect of the model does not apply to them. This can be of mainly chemical interest (ping-pong kinetics and the like) or of physiological importance, as in allosteric kinetics (S-shaped rather than hyperbolic curve) shown by multi-subunit enzymes where the individual subunits show co-operativity, allowing more finely tuned regulation. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>And if you do want to model reactions within cells, the kinetic constants can be of use.

This in turn may be reversibly converted to $EP$, and reversible dissociation of product gives back the original form of the 'free' enzyme together with $p$.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The complexes $ES$ and $EP$ are sometimes called 'central complexes'<\/p>\n\n<p>However, in order to simplify the algebra, I will derive the rate law for the following simplified (and unrealistic) mechanism containing a single central complex. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDc37.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDc37.png\" alt=\"newSimpleMichaelisMenten\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>We need to be very, very careful here.  This simplifying assumption will not change the overall form of the  <em>kinetic constant<\/em> form of the rate law, that is both mechanism (3) and (4) will give rise to Eqn (1), but <em>it will make the definition of kinetic constants simpler<\/em>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We must not assume that these simplified definitions necessarily apply to any realistic case. The definitions for $V_{max}^f$  (Eqn 10) and $V_{max}^r$ (Eqn 11), for example, contain a single rate constant but those for the mechanism of Eqn (3) are more complex (Eqns 15 &amp; 16). <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus statements such as 'for unit enzyme concentration, $k_{3,2}$ equals the maximum velocity in the forward direction' are fraught with difficulties. (It probably is valid to argue, at least for the type of mechanisms considered here, that 'for unit enzyme concentration, the maximum velocity cannot exceed $k_{3,2}$').  <\/p>\n\n<p>But we digress.

It is easy to infer that ice-cream sales don't increase your risk of drowning, but the 2 are correlated because both ice-cream sales and risk of drowning increase at the same time of year; both are positively correlated with 'nice weather' traits.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the above example it is easy to say that the relationship is confounded. However, in a hypothetical study on type-2 diabetes that finds higher blood hematocrit (% volume of blood made up of red blood cells) is associated with increased odds of being diabetic, it is less clear whether higher hematocrit increases susceptibility/risk of becoming diabetic, or whether diabetes increases hematocrit. Longitudinal studies that follow the same individuals for many years help determine <em>which came first<\/em> - this is based on the assumption that if raised hematocrit is associated with increased risk of diabetes 5 years later, it is more likely that hematocrit is <em>causal<\/em>, and you have a biomarker for diabetes risk (although you still cannot say it is causal, it may just be a proxy for another 'hidden' trait, or the effect may be <em>mediated<\/em> by another unmeasured marker).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Causality<\/h2>\n\n<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become increasingly popular since the completion of the human genome project, and there are currently (15th August 2012) 7039 genetic variants (SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms) documented in the catalogue of published GWA studies (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/\">www.genome.gov/gwastudies<\/a>). These SNPs have been robustly associated with traits such as 'risk of type-2 diabetes', or 'blood adiponectin levels', by large genetic epidemiological studies, usually with many thousands of participants sampled. <\/p>\n\n<p>The key point about SNP associations is that the direction of effect is always known; a particular SNP may affect your adiponectin levels, but adiponectin does not affect the SNPs you inherit.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Mendelian Randomization<\/h2>\n\n<p>In an observational study that finds an association between (for example) circulating triglyceride levels and type-2 diabetes (using fasting glucose and insulin as 'proxies') it is not possible to determine the causal direction; do triglycerides increase risk of diabetes or vice versa? (This is an actual case study by <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db10-1317\">De Silva, <em>et al<\/em>. 2011<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Using the assumption that the inheritance of SNPs is essentially random (i.e. not affected by the trait you are measuring - in this example triglycerides) it is possible to determine the causal effect of triglycerides on the risk of diabetes. Note: this is only possible for traits (such as serum triglyceride levels) that have SNPs identified by GWA studies.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, you have already calculated the association between triglyceride levels (in this study a 1 standard-deviation (SD) increase in triglycerides was associated, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 2.68, with type-2 diabetes in almost 10,000 human participants). Because it is a cross-sectional study, only an association is reported, with no causal implications... yet!<\/p>\n\n<h3>Enter the SNPs<\/h3>\n\n<p>Having identified the SNPs that increase triglyceride levels (at the time of the study, 10 were reported in the literature), each participants genotype for these SNPs needs to be measured or inferred (generally this is performed in large cohort studies, which are then used for many different individual projects).<\/p>\n\n<p>A combined 'score' is then derived for each individual. This is conceptually very simple; if an individual has 4 of the 10 triglyceride raising alleles, they are given a score or 4, and so on. This is complicated by the fact that the SNPs have different effects on the triglycerides, so a 'weighted allele score' is derived instead (simply put, the coefficient of the SNP~triglyceride association is taken into account when adding risk allele scores). By using this kind of score, a 'per allele' estimation of the effects can be estimated;<\/p>\n\n<p>The association between the triglyceride levels and the allele score is then determined (by linear regression analysis - adjusted for age and sex, as these are known to affect triglycerides). There are actually 2 ways of performing the next analysis, the first of which is conceptually simpler, but the second of which is more robust.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Method 1: the 'triangulation' approach<\/h3>\n\n<p>The two observed associations calculated so far (per-SD trig. levels are associated with diabetes, and the per-allele SNP score are associated with per-SD trig. levels) can then be used to calculate an <em>expected<\/em> association. This is simply derived by multiplying the 2 coefficients together. Below is the 'triangulation' representation of this;<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ItJ0.png\" alt=\"Triangulation approach for Mendelian Randomization\"><\/p>\n\n<p>This <em>expected<\/em> association between the triglyceride-raising SNPs and risk of diabetes is only true if raised triglycerides increase the risk of diabetes. The <em>observed<\/em> association between the SNP-score and diabetes can then be calculated. If the expected and observed estimates are similar, then triglycerides raise diabetes risk, and are a causal biomarker. If the observed association is null (or, at least, much smaller), then triglycerides are likely to be secondary.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Method 2: the instrumental variable analysis<\/h3>\n\n<p>This method is for the more hardy statisticians. Instrumental variables are derived variables, and represent an intermediate between a proposed 'cause' and the 'effect', or outcome (in this case the triglyceride raising alleles are proposed to 'cause' diabetes, and this is mediated by the triglyceride levels themselves).<\/p>\n\n<p>Using a linear regression, the \"fitted values\" from a model with triglyceride levels as the outcome, and the weighted SNP score as the only independent variable, are extracted. These fitted values represent the variance in the triglycerides that is predicted by the SNP score. We are using the SNPs as the <em>instrument<\/em> here, as they directly influence the biomarker (exposure, i.e. triglycerides), and are not affected by either the exposure or the outcome (diabetes). <strong>The important assumption here is that the effect of the SNPs on the outcome is not confounded, and can only be mediated by the exposure - this is true for genotypes (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sim.3034\">Lawlor, <em>et al<\/em>. 2008<\/a>)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>By then determining the association between the derived variable and diabetes, you will know whether the proportion of the triglyceride variance predicted by the SNPs is associated with diabetes - if so, then triglycerides increase the risk of diabetes.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Results<\/h3>\n\n<p>The study performed both types of Mendelian Randomization analysis and found no evidence to suggest a causal association between triglycerides and diabetes phenotypes.<\/p>\n\n<p>So Mendelian Randomization is a useful tool for inferring causality with biomarkers. It is not necessarily conclusive evidence, but it can help distinguish biomarkers of particular importance and interest (with regard to interventions) from those that are just markers of the disease.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3184,"question_id":3171,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3171/what-is-mendelian-randomization-and-how-is-it-used-to-infer-causality-in-epidem","last_activity_date":1458035887,"creation_date":1344957318,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is Mendelian Randomization, and how is it used to infer causality in epidemiology?","body":"<p>Studies of human traits and diseases are inherently confined to observational studies, known as epidemiological studies.

Highly expressed regions will have higher number of reads.<\/p>\n\n<p>However the read depth non-uniformity also arises because of the nucleotide composition of the regions. This is true for all kinds of nucleic acid sequencing such as RNAseq, whole genome sequencing and ChIP seq. This is called sequence bias. This also depends on the sequencing methodology. A variety of factors play a role such as how well can the region be sheared, how well can it be amplified etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>For details have a look at this article by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23718773\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ross et al (2013)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sequencing technologies are vulnerable to multiple sources of bias.\n  Methods based on bacterial cloning and Sanger-chemistry sequencing [8]\n  were subject to many coverage-reducing biases, notably at GC extremes,\n  palindromes, inverted repeats, and sequences toxic to the bacterial\n  host [9\u201317]. Illumina sequencing [18] has been shown to lose coverage\n  in regions of high or low GC [19\u201322], a phenomenon also seen in other\n  'next-generation' technologies [3, 6]. PCR amplification during\n  library construction is a known source of undercoverage of GC-extreme\n  regions [20, 21] and similar biases may also be introduced during\n  bridge PCR for cluster amplification on the Illumina flowcell [23].\n  Illumina strand-specific errors can lead to coverage biases by\n  impairing aligner performance [24]. Ion Torrent [25], like 454 [26],\n  utilizes a terminator-free chemistry that may limit its ability to\n  accurately sequence long homopolymers [4, 27, 28], and may also be\n  sensitive to coverage biases introduced by emulsion PCR in library\n  construction. Complete Genomics [29] also uses amplification along\n  with a complex library construction process. The Pacific Biosciences\n  [30] process is amplification-free; therefore, one might expect it to\n  exhibit lower levels of coverage bias than the other technologies.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to sources in the wet lab, bias can be introduced by any\n  of the computational steps in the sequencing pipeline.\n  Signal-processing and base calling limitations could result in\n  under-representation or increased error rates in some locations, as\n  can inaccurate alignment. An inaccurate reference or sample-reference\n  differences can cause coverage or accuracy variations that may be\n  misdiagnosed as sequencing bias. Therefore, detecting bias is only the\n  first step and must be followed by more detailed experiments to assign\n  responsibility to the library preparation, sequencing, or\n  computational stages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Some analysis software try to correct for these biases while estimating the read abundance.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ross, Michael G., et al. \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23718773\" rel=\"nofollow\">Characterizing and measuring bias in sequence data.<\/a>\" <em>Genome Biol<\/em> 14.5 (2013): R51.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44306,"question_id":44260,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44260/why-are-some-genomic-regions-sequenced-more-than-the-others","last_activity_date":1458029359,"creation_date":1457901051,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why are some genomic regions sequenced more than the others?","body":"<p>We have to normalise read count data from RNA-Seq experiments in order to account for the fact that some genomic regions are mapped more than others. i.e. we get the tags per million reads (TPM).

It's unlikely that much grant money exists to answer questions about them. <\/p>\n\n<p>That said, though, I found a handful of groups that have done some work on them. It seems that they all noticed a statistical relationship between the occurrence of skin tags, obesity and metabolic syndrome. These are the papers describing their research efforts so far:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2011.04401.x/epdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2011.04401.x/epdf<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740583/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740583/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21860156\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21860156<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>None of the groups suggest a mechanistic explanation for the occurrence of skin tags, which makes me think that this remains a very open question. However, they all notice a correlation between skin tags and elevated leptin levels. <\/p>\n\n<p>Leptin is best known as a hunger/satiety regulating hormone. However, it functions through the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, which in turn activates a number of genes involved in cell survival and in turning off apoptosis, or programmed cell death. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fJdmv.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fJdmv.jpg\" alt=\"The JAK/STAT pathway\"><\/a>\nThis image comes from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v14/n11/fig_tab/nrc3818_F1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a> in Nature, which, unfortunately, is behind a paywall. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, my guess based on these data is that increased levels of leptin activate proliferative pathways in cells, leading to the occurrence of skin tags. That this proliferation results in benign cell growth probably has to do with competing tumor-suppressor and related pathways, which I can reasonably assume to be active and functioning, where outright cancer is not present. <\/p>\n\n<p>What I wonder now, but can't find any information on, is whether skin tags are the only <em>visible<\/em> evidence of differential cell proliferation, or whether there are other instances within the body. That is, if the leptin-to-skin-tag hypothesis holds, is there something special about skin cells in that response, or are they just the only visible signs of it? <\/p>\n","answer_id":44293,"question_id":43147,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43147/how-and-why-do-skin-tags-develop","last_activity_date":1457984790,"creation_date":1454964258,"answer_count":1,"title":"How and why do skin tags develop?","body":"<p>WebMD <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/removing-moles-and-skin-tags-topic-overview\">writes<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Skin tags are small, soft pieces of skin that stick out on a thin stem.

A key point to note is that they have common (shared) predators. A classic example is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliconius\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Heliconius<\/em><\/a> genus of butterfly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does it evolve?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The argument you make is <em>kind of<\/em> along the right lines, but it is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">group selection<\/a> argument, and is worded slightly badly as it insinuates that <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php#b4\" rel=\"nofollow\">evolution is a goal driven process<\/a>. I will use a toy example/thought experiment to explain why it's evolution is adaptive.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this example there are three species of butterfly are toxic. We will call these species <em>Butterfly-1<\/em>, <em>Butterfly-2<\/em>, and <em>Butterfly-3<\/em> (yeah, I'm not feeling very creative today). We also have a predator, a bird which likes to eat butterflies. We will call this species <em>Bird<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Butterfly-1<\/em> and <em>Butterfly-2<\/em> are very different to look at<\/strong>; they have different colours, shapes, and patterns. An individual <em>Bird<\/em> then eats one of <em>Butterfly-1<\/em> and becomes sick. That individual learns to avoid <em>Butterfly-1<\/em>. Our <em>Bird<\/em> is then hungry again, and eats <em>Butterfly-2<\/em>, and again gets sick, and learns to avoid <em>Butterfly-2<\/em>. Two individuals die before <em>Bird<\/em> can learn to avoid both species.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Butterfly-1<\/em> and <em>Butterfly-3<\/em> are very similar in appearance<\/strong>; they have similar colours, shapes, and patterns. An individual <em>Bird<\/em> then eats one of <em>Butterfly-1<\/em> and becomes sick. That individual learns to avoid <em>Butterfly-1<\/em>, but also to avoid the similar looking species <em>Butterfly-3<\/em>. Likewise, if it eats a <em>Butterfly-3<\/em> then it learns to avoid both <em>Butterfly-1<\/em> and <em>Butterfly-3<\/em>. This is Müllerian mimicry. Survival is higher in one or both species because of more rapid learning by predators, fewer individuals will die compared to the non-mimicry scenario.<\/p>\n\n<p>The essence of this is captured in the following statement from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443389/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Müller provided what could well be the first formal mathematical model to support an evolutionary hypothesis.

If the species are distinct in appearance, then each species would lose $n$ individuals in the course of educating predators. If, however, the two species were exactly alike in appearance, then the first species would lose only $a_1n/(a_1+a_2)$ and the second would lose only $a_2n/(a_1+a_2)$.

It's an excellent question as to why 2% of the men have either one condition, given that:<\/p>\n\n<p>Protanopes are more likely to confuse:-<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Black with many shades of red<\/li>\n<li>Dark brown with dark green, dark orange and dark red<\/li>\n<li>Some blues with some reds, purples and dark pinks<\/li>\n<li>Mid-greens with some oranges<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Deuteranopes are more likely to confuse:-<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mid-reds with mid-greens<\/li>\n<li>Blue-greens with grey and mid-pinks<\/li>\n<li>Bright greens with yellows<\/li>\n<li>Pale pinks with light grey<\/li>\n<li>Mid-reds with mid-brown<\/li>\n<li>Light blues with lilac<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>There are reports on the benefits of being red-green color blind under certain specific conditions. For example, <a href=\"http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/MorganAdamMollon1992.pdf\">Morgan <em>et al<\/em>. (1992)<\/a> report that the identification of a target area with a different <em>texture<\/em> or <em>orientation pattern<\/em> was performed better by dichromats when the surfaces were painted with with irrelevant colors. In other words, when color is simply a distractor and confuses the subject to focus on the task (i.e., texture or orientation discrimination), the lack of red-green color vision can actually be beneficial. This in turn could be interpreted as dichromatic vision being beneficial over trichromatic vision to <strong>detect color-camouflaged objects<\/strong>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Reports on improved foraging of dichromats under low-lighting are debated, but cannot be excluded.

Now a perfect answer should include all the regulatory steps involved in this transition (a lot) and all the places where a change of metabolic fluxes occur. But, the question can be answered in essence at least, by a very simple model.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Assume that no other regulations act except direct enzymatic feedback inhibition. This means that substrate being acted upon by an enzyme converting it to a product will stop being acted upon when the concentration of the product rises. Now, for the case in question. Lack of oxygen means that cytochrome c cannot work. Hence, it's substrate will accumulate, which is the product of the preceding enzyme, which will be blocked leading to the accumulation of its substrate and so on. This \"waterlogged\" system will continue leading to metabolite accumulation till pyruvate starts piling up. Now this pyruvate piling does something different because it had two enzymes that could act upon it. The other enzyme, which converts it to lactate does not have this feedback blockage and hence can function. So, the pyruvate is now converted into lactate, which requires NADH, and hence allows glycolysis to proceed (because the formation of NADH was an indispensable reaction in glycolysis), and hence, you have the anaerobic shift. Lactate doesn't pile as it has a favourable muscle-blood gradient and is quickly transported out the cell, and also because it has to pile up significantly before the enzyme forming it is back-logged. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to add the other regulations. What all other regulatory factors do, is to enhance this waterlogged feedback. Instead of the product piling up to a huge amount before the enzyme is inhibited, these regulations will allow a smaller pile-up to produce the feedback inhibition. So in essence, you can view the shift as a simple consequence of blocking the enzymatic chain at a particular level.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43727,"question_id":43701,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIqWF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19099,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19099/another-homo-sapien","reputation":1004,"display_name":"another 'Homo sapien'"},"score":1,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ay2bH.gif?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22057,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22057/david","reputation":1825,"display_name":"David"},"score":0,"post_id":43775,"edited":false,"creation_date":1456674356,"comment_id":75854,"body":"I think using end-product inhibition to illustrate the possible allosteric inhibition of early enzymes in aerobic respiration is misleading because 1. it would be the initial reactant (not the final one) \u2014 pyruvate that would build up, and 2.

The evidence here is indirect as the transporter was only identified and cloned in 2012.<\/p>\n\n<p>A simple description of feedback inhibition from <a href=\"http://www.buzzle.com/articles/what-is-feedback-inhibition-and-how-does-it-work.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/what-is-feedback-inhibition-and-how-does-it-work.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hJXSB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hJXSB.jpg\" alt=\"example of feedback inhibition\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So, as a summary of the whole process:<\/p>\n\n<p>Assume that no other regulations act except direct enzymatic feedback inhibition. This means that substrate being acted upon by an enzyme converting it to a product will stop being acted upon when the concentration of the product rises. Now, for the case in question. Lack of oxygen means that cytochrome c cannot work. Hence, it's substrate will accumulate, which is the product of the preceding enzyme, which will be blocked leading to the accumulation of its substrate and so on. This \"waterlogged\" system will continue leading to metabolite accumulation till pyruvate starts piling up. Now this pyruvate piling does something different because it had two enzymes that could act upon it. The other enzyme, which converts it to lactate does not have this feedback blockage and hence can function. So, the pyruvate is now converted into lactate, which requires NADH, and hence allows glycolysis to proceed (because the formation of NADH was an indispensable reaction in glycolysis), and hence, you have the anaerobic shift. Lactate doesn't pile as it has a favourable muscle-blood gradient and is quickly transported out the cell, and also because it has to pile up significantly before the enzyme forming it is backlogged.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to add the other regulations. What all other regulatory factors do, is to enhance this waterlogged feedback. Instead of the product piling up to a huge amount before the enzyme is inhibited, these regulations will allow a smaller pile-up to produce the feedback inhibition. So in essence, you can view the shift as a simple consequence of blocking the enzymatic chain at a particular level.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43775,"question_id":43701,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1456674694}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43701/how-does-the-body-switch-between-aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration","last_activity_date":1457908445,"creation_date":1456483339,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?","body":"<p>Lets take the case of a person doing heavy exercise.

(The kidney also has a small capacity for gluconeogenesis, but the reason for this is another question). The tissues consuming the glucose are predominantly <em>erythrocytes<\/em>, <em>brain and nervous tissue<\/em> and <em>muscle<\/em>, depending on the circumstances.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Resting post-absorptive \u2018lactate recycling\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Erythrocytes<\/em> have no mitochondria so can only respire by anaerobic glycolysis, reducing the pyruvate to lactate (in order to regenerate NAD<sup>+<\/sup>). The lactate goes into the blood, and is taken up by the <em>liver<\/em> and oxidized to pyruvate. Gluconeogenesis converts the pyruvate to glucose which passes back into the bloodstream, restoring that used by the erythrocytes. (The brain also uses glucose here but I\u2019ll deal with it below.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2018Lactate recycling\u2019 in exercise<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Muscle<\/em> has a certain aerobic capacity depending on type. However in vigorous exercise the skeletal muscle becomes anaerobic and obtains ATP for muscle contraction from aerobic glycolysis, again producing lactate. The <em>liver<\/em> glycolysis recycles this lactate to maintain the blood glucose, as in the previous section. (This overall co-ordination between tissues is often called \u2018Cori Cycle\u2019 in text books. However the name can be misleading, as it is not a chemical cycle like the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the urea cycle.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Starvation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In starvation the net supplies of energy will fall. However the one tissue that must be kept supplied with a glucose is the <em>brain<\/em> (even though it can obtain part of its energy requirements from other sources). <em>Liver<\/em> gluconeogenesis provides this, but substrates other than lactate are need to restore the glucose lost by net consumption after the liver glycogen reserves have been depleted. The main gluconeogenic precursors are a subset of amino acids from protein breakdown (the so-called glucogenic amino acids) which feed in at different parts of the pathway. Glycerol from the breakdown of triglycerides can also be used, but fatty acids themselves cannot, because they are converted to acetyl CoA, which condenses with oxaloacetate to feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and produces no net carbon skeleton that could be used for glycolysis.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PLANTS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I am not a plant biochemist, so I am happy to be corrected if wrong, but I understand that gluconeogenesis is important after seed germination for production of hexoses for use in cell wall polysaccharides during growth. Seeds contain reserves of fat, which on germination is oxidized to acetyl CoA which passes into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However plants (and some bacteria) are able to convert this to pyruvate by means of a pathway mammals lack \u2014 the glyoxylate cycle (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22383/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22383/<\/a>). So in plants the glucose produced is not being used to provide energy by oxidation, but as a biosynthetic precursor.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>BACTERIA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Gluconeogenesis is present in certain bacteria, where the pathway presumably arose (rather than in mammals). So it is of interest to consider its role there. Again, I am no bacteriologist, but the glyoxylate cycle is also present in bacteria, and it is likely that one function of gluconeogenesis would be to allow growth on fatty acids, with the glucose produced being required for synthesis of cell-wall polysaccharides.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44247,"question_id":31135,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1457869051}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/31135/what-is-the-purpose-of-gluconeogenesis","last_activity_date":1457881538,"creation_date":1428424832,"answer_count":3,"title":"What is the purpose of gluconeogenesis?","body":"<p>The gluconeogenesis pathway seems quite pointless to me.

Have you ever noticed when you jump into cold water, or enter a really cold shower you take a big breath?  While not exactly correlated with the dive reflex, it shows that there is a neurological reflex of entering cold water.  Here is a brief overview of what can happen when you submerge yourself in cold water:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lower heart rate - aka Bradycardia, slowing down the rate of blood pumped will decrease the oxygen requirement of red blood cells, which in turn allow organs like the brain to use oxygen. <\/li>\n<li>Smaller veins - aka Vasoconstriction, the blood flow in your fingers and toes is reduced, allowing more blood to be used in the more important organs.  Eventually the vasoconstriction will apply to hands and feet.  <\/li>\n<li>Blood shift - this adaptation allows the submerged animal to dive without having their thorax to collapse due to increased pressure.  Not necessarily attributing to breathing patterns though, so I left the boring stuff out and paraphrased.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>In hot water, the opposite happens with respect to #'s 1 and 2.  Increased heart rate, like when you go running, tends to increase breathing frequency.  Vasodilation allows blood to flow more easily and is primarily for heat exchange.

In nutrition, we usually mean the kilocalorie (kcal), which is the same as about 4.2 kJ (kilojoule). A average person needs about 2,000--2,500 kcal per day, but this of course varies quite a bit between people, depending on size (muscle mass, particularly) and level of physical activity (physical work, exercise).<\/p>\n\n<p>Nutrition guidelines found on the labels of food products give a pretty good summary of the amount of energy they contain. I'm not sure what applications you have been using, but they most likely rely on the same basic data, so the values should be similar. You can use these values to figure out roughly what your calorie intake is, and to spot very calorie-rich foods. But counting calories exactly is actually quite difficult --- you need to carefully weigh everything you eat and keep track of lots of numbers, and it's easy to make mistakes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Burning calories does not always mean burning fat. Fat is a long-term energy storage form in the body. When exercising, the body tends to burn stored carbohydrates (glycogen) first, and turns to burning fat when carbohydrates are exhausted. Therefore, prolonged, low-intensity exercise like long walks are usually better for burning fat than short \"sprint\" type of exercise. The body also burns fat during normal daily activity if your energy intake is lower than the daily need (when dieting). But it is also possible that some muscle mass is degraded (to amino acids) and used for energy as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>See also Wikipedia articles on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">food energy<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise\" rel=\"nofollow\">exercise<\/a>.

Most pregnant women with Zika virus exposure give birth to normal infants [111]. Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for a few days to a week, and thus far there is no evidence that a fetus conceived after the virus has cleared from the blood would be at risk for Zika infection [94,112]. However, information regarding the persistence of Zika virus following infection is not known. It has been suggested that infection due to other flaviviruses such as West Nile virus may persist years after initial infection [113-115]; these data are controversial.

Those women that carry a gene forcing them to commit suicide in order to improve the species won't pass on their genes, and in consequence no women will ever suicide in order to improve the species. In other words, altruistic behavior cannot appear and spread over time. This is the standard view of selection (and probably the good explanation in our case).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, I have to say that I lied in the previous paragraph! There is a field of study called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">social evolution<\/a> which aims to study social traits. Social traits are those traits which influence not only the fitness of the individual carrying the trait but also the fitness of other individuals in the population. Theoretically all traits are somehow social traits! Typically altruistic behavior is among those social traits that cause a decrease (a cost) in the carrier fitness for an advantage (a benefit) for one or several other individuals in the population. There are several models (which are still debated in particular concerning the assumptions of these models) to explain the evolution of such traits. The most famous, most commonly used and most theoretically studied one is Kin selection/Hamilton's rule. You'll find some explanations about this rule on <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/10742/what-if-rb-c-in-hamiltons-rule/10756#10756\">this post<\/a>. The concept of population structure is key in the understanding of Hamilton's rule. Also important are the concept of levels of selection, which gives a possible explanation for the evolution of altruism, the concept of lineage selection, and finally the concept of reciprocity (but that doesn't make much sense in the current context!). Some people would not classify these models as I did, some would add other models, some would melt two models into one\u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>For one of these models to be correct we would need high lineage split and extinctions in human history which I don't think is really the case. Or we'd need that the death of a woman is particularly benefit to her family. I don't think first human were cannibals. Women were probably very often pregnant and males had to fight to be the father. So dying would probably not free much opportunities for the sisters and brothers\u2026. One would need to write some equations and gather more information than what I have but intuitively I don't think that high mortality rate in women while giving birth is an altruistic behavior.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16446,"question_id":16441,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1457748542},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56b18dabcccffcff018833b11562a56d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6298,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6298/user44289","reputation":33,"display_name":"user44289"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1397108465,"creation_date":1397108465,"body":"<p>Human females have one of the worst  chidbirth experiences.

For the purposes of this discussion, let us say that there are two fluid compartments the ExtraCellular Fluid (ECF) and IntraCellular Fluid (ICF). Only the ECF contributes to blood volume and blood pressure. <\/p>\n\n<p>Na is not only the major ECF ion, but it is also confined there. The ICF concentration of Na is much lower than in the ECF, and it is continuously, invariably and actively kept out of the ICF. In other words, the vast majority of ingested Na ends up in the ECF, and drag the associated amount of water (ie volume, thereby increasing blood pressure). It is the opposite for K, which is mainly in the ICF. As for Cl, it is more or less equal in the ICF and ECF, and is allowed to move freely between them, meaning that you need to ingest twice as much as a given amount of Na for a similar effect on volume distribution. Bicarb is a minor ion, and moves freely between compartments. These are the reasons why, clinically, if someone is hypovolemic (ie dehydrated, losing blood) they are given a sodium based fluid or a protein based fluid (colloid), because both will drag volume and <em>stay<\/em> in the ECF.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the other part of your question, isn't it tightly regulated? Yes, but extra sodium takes some time to get excreted (much less than 1% of sodium that goes through the kidneys is excreted).

But these are relatively small amount of metal.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Its not that there is no metal available, but I can think of several reasons you don't see iron exoskeletons on animals all the time.  Firstly, fully reduced (oxidation state 0) metal has a high energetic cost to create in reduced form.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Iron is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust\" rel=\"nofollow\">second most common metal after aluminum on the earth's crust<\/a> but its almost entirely present in oxidized states - that's to say: as rust.  Most biological iron functions in the +2/+3 oxidation state, which is rust or closer to it than metal.  <a href=\"http://rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=82&amp;evtc=Suggest&amp;evta=Moleculeof%20the%20Month&amp;evtl=OtherOptions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cytochromes<\/a> and <a href=\"http://rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=41\" rel=\"nofollow\">haemoglobin<\/a> are examples of how iron is more valuable as a chemically active biological agent than a structural agent, using oxidized iron ions as they do. <a href=\"http://www.siliconfareast.com/ox_potential.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aluminium, the most common metal on earth has relatively little biological activity one might assume because its redox costs are even higher than iron<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If there are some reasons why reduced biometal doesn't show up very often, inability of biological systems to deposit reduced (metallic) metals is <em>not<\/em> one of them.  Bone and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950376\" rel=\"nofollow\">shell<\/a> are examples of biomineralization where the proteins depositing the calcium carbonate or other oxides in the material are structured by the proteins to be stronger than they would be as a simple crystal.  There are cases of admittedly small pieces of reduced metal being produced by biological systems. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotactic_bacteria#Magnetosomes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnetosomes<\/a> in magnetotactic bacteria are mentioned, but there are also cases of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v495/n7440_supp/full/495S12a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduced gold being accumulated by microorganisms<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I would say that while iron skeletons might seem to be an advantage, they are electrochemically unstable - oxygen and water will tend to oxidize (rust) them quickly and the organism would have to spend a lot of energy keeping it in working form.  Electrical conductivity sounds useful, but the nervous system favors exquisite levels of control over bulk current flow, even in cases like electric eels, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/70/9/2473.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">whose current is produced by gradients from acetylcholine<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What's more, it is a fact that biological materials actually perform as well as or better than metal when they need to.  Spider silk has a greater tensile strength than steel (along the direction of the thread). Mollusc shells are models for tank armor - they are remarkably resistant to puncture and breakage.  The time it would take for metalized structures to evolve biologically might be too long - by the time the metalized version of an organ or skeleton got started, the bones, shells and fibers we know probably have a big lead and selective advantage. <\/p>\n","answer_id":9420,"question_id":9419,"up_vote_count":38,"last_edit_date":1457242526},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GqkqP.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4101/amory","reputation":7383,"display_name":"Amory"},"score":12,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b81eca9fe11d9a8d01394c28ed5f4e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1070,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1070/cerberus","reputation":275,"display_name":"Cerberus"},"score":1,"post_id":9426,"edited":false,"creation_date":1374809222,"comment_id":12397,"body":"Thanks for your additions!

Most commonly, they are benign, but they can be associated with certain pathologies too, such as <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/amyotrophiclateralsclerosis/detail_ALS.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ALS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fasciculations are thought to originate due to spontaneous activation of muscle fibers due to processes in the motoneurons. At the axonal endings there are synapses that junction onto the muscle. The axonal tips of motoneurons are thought to be highly sensitive to depolarization (electrical firing), which is what triggers acetylcholine release and muscle contraction.  The complicated process itself takes a small fraction of a second.  If any of this happens involuntarily, then the muscle fiber contracts spontaneously (source: <a href=\"http://web.alsa.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ALSA_Ask_April2013\" rel=\"nofollow\">ALS Association<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, it is thought that spontaneous depolarization of motoneurons are the cause of fasciculations. This decreased firing threshold can be the cause of disease, disrupted ion homeostasis in the body, fatigue, drugs and other causes <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780896039964\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Blum &amp; Rutkove, 2007)<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Note that spontaneous / random activity in neurons is not only possible, it is quite common. Especially in neurons close to firing threshold, such as the motoneurons responsible for muscle activity, slight perturbations in ion concentrations inside or outside the cell can trigger an action potential. Further, channel opening is a stochastic process, meaning that even voltage-gated Na<sup>+<\/sup> channels can open without a depolarization being present; although the chance is slim that will happen, it can statistically still happen. Stochastic processes like this can cause neurons to fire spontaneously, without a stimulus being present.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780896039964\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blum &amp; Rutkove, <em>The Clinical Neurophysiology Primer<\/em>, Springer (2007)<\/a><\/sub> <\/p>\n","answer_id":44191,"question_id":44187,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1457729742}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44187/what-causes-spontaneous-muscle-twitches","last_activity_date":1457729742,"creation_date":1457682426,"answer_count":1,"title":"What causes spontaneous muscle twitches?","body":"<p>Sometimes a small region of my body starts shaking, without any reason and then stops abruptly.

Rh incompatibility is more dangerous, though.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a fetus is Rh+ and the mother is Rh-, when there is mixing of maternal-fetal blood (at birth, but sometimes before that), the mother will form antibodies to the blood cell surface antigen. It doesn't usually affect the first baby (not sufficient antibodies), but if a subsequent baby is Rh+, there can be major consequences, which are multiplied with repeated exposure. Those maternal antibodies - which cross the placenta - can attack the fetal red blood cells and cause destruction of many of them (called hemolytic anemia) which, if severe enough, can be fatal to the fetus. It was a not-uncommon cause of fetal demise before Rhogam (Rh immune globulin) injections.<\/p>\n\n<p>The immune globulin shots are given to women who are Rh- with Rh+ mates at a period before birth (before blood mixing), and immediately after birth if the child is Rh+. The antibodies bind with Rh+ antigens and \"mask\" the antigen from the mother's immune detection, so to speak, preventing the mother from making antibodies that can be used against subsequent pregnancies.<\/p>\n\n<p>The major risk is to the fetal blood cells, not the placenta.

The terms <strong><em>weak<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>strong<\/em><\/strong> Allee effects are in my experience used in a couple of different ways. Most often, <em>strong<\/em> density dependence is used to denote Allee effects where the per capita population growth rate can become negative, which means that there is a critical point in population size, below which the population will tend towards extinction. Weak Allee effects are then used to describe cases where the population growth rate is negatively affected by low population sizes, but where the per capita population growth rate cannot go below zero (so populations will grow at low population sizes). Remember that in the classic logistic model, per capita population growth rate is maximized when population size is low (limit towards N=0), while it is maximized between N=0 and N=K in models with an Allee effects (in the model includes a concept of carrying capacity). <\/p>\n\n<p>Using this definition of <em>weak<\/em> vs <em>strong<\/em>,  <strong>your model has a strong Allee effect<\/strong>, since per capita population growth rate will go below zero at the threshold <em>A<\/em> (see below). However, sometimes strong/weak is used to denote some sense of relative influence of the Allee effect on population dynamics, for instance if per capita population growth rate at low population sizes is decreased a lot or a little compared to the logistic model, even if both cases would correspond to a <em>weak<\/em> Allee effect in the first sense.<\/p>\n\n<p>For comparison, here are two examples of how an Allee effect can be modelled, that shows how the per capita growth rate is affected with an weak Allee effect (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519302930845\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boukal &amp; Berec 2002<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1468121812001393?np=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ferreira et al 2012<\/a>) or a strong Allee effect (your model):<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = \\frac{r}{K}N^2\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K} \\right) \\tag{weak}\\label{}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K} \\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{A}-1\\right) \\tag{strong}\\label{}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>If per capita population growth rate (dN/dtN) is plotted against population size for these two models, as well as for the standard logistic model, this is what you get:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0J5my.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0J5my.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In these examples, r=0.7, K=100 and A=20. As you can see, there is a big difference between the <em>weak<\/em> and <em>strong<\/em> case. The population growth rate (dN/dt) at different N is shown below:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/C1oH3.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/C1oH3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, if populations using the <em>strong<\/em> Allee effect are started below A (in this case 20) the populations will decline towards extinction (since dN/dt is negative below <em>A<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>The multi-species extension including species interactions that you propose looks ok to me, for that particular formulation of the Allee effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, for a flexible way to study the Allee effect, you might be interested in this formulation (see <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519302930845\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boukal &amp; Berec 2002<\/a>), which can produce both a strong and a weak behaviour:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K} \\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K}-\\frac{A}{K} \\right)\\tag{flex}\\label{}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>This function will produce a weak Allee effect if $A \\leq 0$ (very weak if A is far below 0) and a strong effect is $A&gt;0$. The <em>weak<\/em> model I give above is a special case of this formulation with $A = 0$. Per capita growth of this model is given below, for two values of <em>A<\/em> (with <em>r<\/em> = 0.5 for the logistic model and <em>r<\/em> = 0.38 for the <em>flex<\/em> models)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8T2jV.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8T2jV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>As a sidenote, I've also seen cases where negative density dependence at low population sizes is described as an Allee effect (so that Allee effect can be used to denote both positive and negative density dependence at low population sizes), but this is not very common. For a particular species, negative density dependence at low population sizes (in excess of what is found in the standard logistic model) could e.g. be found in situation where predators have a switching behaviour, so that they stop eating the prey when it becomes rare.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43595,"question_id":43570,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1457689547}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43570/population-dynamics-ode-with-allee-effects","last_activity_date":1457689547,"creation_date":1456170134,"answer_count":1,"title":"Population dynamics ODE with Allee Effects","body":"<p>From reading about Allee effects, it appears that there is a modification of the one-dimensional logistic equation to account for an allee effect given by:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K} \\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{A}-1\\right)$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Here, $r$ is the species growth rate, $K$ is the carrying capacity, and $A$ is the threshold for the population to not go extinct $(0&lt;A&lt;K)$.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few questions about this model:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) What is it in this equation that determines whether or not the allee effect is strong or weak?
