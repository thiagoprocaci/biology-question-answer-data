It is avascular (no blood vessels), and the non-mylenated nerve endings are very tiny and present in the epithelium.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transplanting this relatively simple tissue is easy (well, not do-it-at-home easy, but easy.) The only problem with cutting all those nerve endings is that the new cornea will feel nothing if there's dust in the eye, etc. This is a problem, but nothing compared to blindness.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This is a diagram of a cross section of the retina<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KBYrq.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, it is not nearly as simple as the cornea. The nerves (to the left: yellow, light blue, medium blue and darker blue), which collect information from the rods and cones (pink and purple) are very numerous, and absolutely vital to the ability of the brain to interpreting information from these photoreceptors. Therefore, a cut piece of retina immediately loses the ability to send any information to the brain. To transplant it into an eye with a damaged retina would do nothing to improve vision. Also, it is not easy surgery. It's <em>very<\/em> difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>What has been called \"retinal transplants\" in the recent past have been tiny pieces of embryonic retina, about...<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4 millimetre square of retinal tissue, complete with retinal progenitor cells and the retinal pigment epithelium that nourishes them. The tissues were placed in the sub-retinal space beneath the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for sharp central vision.  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Note, they didn't try to connect nerves or blood vessels. And, it came from <em>an embyro<\/em> (so the supply is a problem.) The improvement in vision - which was significant in 7 out of 8 recipients (one patient going from 20/800 to 20/160) - is not long lasting, and believed to have been not from the transplanted retina connecting to the existing retina, but from the release of growth factors from the embryonic tissue improving the health of the degenerating retina.<\/p>\n\n<p>The newest in \"retinal transplants\" (which might be better called stem-cell-supplied growth factors implanted in the retina) actually derives from the patient's own stem cells:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Japanese woman in her 70s is the first person to receive tissue derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, a technology that has created great expectations since it could offer the same regenerative potential as embryo-derived cells but without some of the ethical and safety concerns. [No news yet on whether it worked.] <\/p>\n  \n  <p>In a two-hour procedure... a team of three eye specialists lead by Yasuo Kurimoto of the Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital implanted a 1.3 by 3.0 millimetre sheet of retinal pigment epithelium cells into an eye of the Hyogo prefecture resident, who suffers from age-related macular degeneration, a common eye condition that can lead to blindness.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>TL;DR: It's not as easy as taking cadaver retina and replacing a patients retina (that would result in immediate and permanent blindness).

The issue with doing this with cells is the sheer number of variables.<\/p>\n\n<p>For any given cell, the following <em>internal<\/em> variables exist:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Internal ion concentrations for dozens of ions of importance importance<\/li>\n<li>Internal concentrations of hundreds or thousands of various simple organic molecules, including \"raw\" internalised molecules, various steps in dozens or even hundreds of metabolic processes, and metabolic end-products and by-products.<\/li>\n<li>Internal concentrations of hundreds or thousands of different proteins and other complex biological \"mechanical parts\", as well as the states of these \"parts\".<\/li>\n<li>The physical state of the cell - stretched, contracted, relaxed, hot, cold, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This list is not exhaustive.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting that the above variables may also exist for multiple separate \"compartments\" within the cell; vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus being three which come to mind immediately.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other issue is that cells do not exist in a vacuum; the external environment plays an important role in their functioning. The human body is at any one moment existing in direct contact and interaction with the following extracellular environments:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The atmosphere (Mainly, but not only, temperature exchange)<\/li>\n<li>The air within the respiratory system, including nose and mouth<\/li>\n<li>Stomach contents<\/li>\n<li>Small intestine contents (which would need to be considered in several segements, since the nature of the interaction changes along the path of the small intestine.<\/li>\n<li>Large intestine contents<\/li>\n<li>Blood<\/li>\n<li>Cerebrospinal fluid (Fluid found \"inside\" the brain)<\/li>\n<li>Extracellular fluid, or \"tissue fluid\" (A separate compartment for each small swatch of tissue in the body)<\/li>\n<li>Lymph<\/li>\n<li>Pleural fluid (Fluid surrounding the lungs; a separate compartment for each lung)<\/li>\n<li>Pericardial fluid (A small amount of fluid surrounding the heart)<\/li>\n<li>Joint capsule contents (A separate compartment for each joint)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>...and the list goes on. Each of these compartments requires tracking of the same variables as individual cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is yet further complicated by the fact that some of these compartments can't easily be considered as one big compartment, because of the importance of spatial relations. For example, the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations of blood (as well as the concentrations of other substances like alcohol) change centimeter-to-centimeter. Yet another issue is the fact that cells are not static in terms of their relations to each other; red blood cells move with blood flow, and experience turbulence and other effects, and other cells (like macrophages) are capable of \"deliberate\" movement in the blood and in tissue.<\/p>\n\n<p>You would also have to account for physical disturbances - things like a stab wound or even a pinprick are ludicrously complex at a cellular level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, human beings are very complex organisms, and there exist much simpler organisms.

The cell is a computational device in the sense that the outcomes of its activity are computable functions of its inputs (a reasonable hypothesis), but more than that: at the cell level there is no distinction between the computer, the program which runs on the computer, input and output data AND the execution of the program.

Being a matter of principle, it cannot be proved rigorously, but it might be given a rigorous support by constructing simple proofs of principle models. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are many computing models which are inspired by chemistry, therefore in return they can be seen as such proof of principles. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction_network_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemical Reaction Networks and Petri Nets models<\/a> which are more like structuring tools than real embodied models of computation, because they don't consider the structure of molecules (they are just nodes in a graph), nor the way chemical reactions happen (they are edges in a graph). They are very useful tools though and the description given here is very much simplified. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is the CHAM (chemical abstract machine), <a href=\"http://hal-institut-mines-telecom.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/75426/filename/RR-1133.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">G. Berry and G. Boudol. The chemical abstract machine. Theoretical Computer Science, 96(1):217\u2013248, 1992<\/a>. In this model states of the machine (imagine: a cell) \"are chemical solutions where floating molecules can interact according to reaction rules\" (cite from the abstract). In this model \"solution\" means a multiset of molecules, reaction rules are between molecules and they do not apply inside molecules. This is a limitation of the model because the structure of the molecule is not as important as the number of molecules in a species. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another very interesting model is the <a href=\"http://fontana.med.harvard.edu/www/Documents/WF/Papers/alchemy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Algorithmic Chemistry of Fontana and Buss<\/a>. The main idea is that chemistry and computation are basically the same. The reasoning goes as following. There are two pillars of the rigorous notion of computation: the Turing Machine (well known) and Church's lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is less known outside computer science, but is a formalism which may be more helpful to chemists, or biologists even, than the Turing machine.  Fontana and Buss propose that lambda calculus is a kind of chemistry, in the sense that the its basic operations, namely abstraction and application, can be given chemical analogies. Molecules are like mathematical functions, abstractions are like reaction sites and applications are like chemical reactions. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Algorithmic Chemistry is almost as closer as possible to be (proof of principle) answer to the question. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally I mention <a href=\"https://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/demos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">chemlambda<\/a>, or the <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/alife14/ch079.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemical concrete machine<\/a>, which is like Algorithmic Chemistry, but it is far more concrete. Molecules are graphs, applications and abstractions are molecules, chemical reactions are graph rewrites. <\/p>\n\n<p>What is very interesting in all these models, in my opinion, is that they suggest that answering to the question \"Can we understand a cell as an organic computational device?\" is somehow relevant to the Computer Science question \"How to design an asynchronous, decentralized Internet?\".<\/p>\n","answer_id":30231,"question_id":30227,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1425813856}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30227/can-all-biological-processes-be-understood-as-computations-and-studied-as-such","last_activity_date":1425847025,"creation_date":1425806371,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can all biological processes be understood as computations and studied as such?","body":"<p>Can we understand a cell as an organic computational device?

I added 2 µl of calcium (2 mM), magnesium (2 mM) and manganese (2 mM) ions respectively to three reaction mixtures and had a control that was made up to an equal volume with Tris-HCl.

I was unsure of how far the Mg2+ would travel as I thought it would have a lower affinity to the calmodulin due to its binding to the N-terminus rather than the C-terminus.

Just to make it clear people with DS do have a reduced risk of solid cancers and an increased risk of blood cancers, (B-ALL and AML).<\/p>\n\n<p>You are correct in picking out DSRC1 because of its angiogenic implications. The current hypothesis centers around people with DS being less capable of driving angiogenesis, and therefore having an internal environment that is less nurturing to metastasized or even developing solid cancers. Current unpublished work I have recently seen shows this very clearly in the eye, where the vasculature in DS is far less branched than in the wild-type population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why however they show an increased risk of leukemias is a largely unanswered question, with one exception being AMKL (Acute Megakaryocytic Leukemia). People with DS are at a ~500X increased risk of AMKL over the unafected population, and it appears to be entirely driven by the in-utero introduction of a stop mutation in codon 2 the transcription factor GATA1. This transcription factor is important in driving differentiation of progenitor cells in the bone marrow to become erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. Thus inactivating this transcription factor plays a large role in disrupting normal hematopoiesis such that megakaryocytes are overproduced and become a leukemia.<\/p>\n\n<p>All that being said, and as you mentioned people with DS have around a 20-50X increased risk of AML and B-ALL. There are certainly some chromosome 21 genes that have been implicated in this like Bach1 (important in DNA repair) Ifngr2 (plays a role in cell death) Usp16 (epigenetic regulator <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7467/full/nature12530.html\">Really important recent Nature Paper<\/a>) and Runx1 (important in stress response) but the field is entirely unsure why this directly leads to increased risk of leukemias. Many current cancer biologists favor the direct gene-dosage problem that people with DS face in that a some ~120 genes are overexpressed when they shouldn't be, and assume that these gene level cocktail directly leads to this increased risk of leukemogenesis, and this very well may be in part the answer. There is however a great 'contrarian' view, in that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells will become pro-apoptotic and pro-differentiative when faced with certain stresses like aneuploidy. The effect of this on a global scale would be that many of the stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow would die or differentiate prematurely. This would then result in teenagers with DS having far fewer blood stem cells then they should, and these cells would then be tasked with pumping out more blood per cell than originally meant for them quite possibly leading to an exhaustive phenotype. In this way the blood systems of people with DS will 'prematurely age', and might thus rapidly increase the risk of cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make sense?<\/p>\n","answer_id":30202,"question_id":30191,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1425673923}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30191/why-do-people-with-down-syndrome-get-fewer-cancers","last_activity_date":1425756714,"creation_date":1425610204,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do people with Down syndrome get fewer cancers?","body":"<p>I'm coming across some conflicting information regarding the correlation between cancer incidents and trisomy 21.

You used all offsprings when you made the division so 2/4 = 1/2.Your teachers 2/3 comes from the fact that 3 out of four is black, but only 2 out of that 3 black is heterozygote so 2/3 is good by this logic. I think that your teacher's logic faulty because you have to take into consideration all the offsprings. Basic genetics and Mendel's law tells us that crossing two heterozygotes with independent alleles result in a 3:1 ratio in phenotype separation in the next generation with 1:2:1 genotype separation -- that is what basically both of you have wrote. The fault is in the getting the probability - basic maths tells us that in an independent experiment, the probability variables have to sum up to one.

When the RNA is nuclease protected then how can it be accessible to ligase. When I was thinking about it then I thought that a partial protein degradation was necessary (after RNAse step and before ligase step) to give some space for ligase to act. Eventually I did not work on it further. Three years later CLASH paper was published and I was happy that someone made it work. But the ligase issue was not addressed (It seems to have worked but I don't know how!!). <\/p>\n\n<p>To test the predictions you can use a reporter assay (such as GFP or Luciferase) with the 3'UTR cloned downstream of the reporter. These can have artifacts too. Overexpressing the miRNA should be avoided and seed mutations should be done to ascertain the targetability. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another technique to determine a target mRNA is to mask its predicted miRNA binding site and see the effect on the expression. This has been done in zebrafish using morpholinos complementary to target sites but not on other models AFAIK. This seems to me as an elegant assay- no overexpression and you can precisely determine the target site.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23501,"question_id":23452,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1414473707}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23452/how-to-find-mirna-binding-sites-on-a-specific-gene","last_activity_date":1425567288,"creation_date":1414248839,"answer_count":2,"title":"How to find miRNA binding sites on a specific gene?","body":"<p>I am trying to find miRNAs that bind to the 3'UTR of a specific gene.

The krebs cycle is an essential step in the generation of ATP in aerobic organisms. (B) is incorrect because NADH is never transported into the mitochondria in any organism (it is a nonsense answer). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nNADH is not transported into mitochondria. Instead, its electrons are transported into mitochondria, and I quote from <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4uwf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berg et al. (2002)<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NADH cannot simply pass into mitochondria for oxidation by the respiratory chain, because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. The solution is that electrons from NADH, rather than NADH itself, are carried across the mitochondrial membrane. One of several means of introducing electrons from NADH into the electron transport chain is the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle (Figure 18.37).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4uwf.jpg\" alt=\"e- shuttle\">  <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Electrons from NADH can enter the mitochondrial electron transport chain by being used to reduce dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate. Glycerol 3-phosphate is reoxidized by electron transfer to an FAD prosthetic group in a membrane-bound glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Subsequent electron transfer to Q to form QH2 allows these electrons to enter the electron-transport chain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, (B) is incorrect.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong>: Now why would lactate be formed in (A)? Pyruvate builds up in the cell, as it cannot be transported into the mitochondria.

This mixture is known as 'Gas and Air' and is in very common use.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The active ingredient in Entonox is of course the nitrous oxide, so the discussion of the mechanism below refers solely to the N<sub>2<\/sub>O as you asked for.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nitrous oxide enters the blood by diffusion from the alveoli whilst it is being inhaled, but does not bind with haemoglobin.  It is fat soluble so quickly moves into cells, including synapse ends in the brain.  Because of the stability of the compound, N<sub>2<\/sub>O is not metabolised by the body so has its effect as that molecule, then is eliminated by diffusion out of the lungs once inhalation has ceased (taking roughly 2 minutes for on and offset).  <\/p>\n\n<p>According to the material that BOC pharmaceuticals provide, the exact mechanism of the analgesia is not <em>fully<\/em> understood.  It <em>is<\/em> known, however, to induce \"inconsistent changes in the basal levels of thalamic nuclei\".  <\/p>\n\n<p>N<sub>2<\/sub>O inhibits NMDA receptors in the brain whilst simultaneously encouraging the stimulation of the parasympathetic GABA receptors.  This eventually produces an anaesthetic effect.  It is also understood that N<sub>2<\/sub>O promotes the release of endogenous opioid neurotransmitters ('natural painkillers' e.g. endorphins) that specifically activate <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034378\">descending pain pathways<\/a>.  This inhibits the transmission of pain.  In this way the analgesia provided by nitrous oxide is antinociceptive (literally pain reducing) rather than a generalised limbic depressor.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, nitrous oxide also positively effects potassium ion channels too <sup>[<a href=\"http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/65/2/443.short\">ref<\/a>]<\/sup> - reducing the chance of an action potential being generated in affected neurons.  Research into this area of the effects of N<sub>2<\/sub>O is ongoing.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Euphoria is a common side effect of N<sub>2<\/sub>O usage, hence the name laughing gas.  This is as part of wider emotional changes that can occur when nitrous oxide is being administered.  For example, some people instead of laughing become scared or in other cases extremely aggressive towards those nearby. The emotional excitement may result in depressive or manic behaviour even to the point of psychosis and hallucinations especially in those who have a preexisting vulnerability to mental illness.

From a quiet place on the countryside in Sweden, I moved to Manchester for my studies. When I first arrived there, I felt the city was very noisy, a feeling which gradually reduced as I presumably got used to the noise levels there. From Manchester I moved over to Saitama in Japan, an enormous city right next to Tokyo with a considerable amount of noise during the day, and buildings that have little to no sound insulation. With the exception of particularly loud noises, I again adapted to the sound levels in the country, which at the time, I felt was no more than a natural response in terms of how much attention we pay to the noise. If I'm distracted by work or other activities, I have little reason to dwell on the sounds of driving cars and talking people. <\/p>\n\n<p>The thing I couldn't explain purely by the 'paying attention' argument however was when I moved back to the Netherlands, to an apartment with excellent sound insulation. My apartment is located in front of a somewhat larger road, and cars pass by almost consistently. However, when I moved in I could barely hear these cars driving past, something that stood out to me as fairly pleasant. I thought a little bit of ambient music would kill the sound of these vehicles driving past altogether. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now skip ahead one month, and I can hear the cars almost as if I'm standing next to them, an exaggeration of course, but the sound is much clearer than it was when I moved in. I know that nothing has changed in terms of insulation and I know that no windows are open. Strangely the only thing that appears to have changed is the clarity in which I perceive this noise, as none of the other people whom I've asked seem to share the same opinion (that is, that the noise has grown louder).

The effect of this is that every new B and T cell that your bone marrow makes will recognize a unique, random protein sequence, and you will have billions of these cells floating around in your blood circulation at any given time. These cells however will only float around in circulation for a short period of time before dying and being replaced by other cells with new random sequence receptors.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you get a vaccination, you are injecting in specific protein sequences from a specific pathogen. As these injected protein sequences circulate through your blood they will eventually bump into a B or T cell that has a receptor that recognizes them.

These cells will float around in your blood for most of your life and make you 'immune' to the recognized pathogen.

For example, a signal the cell receives could cause an exon that is normally included to be skipped, or an intron that is normally spliced out to be left in for translation (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing#Modes\">Wikipedia article<\/a> on the subject has a basic overview of the possibilities). This would not be possible, or at least would be much more difficult, without the presence of introns.<\/li>\n<li>In recent years, we have discovered that RNA molecules (especially <strong>small RNAs<\/strong> such as siRNAs and miRNAs) are much more involved in regulating gene expression than previously thought. Often the small regulatory RNAs are derived from spliced introns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There is probably more, but essentially introns enable a finer level of regulatory control. Biological complexity is often not the result of having a larger complement of genes, but of having additional layers of regulation to turn genes on and off at the right times. Prokaryotic genes are often organized into operons, and a single polycistronic mRNA will often encode multiple proteins from multiple adjacent genes. Since the biological processes required to sustain microbial life are much less complicated than those required to sustain eukaryotic life, they can get away with much less regulatory control.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1725,"question_id":1724,"up_vote_count":26},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYLoD.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1265,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1265/onur-d","reputation":329,"display_name":"Onur D."},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b77a5b0214128179e948ad8d73146adb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":117,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/117/dsign","reputation":276,"display_name":"dsign"},"score":2,"post_id":3237,"edited":false,"creation_date":1345446400,"comment_id":4853,"body":"I was explaining it to my girlfriend: imagine you have two rooms in your two-and-a-kitchen house full of cartridges of adhesive tape... you really don&#39;t need it, but have no way of getting rid of it.

This generates some sound and some change in light. In the case of forward sighted animals, the sound is much more difficult to detect than the light would be as it contains less energy. The ears must compensate by detecting lower energy signals than the eyes would need to in order to detect the predator.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Before we question the physics, this biological hypothesis is very tough to swallow. Without citation I would say it is unreasonable conjecture.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Examples that contradict this hypothesis:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Gorillas<\/strong> have no natural predators or prey but have a very similar sensory setup to ours that helps social bonds. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Meerkats<\/strong> on the other hand rely on sentries that broadcast a series of bleats after spotting prey by sight. Other meerkats immediately hide when hearing this signal (interestingly, this call is mimicked by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9149000/9149950.stm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drongos<\/a> who steal the meerkat food that is abandoned in the panic) before checking if a predator is present. Meerkats have a similar sensory setup to ours.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>There are other megafauna like <strong>deer<\/strong> that are prey for the big predators; predators that would have put ancestral humans on the menu. Deer-like prey animals rely heavily on near-omnidirectional eyesight and can angle their ears to focus on an area to hear stealthy predators. This is the \"opposite\" sensory setup that has the same conclusion of predator evasion. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Even those non-exhaustive examples makes the hypothesis <strong>questionable at best<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...there is a range in which \"interesting\" signals occur. If the interesting signals have lower energy for sound than for visual signals the ear adapted to this range.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer too is based on pure conjecture it seems, however <strong>it more aligns with how biology might work<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is sensible to say evolution selected for animals that could detect noises and lights that, if reacted to, saved the organisms life to continue propagating. This hypothesis bypasses the idea that sound and light are comparable energetic signals too, which is good (discussed below). <\/p>\n\n<p>This hypothesis also allows for various morphologies to have evolved depending on what an \"interesting signal\" is to that species.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Light vs Sound.<\/h2>\n\n<p><em>These aren't the same thing.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The elephant in the room of this question is that <strong>light and sound are non-comparable<\/strong> energies.

Whole blood (not necessarily warm) is used more often when there is massive blood loss, as it contains all the components of blood: clotting factors, platelets, plasma, etc. Packed red blood cells have had the white blood cells removed, most of the plasma, the platelets, etc. It is indicated for routine blood loss and to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. The constituents of each are different.<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary problems of stored blood viability are red blood cell deformability (red cells are normally very flexible in order to pass through capillaries) and red blood cell fragility (this results in fewer RBCs actually active in the recipient, as RBCs will break apart.) The viability of RBCs in storage depend on factors such as adequate ADP (the energy substrate). When RBSs are less viable for any reason (less deformable, more fragile, or hemolysis has started in the stored blood), this is termed red cell (or red blood cell/rbc) storage lesion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though there are probably many questions you may have about storage methods and viability, this will give you an idea of search terms for your reading.

For example; I have read papers about results of blood storage on blood quality etc. But these papers just analyze the effects, while it is not clear for me if these analyzed materials represents viability of blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>For more detail, things those analyzed in few papers that I have read are; <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>CBC: The CBC consisted of 10 parameters: white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet (PLT) count, and mean platelet volume (MPV).<\/li>\n<li>Differantial: consisted of relative percentages (%) and absolute numbers (#) of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.<\/li>\n<li>Reticulocyte: The reticulocyte enumeration consisted of relative percentage (retic %) and absolute number of reticulocytes (retic #), and immature reticulocyte fraction(IRF). <\/li>\n<li>The NRBC: enumeration consisted of NRBC per 100 WBC (NRBC %) and absolute number of NRBC.<\/li>\n<li>Others: Factors V, VII, VIII, X, and XI, protein S (PS), a2-antiplasmin (AP), and fibrinogen; and the activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) and prothrombin (PT) times.

It's valid to have a cladogram with a single character (e.g. the single character, \"warm-blooded\"), but you will need at least two character states to infer a non-trivial cladogram. The states for the character warm-blooded would be Yes or No.<\/p>\n\n<p>A molecular example would be a cladogram inferred from a column of a sequence alignment. That <em>column<\/em> is the character, and for, say, DNA, the character states are the set {A,C,G,T}.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then the outgroup of various species are identified based on the sequencing or closeness of the derived characters in the clades.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The outgroup is specified by you, the investigator. It's typically a hypothesis (viz. model parameter), which is either a guess or is based on some external evidence.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, the analysis starts from character-state data for some number of taxa (\"species\" in your paragraph). From this data you are selecting (constructing) a tree-topology that best fits this data.<\/p>\n\n<p>E.g. for four taxa, labeled A,B,C,D, with D the outgroup, the process is like:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code> start  --&gt; cladogram\n ABC(D)     A  B C (D)\n             \\/ / /\n              \\/ /\n               \\/\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>There are many different methods to construct the cladogram. One popular method is  maximum parsimony, but the assumptions of that model are severe. However, <em>any<\/em> method is effectively selecting a tree topology out of all the finitely-many possible tree topologies over N leaves, where N is the number of taxa (species) in your investigation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In making a cladogram, ______ assume that groups that _____ more derived characters have a more close common ancestor.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In this sentence, you seem to be expressing a relationship between the number of shared derived characters (synapomorphies) for a given clade, and the common ancestor of that clade.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be very confusing, maybe an example will help. Let me annotate the above tree with a binary character, having states + and -. <\/p>\n\n<pre><code>            +   +  -   - \n            A   B  C  (D)\n             \\ /  /   /\n              +  /   /\n               \\/   /\n                -  /                   \n                 \\/\n                  -\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The idea is that the ancestral state for the entire group is -, as was the state for the ancestor of {A,B,C}. However, the + state was derived after the ancestor of {A,B,C} but before (or \"in\") the ancestor of {A,B}. Then it was passed to the terminal units, A and B. (Note: typically you don't have this ancestral-state information, only the information at the tips of the tree. You're actually inferring the ancestral states and topology <strong>from<\/strong> the data at the tips.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I would claim that, in general, taxa that share more derived character (states) have a more recent common ancestor than taxa that do not.

Many striated (skeletal) muscles work this way, i.e., with antagonistically paired muscles."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12086f42e1380495f6b35592ce60b0e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11652,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11652/stan-shunpike","reputation":819,"display_name":"Stan Shunpike","accept_rate":70},"score":0,"post_id":30012,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"edited":false,"creation_date":1425113263,"comment_id":49107,"body":"These folks would seem to disagree: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29655/do-both-ends-of-a-muscle-contract\" title=\"do both ends of a muscle contract\">biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29655/&hellip;<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"post_id":30012,"edited":false,"creation_date":1425117768,"comment_id":49112,"body":"They don&#39;t disagree with me and I not with them as far as I can see, it&#39;s kind of a huge post.

The ribosome just keeps moving along the mRNA and producing a polypeptide unless it encounters a stop codon.

They're not essential to an individual's life. You wouldn't die (dispensing with the \"how\" right off the bat.) You'd be just fine if no bacteria reentered your body. Your fecal output would be greater; you would derive somewhat less nutrition from your food, you would need to take vitamin K, and there would be an adjustment period, but theoretically, you'd be just fine. You might even be healthier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your hypothetical is impossible, of course, because experimentation on humans is unethical. However, it might surprise you to learn that there are colonies of germ-free animals (also called <em>gnotobiotic<\/em>) used to study the effect of certain bacteria on animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The derivation of such subjects was initially fairly gruesome.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The process of engineering biology and machine began by removing intact uteruses from near- to full-term pregnant animals within a purpose-built germ-free \"surgical isolator.\" The uterus was subsequently passed through various disinfection procedures, involving total immersion in germicide-filled \"dunk tanks,\" before the progeny were surgically released and hand reared within a second microbially sterile isolator.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These animals are costly to keep, as you can imagine. The originals must be delivered by Cesarean section, and housed and raised in sterile conditions. But once you can do that, they can multiply. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To start a germ-free colony, one must remove a young animal from its mother\u2019s womb through a careful surgical procedure to avoid exposing it to the microorganisms in the mother\u2019s vagina and skin. Then, the animal is raised in a sterile cage and only exposed to food, water, and other equipment that has also been sterilized. On a weekly basis\u2014or more often\u2014a technician swabs cages and animal feces to ensure that no bacteria have contaminated the sterile housing. Once the colony has been created, it becomes easier to rear new germ-free animals; a germ-free mother can give birth naturally without exposing her newborns to any bacteria.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>By the 1950s, researchers were rearing germ-free mice, rats, guinea pigs, and chicks inside sterile stainless steel (and later, plastic) housings. Germ-free animals are especially useful in researching, among other things, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, obesity, genetic engineering, cancer, immunology, nutrition, and the effects of normal intestinal flora on health.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vitamin K must be added to their diets, and it is important to sterilize their food without destroying nutrients, but otherwise they do well in their environments. Their feces, of course, are sterile. Everything is microbe-free. They also have no \"normal\" antibodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since generations of germ-free animals can exist and multiply, it is not only possible but quite likely that germ-free humans can exist as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which is not to say that gut (and skin, etc.) microbiomes are unimportant. If you release a germ-free animal into a normal environment, it can die if it picks up pathogenic bacteria before more normal gut flora. To do this safely, a germ-free animal is first given a cocktail of bacteria to colonize the gut. After a while, they can be in a normal environment without problems.

Type 1 diabetes is commonly called as Juvenile diabetes or Brittle diabetes.\nIt is also called as \"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)\". For our bad-luck the causes of Type 1 diabetes remains obscure, and scientists believes its mostly related to genetics and other environmental factors like mutations or virus attacks. I found some articles that may help.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But it\n  is believed that genetic and environmental factors (possibly viruses)\n  may be involved. The aetiology ('cause') of type 1 diabetes is\n  unknown, but a good deal is known about its pathogenesis (the way in\n  which it develops). As with other complex diseases, the outcome is\n  determined by the interplay of multiple genes and (most likely)\n  multiple environmental determinants, together with an element of\n  happenstance. The risk of developing diabetes is strongly influenced\n  by genes affecting immune function, particularly the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" rel=\"nofollow\">HLA system<\/a>,\n  but other factors are involved. The best evidence for this comes from\n  the study of identical twins: if one twin develops diabetes in\n  childhood, the other (who has identical genes) has no more than a one\n  in three chance of developing the disease. Prospective studies in\n  human populations reveal that circulating auto antibodies directed\n  against the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans\" rel=\"nofollow\">islets<\/a> typically appear in the first 5 years of life, and\n  may be present for many years (sometimes 20 years or more) before the\n  disease develops. A similar latent period is seen with coeliac\n  disease, and implies that some sort of regulatory balance has been\n  achieved within the immune system, and subsequently lost. This opens\n  the door to the possibility of 're-education' of the immune system by\n  various forms of immune intervention.\n  <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8SahffUIrC0J:www.diapedia.org/type-1-diabetes-mellitus/pathogenesis%20&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The pathogenesis of Diabetes mellitus type 1 shows a strong tendency towards genetic related factors,\n  <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y4YcK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n  <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00063030-200115050-00002#page-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":29988,"question_id":29974,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29974/detailed-mechanism-of-the-cause-of-diabetes-mellitus-type-1","last_activity_date":1425149913,"creation_date":1424971525,"answer_count":1,"title":"Detailed mechanism of the cause of diabetes mellitus type 1?","body":"<p>I have read in some texts that diabetes mellitus type 1 is caused by degeneration of beta cells due to our body's own immune reaction.Is it true?

Roughly, populations in Africa are most genetically variable as they are the oldest (they have been there for the longest time in human evolutionary history and therefore there was a long time for mutations to accumulate in their genomes). Because all the other populations in the world have originated from these original African populations, they have a subset of that original variation - they are less variable. The further you get from Africa the less variation remains (a very simplistic scenario: a group of Africans left and settled down in the Middle East; then a group of Middle Easterners went further up to Europe and further east to India; then the Indians moved further north and east etc. etc.; in each stage, only a subset of the previous variation would be travelling along).<\/p>\n\n<p>A famous image depicting this phenomenon is in Ramachandran, S. et al. (2005). Support from the relationship of genetic and geographic distance in human populations for a serial founder effect originating in Africa. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(44), 15942\u201315947. doi:10.1073/pnas.0507611102 figure 1B<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zUo3j.png\" alt=\"[Source](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/44/15942)\"><\/p>\n\n<p>On the Y axis you have a measure of genetic relatedness (more relatedness = less variation) and on the X axis you have rough geographic distance that takes into account major geographic barriers (like seas etc.). Green is Eurasia and blue is Australia and Oceania. Red is variation within the groups (so, Europeans only, Australians only etc.) The variation  between the populations explained by this geographic distance is close to 80% - which is huge. If I get this right, it means that most of the genetic differences between people in different populations are a simple consequence of living outside Africa. And the variation within each population is tiny (12%) compared to the between population.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a simplified view, because we now know that there were other species of humans that lived when our ancestors left Africa, and that thay had sex together as our ancestors spread around the globe, so a small portion of the others' DNA is still present in us today. Also this picture may be slightly different depending on what region of the genome you're looking at. But the major picture stands.<\/p>\n\n<p>Going back to your question - \"Asians\" (populations with ancestry in east Asia) are on average less genetically homogenous than \"Australians\" or \"Americans\", but more than \"Africans\".<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A paper I like that should explain all this much better: Barbujani, G., &amp; Colonna, V.
