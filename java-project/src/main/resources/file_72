For instance, if you couple the ATP -> ADP reaction to a certain protein, the energy can be used to modify the shape of that protein.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2052,"question_id":2051,"up_vote_count":16},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1670879794aed7c23742e5b1f759be94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1136/tomd","reputation":2087,"display_name":"TomD"},"score":20,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff3e84bcedd40163c74d33b827ac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/307/lancelafontaine","reputation":3814,"display_name":"LanceLafontaine","accept_rate":47},"score":3,"post_id":2903,"edited":false,"creation_date":1342897034,"comment_id":4342,"body":"A clear, comprehensive answer filled with examples. +1."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1670879794aed7c23742e5b1f759be94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1136,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1136/tomd","reputation":2087,"display_name":"TomD"},"score":0,"post_id":2903,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cff3e84bcedd40163c74d33b827ac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/307/lancelafontaine","reputation":3814,"display_name":"LanceLafontaine","accept_rate":47},"edited":false,"creation_date":1342899748,"comment_id":4343,"body":"@LanceLafontaine Thanks!"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c66c4d97a7bc3859a85253f003e1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"moderator","user_id":6,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6/mad-scientist","reputation":6781,"display_name":"Mad Scientist","accept_rate":55},"score":0,"post_id":2903,"edited":false,"creation_date":1360238642,"comment_id":8690,"body":"The answer was automatically converted to CW because you edited it more than 10 times.

Such reactions may be considered <em>coupled<\/em> (see, for example, Silby &amp; Alberty (2001), quoted below). <\/p>\n\n<p>An example is the reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12; GAPDH) [see <a href=\"http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC1/2/1/12.html\">here] <\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<pre> Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + NAD<sup>+<\/sup> + P<sub>i<\/sub> → 1,3-diPhosphoGlycerate + NADH + H<sup>+<\/sup> <\/pre>\n\n<p>We can think of this reaction in terms of two separate reactions which are coupled mechanistically by the enzyme. (i) The NAD<sup>+<\/sup> linked oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid (the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction) and (ii) the phosphorylation of a carboxylic acid. (Like ATP, a phosphorylated carboxylic acid may be considered a 'high energy' compound, that is one where the equilibrium for hydrolysis lies very much to the left in reaction 2 below). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reaction 1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre> RCHO + NAD<sup>+<\/sup> + H<sub>2<\/sub>O → RCOOH + NADH + H<sup>+<\/sup> <\/pre>\n\n<p><strong>Reaction 2<\/strong> (P<sub>i<\/sub> is inorganic <em>phosphate<\/em>). <\/p>\n\n<pre> RCOOH + P<sub>i<\/sub> → RC(=O)(O-P<sub>i<\/sub>) + H<sub>2<\/sub>O <\/pre>\n\n<p>The NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-linked oxidation of an aldehyde (reaction 1) is practically irreversible. That is, at equilibrium it has proceeded almost totally to the right. (As far as I am aware,\nthis reaction has never been convincingly reversed <em>in vitro<\/em>, although I know people who have tried!)  As stated above, the position of equilibrium of reaction 2 lies very much to the left.<\/p>\n\n<p>How can one 'drive' the formation of a phosphorylated carboxylic acid by coupling it to the (spontaneous) NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-linked oxidation of an aldehyde?<\/p>\n\n<p>A simplified version of the GAPDH reaction is as follows (a more complete mechanism, supported by a lot of experimental evidence, may be found in Fersht (1999), which I quote below).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1.<\/strong>  Formation on an enzyme-linked thiohemiacetal.<\/p>\n\n<pre> E-SH + RCHO → E-S-C(R)(H)(OH) <\/pre>\n\n<p>A sulphydryl on the enzyme (part of a Cys residue) reacts with the aldehyde group on the substrate to give a thiohemiacetal.  (In the representation above, groups in brackets are all connected to a single (tetrahedral) carbon atom). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2.<\/strong> The thiohemiacetal is oxidized by enzyme-bound NAD<sup>+<\/sup> to a thiol-ester (the key step).<\/p>\n\n<pre> E-S-C(R)(H)(OH) + NAD<sup>+<\/sup> → E-S-C(=O)(R) + NADH + H<sup>+<\/sup> <\/pre>\n\n<p>This (enzyme-bound) thiol-ester is a 'high energy' intermediate wherein, it may be envisaged, the free energy of aldehyde oxidation has been 'trapped'.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final step of the GAPDH reaction is now spontaneous (proceeds to the right).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3.<\/strong> Attack on the thiol-ester by inorganic phosphate <br/><br/>(P<sub>i<\/sub> is inorganic <em>phosphate<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<pre>E-S-C(=O)(R) + P<sub>i<\/sub> → E-SH + R-C(=O)(O-P<sub>i<\/sub>)<\/pre>\n\n<p>Thus, the free energy of NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-linked aldehyde oxidation has been 'sequestered' and used to 'drive' the thermodynamically unfavourable phosphorylation of a carboxylic acid, by coupling the two reactions via a ('high energy') thiol-ester.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 'thermodynamic price' is that the GAPDH reaction (unlike NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-linked aldehyde oxidation) is freely reversible. <\/p>\n\n<p>As stated above, this is a simplifed version of the GAPDH reaction.  The (tetrameric) enzyme contains a tightly bound NAD<sup>+<\/sup> for a start, and this needs to be taken account of.

In this case the reaction is almost irreversible in the direction of ATP synthesis! <\/p>\n\n<p>The standard transformed free energy (&Delta;G<sup>o'<\/sup>) for the hydrolysis of phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate and phosphate is ~ - 62 kJ/mol.

But perhaps the most important coupled reaction is that which occurs in <strong>oxidative phosphorylation<\/strong>, ie that which occurs beween oxidation of fuels via the respiratory redox chain and synthesis of ATP via the ATP synthetase complex. In short, that which occurs in <strong>respiration<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have 'steered clear' up to this point, as it is a very complex area and difficult to do justice to in a few lines.  However, in an attempt at completeness, I'll have a go.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation (due primarily to <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell.html\">Peter Mitchell<\/a>)  electron transport via the respiratory chain to molecular oxygen creates a proton  gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (which is normally impermeable to protons). Protons are pumped outwards. This proton gradient, or protonmotive force, may be used to 'drive' the following (thermodynamically unfavourable) reaction to the right, via the ATP synthetase complex.<\/p>\n\n<pre>ADP + Pi →  ATP<\/pre>\n\n<p>This is commonly referred to as 'ATP synthesis', but what is meant is that the above reaction is maintained far from equilibrium to the right. (And this reaction, being far from equilibrium, may be used, <em>by coupling<\/em>,  to 'drive' thermodynamically unfavourable processes).<\/p>\n\n<p>That is, electron transport to oxygen is <em>coupled<\/em> to 'ATP synthesis' via a proton gradient.  Among other characteristics, the coupled reactions in this case are <em>spatially separated<\/em>. (The ATP synthetase is an example of <strong>rotatory catalysis<\/strong>, see <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1997/walker-lecture.html\">here<\/a>).   <\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the two reactions <em>may be uncoupled<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p>A great example of an uncoupler is 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). This is a weakly acidic lipophilic compound where both the unionized (dinitrophenol) and ionized (dinitrophenolate) forms are membrane-permeable.  <\/p>\n\n<p>It may be envisaged that DNP shuttles protons across the membrane (thereby dissipating the proton gradient) by diffusing back and forth (through the membrane), picking up protons on the outside and depositing then on the inside.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Now electrons originating from foodstuffs are passed via the respiratory chain to oxygen but no ATP is synthesized: the reactions are <em>uncoupled<\/em>, and the free energy is dissipated as heat. In fact, DNP was at one time used as a slimming agent (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol\">here<\/a>), but (among other side effects) it also causes blindness. <\/p>\n\n<p>See Abeles, Frey &amp; Jencks (pp 620-621, quoted below), for a more thorough treatment of the mechanism of DNP.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the analogy of a car used by <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/115/nico\">nico<\/a>, this uncoupled reaction is equivalent to the case where the driver has his/her foot full on the accelerator (thus burning fuel at almost the maximum rate) but where the clutch is disengaged (thus no movement or 'work' is being done). To perhaps push the analogy a bit too far, a car moving along at, say,  50 KPH is an example of a coupled energy transformation: the burning of fuel is coupled to movement. <\/p>\n\n<p>Historically, of course, it was at one time thought that all ATP synthesis occured via substrate-level coupling.  <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell.html\">Peter Mitchell<\/a> changed all that.  <\/p>\n\n<p>These topics are treated in detail in almost every textbook of biochemistry.

Therefore, very minute quantities are sufficient to annihilate RNA experiments.

I can personally attest that you can precipitate it in pure alcohols and it will spontaneously refold as soon as it is rehydrated.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would not trust a simple detergent to get rid of it; you'll need something more volatile to be reliable.

This also means that in considering the grape, we have to estimate the concentration of all solutes, not just the one you used to make the (possibly) hypertonic solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll assume the sugar used was sucrose, which is the common table sugar.

Estimates of the sugar concentration in a grape are given in % w/w. Clearly grapes are denser than water (you can test this by putting a grape in water and seeing it sink). Therefore if you were to calculate in % w/v, you would find it to be more concentrated than a the same % w/w solution in water. Moreover, according to <a href=\"http://thepaleodiet.com/fruits-and-sugars/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site<\/a> grapes have a significant amount of glucose and fructose.

Thus, a major function of hepatic\n  urea synthesis is to effect this neutralization, without which the\n  body would otherwise be confronted by a major load of alkali.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Urea is excreted by the kidney, and is normally present in plasma and\n  body fluids at a concentration of 3.0\u20136.5 mmol/L.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia - Ornithine cycle<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gastrohep.com/ebooks/rodes.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Textbook of Hepatology<\/a> - <a href=\"http://www.gastrohep.com/ebooks/rodes/Rodes_2_3_7.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ammonia, urea production and pH regulation - Dieter Häussinger<\/a><\/li>\n<li>1984 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0968000484902937\" rel=\"nofollow\">The role of ureagenesis in pH homeostasis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The kidney reabsorbs urea in order to concentrate the urine:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ASPc1.jpg\" alt=\"nephron transports\"><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Figure 3 - nephron with material transports - urea resorption at the end of the urine creation process - <a href=\"http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/excretion/formation-composition-urine.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>About 40% of the urea filtered is normally found in the final\n  urine, since there is more reabsorption than secretion along the\n  nephron.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_urea_handling\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia - Renal urea handling<\/a>:<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2007 - <a href=\"http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/18/3/670.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Critical Role of Urea in the Urine-Concentrating Mechanism<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The kidney secretes the urea to the urine, but it absorbs more by the reabsorption than it secreted.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The kidney freely filters urea at the glomerulus, and then it both\n  reabsorbs and secretes it.

Nitrogen gas is ~75% of the earth's atmosphere and N<sub>2<\/sub> is the most chemically stable form of Nitrogen for conditions in the Earth's crust.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Nitrogen is one of the four most essential and universal elements to terrestrial life (Carbon Hydrogen and Oxygen being the others).  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nitrogen fixation<\/a>, the name given to the various processes which make chemically reactive forms of Nitrogen available to living things.

I think you will understand why this sentence makes no sense after reading what follows. I start with some background and then try to address directly what confuses you.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Short introduction to the concept of heritability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of heritability may have two meanings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Heritability is a concept defined at the <em>population level<\/em> for <em>one given trait<\/em>. The heritability ($h_B^2$) (in the broad sense) is the ratio of the genetic variance $V_p$ over the phenotypic variance $V_p$, where the phenotypic variance can itself be decomposed into environmental $V_e$ and genetic variance $V_g$ (and their covariance that we will neglect for the purpose of this question). <\/p>\n\n<p>$$h_B^2 = \\frac{V_{g}}{V_{p}} = \\frac{V_{g}}{V_{e} + V_{g}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>When saying environmental variance $V_e$, we don't refer to the total variance in the environment (such as the variance in temperature for example) but we refer to the phenotypic variance (in a given population of a given trait of interest) that is caused by environmental variance. The same logic is true for the genetic variance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Inheritence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>While the concept of heritability applies to phenotypic traits, the concept of inheritence can apply to DNA material. A mutation is inherited if the offspring receives the sequence from his/her mother or from his/her father (assuming we are talking about a species that have sexual reproduction with 2 genders).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Somatic versus germline mutations<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As pointed by @Chris in the comments. In multicellular organisms, not all mutations can be transmitted to the multicellular offspring. Most of the cells do not give rise to any other multicellular organisms. For example, imagine that while the biceps is under development at very low age, a mutation occurs that will be inherited by the daughter cells but not to the multicellular offspring. we call the line of cells that do not give rise to gametes (sperm and ovules), the soma line, by opposition to the germ line which gives rise to the gametes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As soon as a given locus (position on the DNA) has some variance and that this variance explains some phenotypic variance, then the phenotypic trait it influences has a heritability greater than zero. If the variance at this locus has no effect on the phenotype, then it's heritability is zero (because $V_g = 0$, although there is some variance in the actual sequence). If the phenotypic trait of interest does not show any variance (in the population considered), then the concept of heritability is undefined for this trait!<\/p>\n\n<p>I think you may have a confusion between \"inherited trait\" and \"heritable trait\". A mutation will necessarily be transmissible to the offspring (except if it happen to be in the somatic line in such case it will only be transmitted to daughter cells but not to the multicellular offspring) but it doesn't mean that this mutation will necessarily explain some variance in a phenotypic trait. A new much is necessarily heritable (pay attention to the soma vs germ line) but does not mean that a phenotypic will have higher heritability thanks to this mutation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23593,"question_id":23591,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1414698991},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1414751796,"creation_date":1414751796,"body":"<p><strong>Most mutations to the DNA are heritable, but not all are inherited.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Mutations occur in the DNA, DNA is then replicated and transmitted to offspring (cells or organisms). Generally all mutations are heritable because they can be inherited, but some aren't - either by random chance (drift) or deleterious fitness effects (selection). Any mutation which makes the cell less fit has a reduced chance of being inherited, but even mutations leading to cancer are inherited at some level (from mother cancer cell to daughter cancer cells) but at some point this lineage of inheritance will stop because it will kill the host (but this is no different to species/lineages of organism going extinct - if I carried a new novel mutation but didn't have children then that mutation is not inherited).<\/p>\n\n<p>*I suppose a mutation which stops DNA from being replicated could be classed as not-heritable because the DNA is not going to be replicated, but that depends on there being no other sources of replication machinery (other cells perhaps) - a process I don't know well enough to offer any firm conclusions on.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Non-heritable changes to the genome<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>DNA can be altered beyond just sequence mutation, for example methylation- but this can be used as a heritable change to the genome (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">genomic imprinting<\/a>).

Here, we investigate the influence of\n  stereoscopic depth on both neurophysiology and subjective experience.\n  Using multivariate statistical learning methods, we compare the brain\n  activity of subjects when freely watching the same movies in 2D and in\n  3D. Subjective reports indicate that 3D movies are more strongly\n  experienced than 2D movies. On the neural level, we observe\n  significantly higher intersubject correlations of cortical networks\n  when subjects are watching 3D movies relative to the same movies in\n  2D.

VRET in general was found to be more effective\n  than no treatment. No differences were found in effectiveness between\n  VRET using an HMD or CAVE. Results were maintained at 6 months\n  follow-up.

The following day, participants' brain activity was\n  monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they mentally\n  estimated distances in this environment. Results were compared with\n  that of participants performing the same task but having learned the\n  real version of the environment by actual walking.

I have not had any biology courses since highschool, but I was able to understand it well. It is really a book meant to teach. The style is beginner friendly, and not tedious/boring at all. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is an expensive buy and a very long read (I think the paper version is close to 2000 pages), but given the complexity of the subject matter, I find it reasonable. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you decide to go for it (or for any other neurobiology work, actually) get the newest edition. Getting an older one is a false economy here - our understanding of how this stuff works gets better by the year, and there is lots of missing (or sometimes even not-valid-any-longer) information in the older editions. <\/p>\n\n<h2>A few examples of what might make the book hard to understand for beginners<\/h2>\n\n<p>\"Principals of neural science\" does not require much preexisting biology knowledge. It is sufficient to roughly know that a cell has a nucleus, plasma with organelles swimming inside, and a membrane. But you have to be comfortable with a bit of biochemistry. This is an example passage concerning the behavior of ions in solution. I found this perfectly understandable with my prior knowledge, I don't know if you need brushing up on chemistry or not. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The cell membrane is selectively permeable to K+ because the otherwise impermeable membrane contains proteins that form pores called <em>ion channels<\/em>. The channels that are active when the cell is at rest are highly permeable to K+ but considerably less permeable to Na+. The K+ ions tend to leak out of these open channels, down the ion's concentration gradient. As K+ ions exit the cell, they leave behind a cloud of unneutralized negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane, so that the net charge inside the membrane is more negative than that outside. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And then there are examples like this one: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isoprenylation is another post-translational modification important for anchoring proteins to the cytosolic side of membranes. It occurs shortly after the synthesis of the protein is completed and involves a series of enzymatic steps that result in thioacylation by one of the two long-chain hydrophobic polyisoprenyl moieties (farnesyl, with 15 carbons, or geranyl-geranyl, with 20) of the dulfhydril group of a cysteine at the C-terminus of proteins. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, my own chemistry is bad enough that I could only understand that a protein is modified by attaching some molecular structure to it, and this makes it possible to attach the protein to the cell membrane. The lack of understanding of the details (what is a geranyl-geranyl?) did not stop me from understanding the rest of the section, so I don't mind, but I know that there are readers who'd have a problem with that. Sadly, I don't know of a source which does not require such knowledge, and if you feel the need to know every single word, you might need to use a reference while reading, or start with a course in biochemistry first before switching to the neurobiology. <\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you don't have a life science background, there might be words outside of the chemistry you might have to look up, or understand from context, but they will be unfamiliar at first. For example, I was surprised to see the word \"process\" used in the meaning of a physical protrusion from the cell body. But this is not such a high hurdle, you have to either read ahead and puzzle such words out, or use a dictionary. They are not so frequent to prevent comfortable reading. <\/p>\n","answer_id":23431,"question_id":23403,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1414692092},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":2,"post_id":23495,"edited":false,"creation_date":1414390998,"comment_id":36916,"body":"Can you please expand you answer?

Just to set some stuff straight: In contrast to a comment placed earlier, there is definitely a current flow between electrodes in neural tissue, as long as the impedance is not too high. The potential difference between the electrodes and impedance determines how much current flows, basically following Ohm's law: I = U/R.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to your hypothesis (A) - I confirm  WYSIWYG's answer - electrodes indeed do not have to be coated, as long as they are conductive. For instance, Ag/AgCl coatings are used to electrically stabilize the electrode, mainly for sensitive reference electrodes used for recording purposes (<a href=\"http://www.science-products.com/Products/CatalogG/AgAgCl-Pellets/ivm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">see a commercial link here<\/a>). For stimulation purposes chloride salts are a big no no, as AgCl or comparable chloride salts will be converted into metal (e.g. silver) + Cl<sub>2<\/sub>, obviously a toxic gas.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to your hypothesis (B) - It is the electrical field that activates neurons (<a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/11652216_New_currents_in_electrical_stimulation_of_excitable_tissues/file/79e4150cc73bab725f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Basser &amp; Roth 2000<\/a>) by means of inducing current flow. For example, imagine a cathode (negative electrode) placed close to a neuron. Normally in rest, a neuron's membrane is hyperpolarized (more negative ions inside the cell, the extracellular fluid can be considered to be neutral). The negative electrode will now cause the extracellular fluid to be negatively charged. Subsequently, positive current will flow out from the cell close to the electrode and into the electrode. According to Ohm's law, the membrane voltage is thus positive (note Ohm's law: U = IxR, with I being positive and R being always positive, means U is positive). Hence, the membrane is depolarized, as the resting state is a negatively charged state (hyperpolarized). With an anodic electrode neurons can also be depolarized but due to a slightly different mechanism. Basically, the flanking regions of the now negative current flow to the positive electrode become subject to positive current, as it counterbalances the negative flow to the electrode.

Its function is to transport chloride and other negatively charged ion like thiocyanate ions from the inside of the cell to the outside (into the extra cellular space). This happens along a gradient, meaning the ions flow from the place of high concentration (inside the cell) to the place of low concentration (outside the cell). Since this would mean that a negative charge would build up on the outside of the cell, positively charged sodium ions follow the chloride ions by passive diffusion. This ions are secreted into the mucus in the extra cellular space.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads to a higher concentrations of electrolytes (salts) outside of the cell, which causes water to leave the cell (following the higher concentration of electrolytes), which makes the mucus thinner. <\/p>\n\n<p>When the CFTR gene is mutated, this function is impaired and ions cannot be transported across the membrane. This causes a higher electrolyte concentration inside the cell and water stays there. This causes the mucus to get thicker (due to less influx of water), which then can block fine channels of the lung. Additionally bacteria can grow in the thicker mucus, which can cause severe problems as pneumonia. The process functions as shown in the figure below (from <a href=\"https://www.bio.logis.de/pgs/produktnutzen/carrier-status\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>), the sodium ions are not shown here:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0WJib.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to read further about cystic fibrosis, I recommend this <a href=\"http://cyfbin.weebly.com/cyfb.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the immune system there are different functions affected. First, the reduced (or prevented) secretion if thiocyanate ions lead to a reduction in the production of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothiocyanite#Relation_to_cystic_fibrosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hypothiocyanite<\/a> ions which kill bacteria. Then different cells which are of importance to a proper immune reaction are impaired in their function, as shown in the figure below (from the first reference):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Vz2Q.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The function of CFTR is impaired in all cell types, not only in epithelial cells in the lung (although these are the most obvious consequences). In the cells of the immune system (T-cells for example) the intracellular ion concentration is disturbed including Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> which plays an important role in the regulation of other genes.

The Cl- ions follow the Na+ ions with passive transport to even up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge\" rel=\"nofollow\">electric charges<\/a>, while the water will follow the higher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration\" rel=\"nofollow\">osmolarity<\/a> created by both ions. (Something similar happens with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose\" rel=\"nofollow\">glucose<\/a> when you put grapes into water. The glucose cannot go through the membrane of grape cells, but the water can. So the higher osmolarity in the grape cells will suck in water and the grapes will crack.)  <\/p>\n\n<p>Without working CFTR the cells cannot transport too many Na+ ions, because their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">membrane potential<\/a> changes too much when the Cl- ions cannot even up the charges, and so the cells would possibly die because of this. (Another possible explanation that the energy barrier would be too much for the Na+ transporter to send through another Na+ ion.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Without sufficient ion transport the water transport is not adequate in many regions of the body.

In many cases the pancreas is completely cystic, and it loses the ability to produce insulin, which leads to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis-related_diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">diabetes<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The reproductive organs are affected as well, most of the males with cystic fibrosis are infertile, and about every fifth female as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>As you already know this is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.

If it makes a difference, I'm mostly interested in the Common raven, <em>Corvus corax<\/em>. Are there for instance any information on long-distance dispersal (wind-blown individuals over sea?) that can be used to roughly estimate this? Information on other corvid species could also be interesting, as a rough proxy.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are wondering, my motivation for asking is the biblical story in Genesis 6&ndash;8 (the deluge of Noah). Here, Noah sends out a raven and a dove to look for land. From the story it appears as if the raven can stay airborne for a longer time than the dove, which returns to the ark to rest. Is there any realism in the claim that a raven can stay airborne for one or maybe even two weeks?<\/p>\n\n<p>Some background from Genesis 8 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Torah_and_Nach\" rel=\"nofollow\">this translation<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After forty days, Noah opened the window he had made in the ark. He sent out the raven, and it departed. It went back and forth until the water had dried up from the land's surface. He then sent out the dove to see if the water had subsided from the land's surface. The dove could not find any place to rest its feet, and it returned to him, to the ark. There was still water over all the earth's surface. [Noah] stretched out his hand, and brought it to him in the ark. He waited another seven days, and once again sent the dove out from the ark. The dove returned to him toward evening, and there was a freshly-plucked olive leaf in its beak. Noah then knew that the water had subsided from the earth. He waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove [again]. This time it did not return to him any more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So the raven couldn't find a place to land, and it flew around until it could do so. A week later, the dove still couldn't find a place to land, but a week later it could. Thus, either (a)&nbsp;the raven was flying around for more than a week (as much as two weeks) or (b)&nbsp;the raven could more readily land in a wet area than the dove.

The reticular formation as mentioned by others before me is crucial, as the thalamus is the gateway of information to and from the brain. Therefore, subcortical structures such as the thalamus, when 'shut down', induce unconsciousness. Mircea Steriade <a href=\"http://m.brodmannarea.info/readings/steriade-rtn-2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(2005)<\/a> has an excellent review on this and he is a leader in the field the field of sleep and absence epilepsy, thalamo-cortical interactions and consciousness. He describes there the cortical responses seen in the EEG during sleep: the sleep spindles, or related spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) seen in the EEG during absence epileptic seizures, where patients temporarily loose consciousness. Sleep spindles and SWDs are highly synchronized responses that basically block out sensory input and cortical output. The blocking of sensory input and blocking of output to the body may be regarded as a loss of consciousness, as one is not able to sense the environment or undertake action in response to environmental stimuli (e.g., <a href=\"http://nucleus.med.upatras.gr/NU/images/stories/physiology/articles/K_2000_CNP.pdf)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kostopoulus (2000)<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, since the question is what part of the brain needs to shut down, it is technically the neocortex, as the neocortex holds the key to being aware of one's surroundings, i.e., processing of sensory input as well as driving motor neurons to move, talk and respond to stimuli <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex\" rel=\"nofollow\">(see wiki page on neocortex)<\/a>. So the end organ mainly associated with consciousness is the neocortex - as described in a review paper by Nobel laureate sir Francis Crick <a href=\"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/40352/1/148.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1990)<\/a>. The authors also indicate the thalamus and other structures as possible sites involved, but principally it is the neocortex.

This lobe receives the sensory information from all over the body and responds to it when body is active.

GABAergic inhibition of the thalamus, most likely deriving from the NRT is probably a part of the reason that sensory stimuli doesn't penetrate during sleep.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is also influenced by release of hormones in the body whose level when rises in the blood causes certain changes in the concentration at some regions such as receptors which gets blocked temporarily and stops signaling the brain.

I found some articles about the temperature dependency of alcoholic fermentation:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Juices fermented at 10°C exhibited ethanol concentrations between 7.4\n  and 13.4% and populations of K. apiculata, C. stellata and C. krusei\n  in the range 106-108 cells/ml.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1988 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1988.tb04312.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">The effects of temperature and pH on the growth of yeast species during the fermentation of grape juice<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At low temperatures, alcohol yield was higher.

Just the same as the previous answer. I think the main fermentation products will be always ethanol in the yeasts chosen for alcoholic fermentation (if the other conditions are right), so it is not temperature dependent in this case. A growing yeast will produce alcohol on both low and high temperatures. The ratio of ethanol and the byproducts can depend on the temperature, but not the presence of the ethanol itself. By too low or too high temperature the yeast will die or will stop to grow. (My experience that CO2 production is faster by high temperature, so it is because everything is faster or because the ethanol/CO2 ratio is lower.) An example of temperature dependence by wine making:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Temperature control is vital in the production of fine table wines as:<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>High temperatures encourage the loss of alcohol and aroma and flavour compounds due to volatilisation. If the temperature goes above\n  30 -35ºC, the yeast becomes sluggish and fermentation may stop.<\/li>\n  <li>Low temperatures will lead to a poor extraction of colour and tannins in red wines and can also cause sluggish fermentations and the\n  production of high levels of ethyl acetate.<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wineskills.co.uk/winemaking/winemaking-knowledge-base/managing-alcoholic-fermentation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Managing the alcoholic fermentation<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I think \"sluggish\" means stop growing in this case, and ofc. stop fermenting due to the death of the yeast cells.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":23540,"question_id":21710,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1414501681}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21710/why-would-yeast-grow-but-not-produce-alcohol","last_activity_date":1414501681,"creation_date":1411862867,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why would yeast grow but not produce alcohol?","body":"<p>I'm studying for my intro to microbiology test and I have a question asking why a culture of yeast responsible for producing alcohol would be growing, but not producing alcohol?<\/p>\n\n<p>The multiple choice answers are:\na) the maltose is toxic\nb) O2 is in the medium\nc) Not enough protein is available in the agar\nd) The temperature is too low\ne) The temperature is too high<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: There is not much more context that what I gave here.

These spread by diffusion across the cell body. At the axon hillock, the point where the axon starts, all of these changes collect and sum up to a net change. If this crosses a certain threshold, the axon hillock generates a so-called action potential, i.e. an electrical impulse. This impulse then travels down the axon until it reaches the terminals. Terminals attach to other neurons (or e.g. muscle cells) via synapses. When an action potential reaches a terminal, the impulse will be carried across the synapse and cause a specific effect on the next cell.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, there is a clear single-direction signal transfer here: Input -> Cell body -> Axon -> Output. The cell that receives the output can't \"fire back\" in any way because it receives that signal as an input itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>A diagram of a pathway including several neurons might thus look like this (neurons are drawn as yellow cell bodies and arrows to indicate where their axons reach):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4sOKl.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>(Taken from Hubel, D: Eye, Brain and Vision, <a href=\"http://hubel.med.harvard.edu/book/b6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hubel.med.harvard.edu/book/b6.htm<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>This does get a bit more complicated when you consider <em>nerves<\/em> rather than individual neurons.

However, you are not getting contagious unless you show symptoms. This is different in other diseases like chicken pox or measles where you spread the virus before showing symptoms.

This is most likely one of the main reasons for the wide spreading of the disease.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Same problem as in 1.

The advantage of the first world is that we have functional health care systems. They allow better care for the persons and also better isolation of contact persons. I think it is unlikely that it would spread widely. The perspective will be different, if the virus makes the jump into the densely populated regions in South-East Asia. There a lot of people live closely together, this can cause real problems. Fortunately for us the virus is not highly contagious.

Ebola is infecting cells of the immune system (mostly macrophages and dendritic cells) which are located in the skin which makes the route through the respiratory organs pretty uneffecient, but it is possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there are reports for Ebola transmissions (or at least unclear cases in which a direct contact could be excluded), which suggest that the aerosl transmission is possible. There are reports of Ebola infections which spread among experimental animals between infected and non-infected (and without direct contact) control groups. This has been observed between rhesus monkeys and pigs. It was also possible for the pigs to infect non-human primates (see references 1-4 for details). <\/p>\n\n<p>This results should be seen with some caution: At least for pigs an Ebola infection seems to be pretty much different than one in humans. There it looks more like a respiratory disease with all what comes along with it: Extended sneezing and coughing - which makes a lot of aerosol droplets. See reference 3 for the original paper and 5 and 6 for a summary and a classification. I think it is also possible that anatomical differences to the humans make such an infection route easier or harder.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally there are some reports of infected people which had no direct contact to people (see reference 7). However, this is rare and mostly restricted to people which where involved in health care for infected persons. These people come in close contact to the infected people which raises their chance of getting infected by aerosols. This underlines the importance for health care workers to get the right protective equipment.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673695928413\">Transmission of Ebola virus (Zaire strain) to uninfected control\nmonkeys in a biocontainment laboratory.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/2/200.long\">Replication, Pathogenicity, Shedding, and Transmission of Zaire\nebolavirus in Pigs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121115/srep00811/full/srep00811.html\">Transmission of Ebola virus from pigs to non-human primates<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457911001225\">Aerosol exposure to Zaire ebolavirus in three nonhuman primate\nspecies: differences in disease course and clinical pathology<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2012/11/19/pig-to-monkey-ebola-is-there-something-in-the-air/\">Pig-to-monkey Ebola: is there something in the air?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2014/08/08/new-paper-on-ebola-no-primate-to-primate-transmission-seen/\">New paper on Ebola\u2013no primate-to-primate transmission seen<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S92.long\">Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\n1995: Risk Factors for Patients without a Reported Exposure<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":23426,"question_id":23424,"up_vote_count":15,"last_edit_date":1414150440},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlp4Q.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5198,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5198/anongoodnurse","reputation":12148,"display_name":"anongoodnurse"},"score":0,"post_id":23484,"edited":false,"creation_date":1414296859,"comment_id":36864,"body":"Thinking that ebola can evolve to become airborne is kind of like thinking horses can evolve to fly.

The virulence\n  and infectious dose of this variant of ZEBOV are unknown in humans;\n  wild-type virus has a case-fatality rate of up to 90% (3).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The person had been following standard procedure, holding the mice\n  while injecting them intraperitoneally with an immune globulin\n  preparation. While the person was injecting the fifth mouse with a\n  hypodermic syringe that had been used on previous mice, the animal\n  kicked the syringe, causing the needle to pierce the person\u2019s\n  left-hand gloves, resulting in a small laceration. The virologist\n  immediately squeezed the site to force the extravasation of blood.\n  After decontamination of the blue suit in the chemical shower, the\n  injured site was irrigated with 1 liter of sterile water and then\n  scrubbed with povidone-iodine for 10 minutes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>In terms of exposure risk, the needle was presumed to be contaminated\n  with virus-laden blood, although it was suspected that low levels of\n  virus were present on the needle. The animals had not yet manifested\n  signs of infection, and much contamination may have been removed\n  mechanically when the needle pierced the gloves. The local\n  decontamination of the site also reduced potential for infection.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>USAMRIID medical, scientific, and executive staff concluded that the\n  person with potential exposure warranted quarantine in the MCS.\n  Contact plus airborne precautions (gown, gloves, N95 mask, eye\n  protection) were used, with a plan to upgrade to BSL-4 precautions for\n  signs or symptoms of illness. These extra precautions were instituted\n  while the patient was asymptomatic for several reasons: 1) the timing\n  of initial clinical manifestations with regard to potential for\n  shedding virus were not known for this specific isolate in human\n  infection; 2) there was interest in ensuring all infection control\n  procedures were being followed appropriately in advance of clinical\n  illness; and 3) there was interest in reducing any potential\n  confounders, such as a caregiver transmitting a febrile respiratory\n  infection to the patient, which might lead to unnecessary procedures\n  or additional isolation. The person was monitored for routine vital\n  signs; daily laboratory studies (coagulation studies, blood counts,\n  chemistries, viral isolation, D-dimer) and regular physician\n  assessments were performed.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Over the next several days, discussions were held with several\n  internationally recognized filovirus experts regarding potential\n  treatments or postexposure prophylaxis options. Local and state public\n  health officials were also notified. The consensus opinion was that\n  there was no safe, readily available source of immune plasma and\n  little evidence existed to support its use. Emergency investigational\n  new drug (IND) protocols were established for treatment with\n  recombinant nematode protein (rNAPc2) and antisense oligomers, with\n  the intention to consider implementation only if the patient\n  demonstrated evidence of infection.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Ultimately, none of the 5 mice had confirmed viremia at the time of\n  the incident.

Thinning refers to the removal of a branch or shoot all the way back to the node which it originated from. This is the primary type of pruning used on trees - either to limit growth or to increase the amount of light permeating to lower branches. Late winter is generally the best time to do this, just before the tree breaks dormancy, since plant pathogens are generally less abundant. By pruning in late winter, this also reduces the amount of time that the wound is exposed before the tree begins active growth. <\/p>\n\n<p>In contrast, \"heading\" refers to the partial removal of a branch, usually 1/2 to 1/3 back to the node.  The purpose of heading is to stimulate shoot growth on the remaining branch - hedges being a primary example. Because new shoots and leaves are desired, heading is usually performed at the height of stem growth (in most climates late spring to early summer). <\/p>\n\n<p>The biologic processes behind this are complex (botanists are just beginning to understand how plant behavior adapts to predation) but in very general terms, plants respond to damage in two ways: by compartmentalizing the wound; and by stimulating growth on the remaining tissue. Many types of woody plants produce latent (or adventitious) buds, which lie dormant within the cambium tissue. Normally these buds are suppressed by auxin hormones produced in the meristem by active shoots.

Removal of these\n  intracellular inclusions seems to occur within the open circulation\n  where the RBC are also checked for their loss of deformability to\n  check for age. To achieve this, RBC must pass through the endothelial\n  slits of the sinus to reenter the blood circulation. During this\n  course, cells that are non-deformable will be removed from the\n  circulation by residential macrophages. In the mean-time all inclusion\n  bodies are also being removed. In splenectomized patients or in\n  patients with a non-functional spleen, phagocytosis of the inclusion\n  bodies fails and results in a retention of a variety of intracellular\n  inclusions within the RBC, such as Howell-jolly bodies (inclusions of\n  nuclear chromatin remnants) (Wilkins and Wright, 2000), Heinz bodies\n  (inclusions of denatured hemoglobin caused by oxidative damage)\n  (Wilkins and Wright, 2000) siderocytes (RBC containing granules of\n  iron that are not part of the cell's hemoglobin) (Wilkins and Wright,\n  2000) and Pappenheimer bodies inclusion bodies formed by phagosomes\n  that have been engulfing excessive amounts of iron (Wilkins and\n  Wright, 2000).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The molecular mechanism that underlies the removal of inclusion bodies\n  is largely unknown. In Willekens et al. (2003) presented an analogy to\n  the removal of Heinz bodies when discussing RBC that lose hemoglobin\n  through vesiculation. Via the process of RBC vesiculation the RBC\n  loses aggregated hemoglobin, which is important to maintain the\n  homeostasis of RBC, increases in density and becomes smaller (Piomelli\n  and Seaman, 1993). It was suggested that this process is also\n  facilitated by the macrophages of the spleen, in which older cells\n  vesiculate more than younger ones. Clearly, macrophages play a pivotal\n  role in the clearance of damaged content from circulating RBC (Crosby,\n  1957; Willekens et al., 2003) and vesiculation is an interesting and\n  plausible mechanism to explain the efficient removal of damaged\n  content while leaving the RBC intact (Wilson et al., 1987).

Once the telomeres get short enough they act as a signal that triggers apoptosis, destroying the cell. There is some human-to-human variation in the initial length of the telomeres, but the impression I've gotten from hanging around cell biologists is that the division limit is somewhere on the order of 10-100.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also cells in which the activity of a protein called telomerase is upregulated. Telomerase is a type of polymerase (an enzyme that synthesizes DNA) that acts to add extra length to telomeres. Telomerase+ cells are not affected by the division limit in the normal way. Some examples of telomerase+ cells are stem cells and many kinds of cancer cells. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Stationary cells<\/h2>\n\n<p>In a very real sense, a cell \"dies\" when it divides. Upon division a cell splits into two daughter cells, but it cannot be said that either daughter cell \"is\" the original cell. So a more satisfying way to answer to the original question would be to look at how long a single cell can be kept as-is and recognizably alive (i.e. in stationary phase).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you cheat and freeze the cell at liquid nitrogen temperatures (78 K), then there are plenty of examples of cells surviving for decades, in the sense that a culture can be stored and then thawed, and normal life processes will resume at least some of the time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sadly, there may not be a proper answer out there to this version of the question. A quick lit search did not turn up much.

It is important to understand that those who criticize the gene centric view in this article are NOT saying that selection do not act on genes neither that selfish genetic elements do not exist (thinks that R. Dawkins talk about in his books). They totally agree with those things. They just argue that the fisherian view of evolution in not enough and that according to recent findings we may want to rename our theory. The \"no, all is well\" opinion totally agrees with the importance of these new insights that do not come from what one may call the gene-centric view of evolution but they just don't think it is worth renaming the theory for that because our knowledge in evolution is just growing as it has always been growing and it doesn't seem that we are currently living a revolution in our understanding of evolution. I think that the main revolutions that happen to occur in evolution these days mostly have to do with the methodology of testing rather than with the theory itself.

Shearing during pipetting  is certainly a legitimate concern in cell culture. You will notice its negative effect on viability most explicitly when pipetting cells in freezing\n medium (containing DMSO) following a thaw. Until their DMSO concentration drops their membranes are weaker &amp; more fluid. That's why you pipette the frozen cells drop-wise to the fresh medium, to be especially gentle at this point.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prokaryotic cells such as the above mentioned TOP10 cells are treated with Calcium chloride and glycerol which has essentially the same effect on their walls and membranes. Hence pipetting should be delicately performed after thawing these cells as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>With that being said, if you compare the sensitivity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to shearing, eukaryotic cells are profoundly more sensitive.<\/p>\n\n<p>For individuals using competent bacteria for sub-cloning and other routine uses, killing a small percentage of of your cells is not that important. However if you are using the transformation to generate cDNA libraries it's very important that you have a titer sufficiently representing the transcriptome the library is composed of. <\/p>\n\n<p>In these instances using a more premium competent cell, adhering to correct temperatures and minimizing pipetting is essential. This is why many are taught to swirl the DNA the with the competent cells, rather than the harsher alternative: pipetting up-and-down.<\/p>\n\n<p>The four most important factors that contribute to cellular shearing are, and in order form most to least contributory:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Diameter of the bore in the pipette tip, the smaller the more shearing. <\/li>\n<li>Speed at which the suspension is passing through the opening of the tip. The faster the more damaging.  <\/li>\n<li>Size and rigidity of the cell. Larger cells are more prone to damage.  Cells with a murein wall are less prone to damage.  <\/li>\n<li>Concentration of cells. Cultures that are more concentrated are more prone to damage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Because the make up if the cell itself is so influential on the amount of damage, and because of the enormous variety of cells; designing a representative experiment to assess damage would be very difficult and  laborious.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally,  the variety of tips and seriologicals is also enormous. However if one were to attempt to assess this it could be done:<\/p>\n\n<p>Choose a representative variety of cell lines, choose a representative variety of pipettes. One would probably want to use a robotic pipette to be able to  evaluate incrementally assigned speeds and pressures. Look at different culture concentrations,  phases of the growth curve, time between pipetting and analysis, distance between the exiting fluid and the culture etc, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think a very successful analysis method would be using propidium iodide and FACS.<\/p>\n\n<p>After your experiment which will cost a lot of time and $, I think you will find common sense rules: keep pipetting to a minimum and use wider tips whenever possible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20890,"question_id":2602,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1413898447},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user1357"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user1357"},"score":1,"post_id":20903,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyg92.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6061,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6061/rhill45","reputation":2493,"display_name":"rhill45","accept_rate":79},"edited":false,"creation_date":1409613673,"comment_id":32701,"body":"@rhill45 yeah the question was about cell shear stress damage during pipetting..the other answered seemed to buy into the only damage coming from the pal tip..but i wanted to point out that the shear stress from the pipetted liquid is equally likely to damage/destroy the cell."},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user1357"},"score":1,"post_id":20903,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kyg92.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6061,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6061/rhill45","reputation":2493,"display_name":"rhill45","accept_rate":79},"edited":false,"creation_date":1409615012,"comment_id":32705,"body":"@rhill45 also if your going to learn php you should invest time in asp because many industries see saw between the two."}],"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1409613929,"creation_date":1409454465,"body":"<p>This question would be better served in the physics se or chemistry.

Pipetting embryos is necessary for many protocols, from in vitro fertilization to collecting embryos prior to analyzing gene expression by microarrays. We sought to determine if pipetting upregulates phosphorylated MAPK8/9 (formerly known as stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase/SAPK/JNK1, 2). We found that phosphorylated MAPK8/9, a marker of MAPK8/9 activation, is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner by pipetting. Whereas embryos with the zona pellucida removed were more sensitive to stress-induced lethality mediated by 1.2 dynes/cm(2) shear force, phosphorylated MAPK8/9 was induced at lower numbers of pipet triturations in hatched embryos at E4.5. E4.5 embryos were more sensitive to induction of MAPK8/9 than unhatched embryos at E2.5 or E3.5. E3.5 embryos also showed a pipetting dose-dependent induction of FOS protein (formerly known as c-fos), a marker of shear stress in many cell types. Phosphorylated MAPK8/9 measured in ex vivo embryos from E1.5 to E4.5 were expressed at low levels. Embryos that had been pipetted sufficiently to induce phosphorylated MAPK8/9 and FOS had the same number of cells as untreated embryos 24 hr later. This suggests that rapid phosphorylation of MAPK8/9 due to transient shear stress does not mediate long-term negative biological outcomes. But, it is possible that techniques requiring multiple handling events would induce MAPK8/9 and cause biological outcomes or that other biological outcomes are affected by low amounts of transient shear stress. This study suggests that embryo handling prior to experimental measurement of signal transduction phosphoproteins, proteins and mRNA should be performed with care. Indeed, it is likely that shear stress may cause rapid transient changes in hundreds of proteins and mRNA.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":20903,"question_id":2602,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1409613929},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1414028967,"creation_date":1414028967,"body":"<p>Shear stress $\\tau$ in this small sizes is usually measured in dyne/cm2 or N/m2 = Pa.

As a basic definition, you can say that in natural selection, selection is done on fitness (overall, long-term success of reproduction) and is determined by the complete living environment of the species. In artificial selection, selection is done by humans on a plant or animal species for specific attributes that are desired (see any Evolutionary textbook for more on the difference). So the two processes generally try to optimize completely different things, and artificial selection has a goal which is not the case for natural selection. <\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, <strong>Eugenics<\/strong> can be likened to artificial selection, done by humans on humans. The methods used (selective breeding, culling, trunkated selection, sterilization etc.) are potentially the same. The difference between eugenics and articifial selection on plants and animals other than humans is purely moral and political (and therefore off-topic for Bio-SE).<\/p>\n\n<p>However, eugenics has also often been misguided in practice (if you ignore for a moment the usually horrible morals behind it). First, it relies on desired and undesired genotypes and phenotypes. Most people would not regard these as valid concepts, and even so, what will be desired/undesired will clearly differ between societies and over time. Second, eugenics does not appreciate the value of genetic diversity for the long-term success of a population (it will rather result in lower diversity). Third, eugenics is usually aimed for obvious physical traits and diseases, without much regard for their genetic background (e.g. heterozygious recessive carriers of disease). Fourth, eugenics usually devolve into a hunt for \"weaker\" groups of people, even if this has nothing to do with the gene pool of the population (for instance, many birth defects and the prevalence of Down's syndrome has almost nothing to do with the genetics of the population).<\/p>\n\n<p>I guess you could argue that ongoing selection in humans is a form of eugenics since it is to a large extent determined by human interactions and choices (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8044.abstract?etoc\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Courtiol et al. 2012.

J Sex Res. 41(1):27-42\">Geary et al. 2004<\/a>). However, this is definitely not a standard definition, and big difference compared to \"normal\" eugenics is that it is not guided by a common and explicit goal.

In it, water acts as a nucleophile in conjunction with the aspartic acid residue to hydrolyze the peptide bond in the protein's target. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Aspartyl_protease_mechanism.png/800px-Aspartyl_protease_mechanism.png\" alt=\"Aspartyl protease mechanism of action\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sup><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aspartyl_protease_mechanism.png\">WikiMedia: Aspartyl protease mechanism.png<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>A number of HIV-1 proteins are synthesized as polyproteins, and protease is required to cleave them in the appropriate spot(s) so they can assume their mature forms. This is a very big deal, because without these cleavage events HIV-1 cannot complete its replication cycle, and so becomes non-infectious.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/HIV-replication-cycle.svg/700px-HIV-replication-cycle.svg.png\" alt=\"HIV replication cycle\"><\/p>\n\n<p><sup><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HIV-replication-cycle.svg\">WikiMedia: HIV-replication-cycle.svg<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>Protease inhibitors act by \"sticking\" in the binding cleft, obscuring the aspartate and preventing binding of the target proteins. However, these small-molecule inhibitors are very specific to HIV-1 and the amino acid residues that compose the binding cleft, otherwise they could potentially inhibit one or more of the many aspartyl proteases our body makes naturally. While it is not very likely that a destructive mutation in the Asp-Thr-Gly motif would result in a replication-competent virus, other more conservative mutations may occur in the binding cleft that still allow the target to bind and be cleaved. However, depending on the exact protease inhibitor being used, a single mutation, even if it's conservative, may still be enough to dramatically decrease the inhibitor's binding efficiency and allow protease to maintain some or all of its functional capacity. This is why cocktails of inhibitors are used: they each depend on different amino acids for their binding, so if mutations arise at some point that do affect the activity of one inhibitor, others may still be unaffected. Evolutionarily-speaking, the inhibitors put a tremendous selection pressure on the virus, which combined with HIV-1's naturally \"sloppy\" replication process, leads to mutants appearing in relatively short periods of time.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two kinds of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope\">epitopes<\/a> in the adaptive immune system: those recognized by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody\">antibodies<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell\">B cells<\/a>, and those recognized by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell\">T cells<\/a> when presented in the context of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex\">MHC<\/a>. Antibody epitopes are generally found on the surface of a pathogen or a pathogen-infected cell (when speaking in the context of infectious diseases), as proteins or other compounds capable of raising an immune response that are only located completely inside of the pathogen or infected cell are not available for binding. T cell epitopes, on the other hand, are linear peptide fragments (and sometimes other molecules, like glycolipids) generated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#Antigen_processing_and_presentation\">internal processing<\/a> in the antigen-presenting cell, and are usually pretty representative of the complete contents of the cell, native and foreign. Native epitopes generally don't produce immune responses - when they do, autoimmunity occurs. Foreign epitopes are recognized by circulating T cells, and help prime an immune response against the infected cells. (As a side note, since HIV-1 infects a subset of T cells, it is a way for them to escape immune detection). Mutations in the protease protein may affect some of the epitopes it produces, but those mutations are just as likely to increase visibility to the immune system as decrease it, so overall there's no net gain or loss.<\/p>\n","answer_id":23356,"question_id":23353,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1413951476,"creation_date":1413951476,"body":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_HIV-protease_inhibitors\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HIV protease inhibitors are peptide-like chemicals that competitively\n  inhibit the action of the virus aspartyl protease.
