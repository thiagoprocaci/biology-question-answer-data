For example in more than 50% of tumors, p53 is mutated. p53 among other things regulates mitosis and forces the cell to arrest in a specific growth state if other systems detected a mutation in the DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>But in your special case we have to look at major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) and NLRC5. There are two types of MHC, namely MHC class I and class II. MHC II presents mostly bacterial peptides to CD4+ T cells causing a immune response. However, MHC I presents viral peptides and peptides from your own body. These peptides are detected by CD8+ T cells which are cytotoxic T cells initializing apoptosis. Without these own peptides natural killer (NK) cells are activated because of a missing-self signal causing apoptosis, too.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pL39.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pL39.png\" alt=\"Watson et al., Int.J.Cancer 2006; Research on MHC I expression and survival of patients. High and absent MHC I expression have a higher survival rate than low MHC I expression\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Watson et al. (figure 1, Watson et al., Int.J.Cancer, 2006) showed that patients with high MHC I expression or an absent MHC I expression have a higher survival than patients with low MHC I expression. If patients express high levels of MHC I, the chance that these proteins present cancer peptides is higher than patients expressing low levels of MHC I and therefore cancerous cells get killed by cytotoxic T cells probably more often. Without MHC class I, NK cells will initiate apoptosis and cancerous cells will die, too. Patients with low MHC class I expression won´t present so much peptides to cytotoxic T cells and therefore less cancer peptides are presented. But as they have MHC I, NK cells keep inactive. So the cancer finds an escape mechanism in tricking the immune system.<\/p>\n\n<p>NLRC5 is the biggest member of the NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Expression of NLRC5 can be enhanced by IFN-gamma which activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. STAT 1 enhances the expression of NLRC5 and NLRC5 itself can build an enhanceosome with RFX. This enhanceosome raises the expression of MHC class I! NLRC5 is often mutated for example in colorectal cancer. Research now has to focus on how to enhance NLRC5 and therefore MHC class I expression in different cancer types and out of these results to develop an efficient cancer treatment.<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope that I could help you.

Here I am especially referring to phenomena that are symmetric on the micro and asymmetric on the macro level. Let me give an examples from physics:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arrow of time<\/a>: Physical processes at the micro level are\n  completely time-symmetric, if you reversed time, all laws would remain\n  the same. Yet on a macro level they are not time-symmetric, we have an\n  obvious direction (flow) of time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that we have a similar situation with evolution:<\/p>\n\n<p>On the micro level it is really only about adaption (and not about improvement): You put some beings into an environment and they adapt, you change this environment and they adapt. No improvement, just blind \"back and forth\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Yet looking at the whole tree of life on the macro level we have a different picture, we see all kinds of emergent phenomena:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>explosion in <em>diversity<\/em><\/li>\n<li>emergence of complex interconnected <em>ecosystems<\/em> with completely new dynamics of their own<\/li>\n<li>true <em>innovations<\/em> in functionality (sensors, actuators, information processing etc.)<\/li>\n<li>and finally of course higher order functions like abstract <em>intelligence<\/em> (and  even <em>qualia<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>To make the difference more concrete I will give a <em>gedankenexperiment<\/em> of two planet simulators. In both cases you accelerate time so that one hour translates into one billion years. Both simulators function differently in a subtle way but you don't know how. You throw some simple sims onto both planets and let the evolution simulation run. You don't switch your computer off and go to bed, the next morning you decelerate time and take a look:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Planet 1: The simple sims quickly adapted to the environment as expected (but they stayed simple because evolution is not about improvement but about adaption).<\/li>\n<li>Planet 2: Some strange looking sims wish you a good morning and want to discuss the technicalities of the Riemann hypothesis with you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>My question<\/strong><br>\nWhat are the <em>minimal conditions<\/em> that have to be met to get this kind of bootstrapping (symmetry breaking from micro to macro level) started.

To give an example of a possible answer it could be something like Parrondo's paradox, a fascinating phenomenon from game theory where you combine two symmetric (losing) processes to get a (winning) asymmetric process.

Toungue rolling is an often mentioned example.  <a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/02/dawkins-darwin-drift-and-neutral-theory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some folks argue that there is only adaptive changes and phenotype, others like Gould and Lewontin argue that some traits can be the result of pleiotropy<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So first of all this sort of discussion can tell us that the question is argued both ways in a convincing enough way that it is not resolved in biology - some argue quite confidently that all traits are selected for and things like flagellar motors and upright ambulation and eyeballs evolve because of and experiencing constant evolutionary pressure.  Others argue that these genes that produce these things are doing something else useful while they are becoming these later more useful traits. <\/p>\n\n<p>The common twist here is <a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/186/3/767.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">plieotropy<\/a>.  That the genes that are producing the phenotype one is observing is also participating in one or more other biological traits that may is being positively selected for.  <\/p>\n\n<p>A more interesting example of how this works is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox\" rel=\"nofollow\">the domesticated silver fox experiment<\/a>. Foxes which have had domestication bred into them (just to show that it can be done by selection) lose their red color and their ears are softer and fuzzier.  Nobody tried to select for these traits, but they come associated with each fox that is domesticated.  Are these traits plieotropic or only very tightly linked?  So far they have not been exhibited separately.  In any case I think its fair to say that the experiment didn't care about the color of the fox - only its meekness towards people.  These traits come along for the ride. <\/p>\n\n<p>So it might be with any other desirable genetic trait.  If a gene becomes closer to producing a lung from a gill, if that gene is sticking around it must be because there is positive selection for that trait, even if the lung like gill is not particularly useful for that fish. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry but I actually disagree that it is obvious that non-useful steps must be had for any such complicated trait.  If that were true then you would have a point, but not every biologist would give that to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>It might be a bit surprising that such discussions are and continue to be matters of faith in science, but I hope you don't dismiss it because of this either.  All sciences do assume some things that make their view of the world make more sense.  But there are also other components of these theories which are consistently observed and understood that demand them... until they don't.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I don't give really any credence whatsoever when someone says 'this is a widely accepted theory by the scientific community'.  This in itself is not a scientific statement, but more the hope that someone else has one somewhere.

You start off with a blank program and a test (typically \"does it compile\") which the blank program fails but which it can be made to pass by a trivial amendment (such as adding a function called \"main\"). With that success under your belt you move on to another test - e.g. \"does it produce output\", which might be satisfied by the addition of a \"print 'dddagcahx'\" statement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose we've decided that the purpose of our shiny new program is to take a year and tell us whether or not it is a leap year. Then our next four tests, expressed in the sort of language commonly used for such tests, might be<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>    Assert.That(Year.IsLeap(1996), Is.True);\n    Assert.That(Year.IsLeap(1997), Is.False);\n    Assert.That(Year.IsLeap(1900), Is.False);\n    Assert.That(Year.IsLeap(2400), Is.True);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now it might seem that the next step would involve a \"big bang\" conversion of our \"print random nonsense\" program into a fully fledged leap year calculator,  but in fact we can pass two of the new tests simply by always outputting \"True\" (or alternatively always outputting \"False\") regardless of what input we are given. So we change \"print 'dddagcahx'\" to \"print 'True'\" (or print \"False\") and already we're passing four out of six tests. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.<\/p>\n\n<p>And so on. Even the largest program can be developed incrementally in this manner. Every small addition to the program is \"advantageous\" in that it enables the program to pass tests which it previously failed.<\/p>\n\n<p>It used to be that programs were not developed in this way. Back in the 80's, say, the prevailing philosophy was \"Big Design Up Front\". Not a line of code would be written until after months or even years of meticulous design had taken place. The big problem was that this typically didn't work. Millions would be spent on software projects which then had to be scrapped because of design flaws which only became apparent during implementation - or, worse, only when the program was in the hands of customers. This could have been averted if there had been a partially-functioning system at every stage of the development process.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the message of software development is that an intelligent design CAN be done like this, i.e. incrementally and \"where each line of code must be advantageous to the program\"; and it is the alternative \"it all happens at once\" approach which is problematic for reasons which you yourself have pointed out.<\/p>\n\n<p>(See e.g. <a href=\"http://exercism.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">exercism.io<\/a> for an excellent hands-on introduction to test-driven development.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":42152,"question_id":16212,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16212/building-intelligent-structure-with-random-evolution-requires-series-of-non-usef","last_activity_date":1452331717,"creation_date":1396157053,"answer_count":2,"title":"building intelligent structure with random evolution requires series of non useful steps","body":"<p>In order to build an intelligent design such as a bridge or a mechanical watch, you need a series of non useful steps.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I understand, in random evolution theory, the \"intelligence\" involved is the process of natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that natural selection requires that each step be advantageous right away.

The presence of infection in the bloodstream, or <strong>sepsis<\/strong>, is accompanied by a massive release of TNF-$\\alpha$ by macrophages in the liver, spleen, and other sites throughout the body. The systemic release of TNF-$\\alpha$ into the bloodstream causes vasodilation, which leads to a loss of blood pressure and increased vascular permeability, leading to a loss of plasma volume and eventually shock, known in this case as <strong>septic shock<\/strong> because the underlying cause is a bacterial infection.

Epub 2014 Aug 25.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abstract<br>\n  Cardiac arrhythmias are one of the main causes of death worldwide. Several studies have shown that inflammation plays a key role in different cardiac diseases and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) seem to be involved in cardiac complications. In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of TLR4 induces cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmias, and the signaling pathway involved in these effects. Membrane potential was recorded in Wistar rat ventricle. Ca(2+) transients, as well as the L-type Ca(2+) current (ICaL) and the transient outward K(+) current (Ito), were recorded in isolated myocytes after 24 h exposure to the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml). TLR4 stimulation in vitro promoted a cardiac electrical remodeling that leads to action potential prolongation associated with arrhythmic events, such as delayed afterdepolarization and triggered activity. After 24 h LPS incubation, Ito amplitude, as well as Kv4.3 and KChIP2 mRNA levels were reduced. The Ito decrease by LPS was prevented by inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not by inhibition of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Extrasystolic activity was present in 25% of the cells, but apart from that, Ca(2+) transients and ICaL were not affected by LPS; however, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) activity was apparently increased. We conclude that TLR4 activation decreased Ito, which increased AP duration via a MyD88-independent, IRF3-dependent pathway. The longer action potential, associated with enhanced Ca(2+) efflux via NCX, could explain the presence of arrhythmias in the LPS group.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":41958,"question_id":16305,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1452303905}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16305/how-does-sepsis-affect-heart-function","last_activity_date":1452304147,"creation_date":1396463848,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does sepsis affect heart function?","body":"<p>I have intuition that sepsis with infection can cause:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>spastic functioning of heart during systole<\/li>\n<li>heart working spontaneously in snatches during systole<\/li>\n<li>atrial fibrillation<\/li>\n<li>first contraction of ventricles ends earlier<\/li>\n<li>which follows Action potential from A-V node during relative refractory period<\/li>\n<li>weak second contraction<\/li>\n<li>long compensatory pause<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>which can be recorded as spikes in the time axis.<\/p>\n\n<p>With arrhythmic (earlier myocardial infarction) patients, sepsis seems to also cause leaking of valves, weakened compliance of vessels and structure of the heart. <\/p>\n\n<p>So there are creaking sounds in the spectrum spaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>How do the symptoms of sepsis affect heart function?<\/p>\n\n<p>I am thinking if it is possible that this leakiness of valves and weakened compliance last only for short term and occurs periodically, during which also the heart pumps more frequently load during extrasystoles. <\/p>\n\n<p>Assume that everything listed above is possible. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Can temporary acute/chronic inflammation in the heart cause such symptoms such as sudden weakening of valves and only temporary weakened compliance of coronary vessels?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think the reason can be thromboembolism which is causing the sudden spastic function and weakened function of vessels and heart structures.<\/p>\n","question_id":16305,"tags":["physiology","cardiology","electrocardiography","sepsis","sirs"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":161,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1452304147},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user10094"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a36c2a6d308a878faba903e217014094?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19295,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19295/emanuele-paolini","reputation":101,"display_name":"Emanuele Paolini"},"score":1,"post_id":39431,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444467622,"comment_id":66054,"body":"Maybe a good definition of &quot;foreign microorganism&quot; could be: a microorganism with a different DNA from the human host?"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/INPrd.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16651,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16651/amr","reputation":4081,"display_name":"AMR"},"score":12,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user10094"},"score":2,"post_id":39432,"edited":false,"creation_date":1444423900,"comment_id":66016,"body":"That not only is surprising, but gives also more interesting information.

When a single base change can change the amino acid sequence of a protein, that can add up to a huge amount of diversity, which is what we see over the nearly 8 billion humans on the planet, and the 99.5% sameness is why we are linked together so closely as a species.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can the lack of diversity be explained?<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The above quote was made by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. What this basically means is that you need to take a look at your question from the perspective of evolution and natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first thing you need to note is that there is evidence to suggest that modern humans went through a population bottleneck. What that means is that at a certain point in our history, there were very few individual members of our species alive and this can account for the \"lack\" of diversity that we see in our genome. The number that is quoted is as low as 10,000 individuals left alive after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">supereruption of the Toba volcano<\/a> about 75 thousand years ago. <\/p>\n\n<p>That means that there were very few mating pairs left, and that significantly reduced the genetic diversity of our species. This is known as Founder Effect.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Founder effects<\/h3>\n  \n  <p>A founder effect occurs when a new colony is started by a few members of the original population. This small population size means that the colony may have:<\/p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>reduced genetic variation from the original population.<\/li>\n  <li>a non-random sample of the genes in the original population.<\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So if we use an average of 20 to 25 years per human generation, we are only looking at about 3,000 to 4,000 generations since there were maybe only a few thousand breeding pairs of humans. Contrast that with bacteria which can go through three to four thousand generations in less than a week, and you can begin to get a feel for why there is so much sequence homology (sameness) in the human genome. See <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/bottlenecks_01\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bottlenecks and founder effects<\/a> at UC Berkley's Understanding Evolution site for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>You also should understand that any changes that are deleterious will be under strong selective pressure. This may not mean that the organism may not survive to reproduce, in may just mean that on average, they may be less successful; fewer offspring that have fewer offspring in comparison to the rest of the population. At some point that lineage may go extinct, either because the change makes it very difficult to survive, or the offspring make less desirable mates and eventually don't get the opportunity to reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any changes that disrupt a vital gene will likely be fatal and will lead to spontaneous abortion or if the mutation was sustained in a sperm, then the inability of that sperm to survive to fertilize an egg, so the sperm that was heavily mutated may just never make it to the egg. The average number of sperm in a single human ejaculation is about 250 million. And yet only a single sperm makes it to fertilize the egg, and that is assuming that a fertilization event takes place. There is an incredible amount of selection that goes on in the act of procreation, even before we get to development.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why the 99.5% to 0.5% figure might be misrepresentative of the population as a whole.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Another thing that you will want to think about is how the 0.5% to 99.5% number was arrived at. The referenced in the question links to a Wikipedia article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human Genetic Variation<\/a>. The reference provided for this was from a New York Times article about J. Craig Venter, <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1JrXFYA\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the Genome Race, the Sequel Is Personal<\/a> - Wade, Nicholas. September 4, 2007. The quote that is references in Wikipedia is:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Biologists had estimated that two individuals would be identical in 99.9 percent of their DNA, but the true figure now emerges as much less, around 99.5 percent, Dr. Scherer said.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The 0.5% figure is provided as a quote from Stephen W. Scherer, who was a coauthor of this paper, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human<\/a>, Levy, et.al. PLoS Biology; September 4, 2007. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254. From that paper the following quote is found:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inclusion of insertion and deletion genetic variation into our estimates of interchromosomal difference reveals that only 99.5% similarity exists between the two chromosomal copies of an individual and that genetic variation between two individuals is as much as five times higher than previously estimated.<br>\n  <sup>- <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human<\/a>, Levy, et.al. PLoS Biology; September 4, 2007.<br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So at the very least, the statement was made in a peer reviewed article. However there are some problems with this.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first is the method of the paper. It looks at a single human genome, that of Dr. Venter, and is used to draw the conclusion of 0.5% difference between <strong>any two individuals.<\/strong> And the comparison is made based on the analysis of differences between Dr. Venter's maternal chromosomes and paternal chromosomes. Let's look at what the problems might be here:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is a huge leap of statistical faith to assume that a single genome is representative of the nearly 8 billion genomes out there.<\/li>\n<li>Dr. Venter's genealogy is English on both parental lineages. We have to remember that there was another population bottleneck in middle ages Europe caused by outbreaks of <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/cholera/page4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">cholera<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Black Death<\/a>. This fact may imply that Dr. Venter's lineages are genetically close and that if his lineage were more diverse, say Indigenous Oceanian and English, they may have found a much higher percent difference between maternal and paternal chromosomes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The donor's three-generation pedigree is shown in Figure 1A. The donor has three siblings and one biological son, his father died at age 59 of sudden cardiac arrest. There are documented cases of family members with chronic disease including hypertension and ovarian and skin cancer. According to the genealogical record, the donor's ancestors can be traced back to 1821 (paternal) and the 1700s (maternal) in England. Genotyping and cluster analysis of 750 unique SNP loci discovered through this project support that the donor is indeed 99.5% similar to individuals of European descent (Figure 1B), consistent with self-reporting.<br>\n  <sup>- <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human<\/a>, Levy, et.al. PLoS Biology; September 4, 2007.<br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dr. Venter is male. The Y-chromosome was problematic to sequence, and you cannot really do a comparison between it and the X-chromosome. How would the genome of a woman compare?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Y chromosome is 59% covered by the one-to-one mapping due to difficulties when producing comparison between repeat rich chromosomes. In addition, the Y chromosome is more poorly covered because of the difficulties in assembling complex regions with sequencing depth of coverage only half that of the autosomal portion of the genome. The X chromosome coverage with HuRef scaffolds is at 95.2%, which is typical of the coverage level of autosomes (mean 98.3% using runs). However it is clear that the X chromosome has more gaps, as evidenced by the coverage with matches (89.4%) compared with the mean coverage of autosomes using matches (97.1%). The overall effects of lower sequence coverage on chromosomes X and Y are clearly evident as a sharp increase in number of gaps per unit length and shorter scaffolds compared to the autosomes (Figure 3). Similarity between the sex chromosomes is another source of assembly and mapping difficulties. For example, there is a 1.5-Mb scaffold that maps equally well to identical regions of the X and Y chromosomes and therefore cannot be uniquely mapped to either (see Materials and Methods and Figure 3). From our one-to-one mapping data, we are also able to detect the enrichment of large segmental duplications <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/12011238\" rel=\"nofollow\">10<\/a> on Chromosomes 9, 16, and 22, resulting in reduced coverage based on difficulties in assembly and mapping (Table S3).<br>\n  <sup>- <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human<\/a>, Levy, et.al. PLoS Biology; September 4, 2007.<br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There is another thing that you need to remember and that is the history of the Human Genome Project. Dr. Venter developed a new method of sequencing and became a commercial competitor to the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium project. While the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium project beat out Dr. Venter's enterprise(<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/science/04vent.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">8<\/a>), it's approach, to use an amalgamation of the DNA of many donors, some of whom had their DNA included and some who did not, to preserve anonymity, Dr. Venter circumvented this by performing the sequencing on his own DNA. When his team was beat out by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, he doubled-down, invested more time and effort and came up with the sequence put forth in this paper, which had a higher degree of resolution than previous efforts. The paper is making an argument for the value of their technique over the techniques being used by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium and is trying to make a claim of the superiority of their method. The data being presented is likely factual, but because of this history you have to look at the paper, the methods, and the motives behind it. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project\" rel=\"nofollow\">15.5 years since we had a full draft<\/a> of a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/12011238\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human Genome Project<\/a> produced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. In order to sequence that genome samples were taken from a few hundred individuals. Small stretches of the DNA were sequenced and then all of those pieces were put together in computer. That means that there was a lot of averaging that happened. So by default, the most prevalent base in the population of volunteers at every position was chosen. That means that that should be representative for the rest of the population as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>When we make statements about comparisons in datasets as large as the human genome, more often than not we are looking at known, small subsets of the genome, and we are extrapolating by statistical methods based on that fact. One thing you learn as you read science papers, and not just science news articles, is that you always need to look at their materials and methods to determine how they arrived at their data and headline numbers. It is often quoted that we have only a 1.5% difference between Humans and Chimpanzees, however when you look at those papers the comparisons were done only on areas of the genomes that lined up well. That isn't to say that there isn't a remarkable degree of similarity between us and our nearest living evolutionary relative, it is just that there is more to the story than the headline. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, we don't have that many full genomes sequenced to compare to one another, as a percentage of the 8 billion people alive today. While we have representations from most a vast majority of the ethnic groups identified, we may be missing families with novel lineages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing that you need to think about is that many of the areas in the human genome are repeats and structural elements that do not encode for genes of affect gene expression. Things like telomeres, which protect the ends of chromosomes, and centromeres which are the attachment points on chromosomes that make sure that the are distributed properly into newly divided cells. These elements tend to stay the same because the proteins that bind to them require that sequence specificity in order to function properly, so those are regions were almost every ones DNA will be the same, and not just between humans. These elements often are very similar in most vertebrates.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also need to consider structural RNAs. These molecules have functions within the cell that require that there sequences be highly conserved (unchanged). Ribosomal RNAs, Transfer RNAs, Small Nuclear RNAs all rely on their specific sequence to fold properly in order to perform their task in the cell. A single base change can change the folding of these elements and as a result they will loose their function, which means those cells won't be able to produce proteins properly which means that the cells will die. If this is happening in germline cells, then they are not going to be involved in fertilization so any mutations there will be passed on.<\/p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on, but the take away is that it isn't surprising that there is very little sequence diversity on a percentage bases within the human species, but there are many caveats to that fact as well.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong> Significant edits to add relevant, referenced information to back up answer.<\/p>\n","answer_id":41975,"question_id":41974,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1452275630}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/41974/why-are-the-genomes-of-humans-99-5-the-same","last_activity_date":1452275630,"creation_date":1451801542,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why are the genomes of Humans 99.5% the same?","body":"<p>Human's DNA sequence is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation\" rel=\"nofollow\">said to be roughly 99.5% equal<\/a>.

It is found not only on T-Lymphocytes, but also on macrophages and dendritic cells. Its function on T-cells is to stabilize the interaction between the T-Cell receptor and the MHC Class 2 (often known as HLA II in humans) antigen complex on antigen presenting cells and improves the affinity dramatically. <\/p>\n\n<p>CD4 is also vital for the activation of Helper T-Cells (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell#Development_in_the_thymus\">2<\/a>). It is needed in the signaling which occurs in the thymus that selects for CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-Cells.

Note that the T-helper TCR is composed of α/ß molecules associated with the CD3 complex and CD4. CD4 is associated with an intracellular tyrosine kinase called Lck. Upon recognition of MHC-II by CD4, Lck phosphorylates the CD3 complex intracellular tails and the ITAMs of the CD3 zeta chains in concert with Fyn. Zap70 binds these phosphorylated sites to transduce the signal further (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4#Function\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD4 function<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCR signal transduction<\/a>, and ignoring co-stimulation). To that, end there's some risk in knocking down CD4, or inadvertently modifying the receptor into loss-of-function.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knocking <em>out<\/em> CD4 in a human would probably result in something similar to SCID (severe-combined immunodeficiency syndrome). If you're unable to develop T helper cells (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v14/n6/full/nri3667.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thymic selection<\/a>), you're cutting off much of the ability for your immune system to modulate its defenses. B cells can still activate in a T-independent manner, but the types of antigens and responses are largely different (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell#T_cell-independent_activation\" rel=\"nofollow\">T-independent activation<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Being said<\/strong>, HIV primarily binds to CD4 through its gp120 membrane protein, and then facilitates membrane fusion through association with a chemokine coreceptor. Because of the above, you can't just delete CD4, it's quite dangerous from an organismal standpoint. Engineering a different receptor is a difficult way to go about it, as we don't know how that'll affect normal functioning, either. You can modify the chemokine, but it's also not guaranteed that the HIV wont shift to a different coreceptor (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_tropism\" rel=\"nofollow\">HIV tropism<\/a>). Thus the best preventions so far have been to block adsorption, block HIV normal functioning through antiretrovirals, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>The take-home message is that modifications to our own cells have a capacity to do a lot of harm, but through good experimental design we can also do a lot of good, see <a href=\"http://dmm.biologists.org/content/8/4/337\" rel=\"nofollow\">chimeric antigen receptor T cells<\/a>.

False positives are most commonly associated with the imaging. However, there are sometimes false negatives where you cannot see the concentration of lipid/cancer units, while you can in US. \nAssume no hormone replacement therapy (HRT), no history of breast surgery, and standardized body mass index. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is something about the imaging technique and its characteristics with some masses. Those masses have equal RTG characterization when summed up signals from fat, breast glands, breast ducts and cancerous masses. It would be great to understand when the RTG area has equal value. Which are the sufficient parameters and constraints that make enough sensitive RTG area?<\/p>\n\n<h2>Exclusions<\/h2>\n\n<p>Other factors<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No clinical examination before the imaging; too low dose of the radiation (O\u2019Leary \u2013 Rainford 2012). I think this one is most common reason why you get false negatives because suspicion of breast cancer has a different setting than a normal screening in the imaging. <\/li>\n<li>Too low radiation and hypothesis: no detectable Comptom scattering so no all-directional scattering. <\/li>\n<li>Exclude nursing mistakes about digital-analog, ...  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Problem setting<\/h2>\n\n<p>Only one kVp used in determining the quality of the image. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>minimize radiation by mAs (milli ampere seconds, intensity of x-ray beam i.e. image density; decreasing it darkens) and <strong>kVp<\/strong> (kilo volt peak) for penetrability so its decrease makes more gray image<\/li>\n<li>maximize sensitivity of the imaging<\/li>\n<li>which constraints?\n\n<ul>\n<li>range of radiation: 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz. How is the radiation region selected? Energy involved 15 to 30 keV. [1]<\/li>\n<li>no coherent scattering i.e. no Rayleigh scattering because breast tissue is gently pressured in the procedure so no fog. [2]<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>[conjuncture] Problem setting by two kVp and a convex problem<\/h2>\n\n<p>Use two kVp's which total radiation exposure is smaller than (1): <\/p>\n\n<p>\\begin{equation}\nx \\cdot kVp_{1} + (1-x) \\cdot kVp_{2} &lt; kVp. \n\\end{equation}<\/p>\n\n<p>Combine the two images, reducing the fog. \nI think this way can contribute better quality of mammography imaging. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Radiation exposure control and quality assurance by kVp<\/h2>\n\n<p>Increasing kVp 15% doubles radiation exposure. [3] So kVp squared to the radiation exposure relationship:<\/p>\n\n<p>\\begin{equation}\n(kVp) \\propto (Ex)^{2}\n\\end{equation}<\/p>\n\n<p>Which are the energy settings used in the RTG? Determined apparently mainly by kVp which misses relevant bands at least with low energy radiation. Most probably as continuous energy spectrum because only the peak is determined. The current RTG settings should include regions of the greatest sensitivity but I did not find any prioritizing by specific regions, only the kVp. I need studies about the sensitivity of kVp in the quality assurance of the mammography. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources<\/h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Jerrold T.

Let me know if I am answering your question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic algorithm vs simulation of evolutionary processes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think that the whole issue comes from a confusion between the concept of simulating evolutionary processes and the use of genetic algorithm (type of optimization algorithm) for various purposes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Genetic algorithm<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm (and the OP knows much more than I do in this field) aiming to find solutions to search problems. The accuracy of the analogy between a genetic algorithm and the biological reality that inspired such algorithm is completely irrelevant to the usefulness of the algorithm at doing a specific task (such as the NP-hard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">travelling salesman problem<\/a> for example).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Numerical simulations in science<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think your question is not specific to evolutionary biology but rather to science as a whole (this leads me to think that Philosophy.SE would be a good place to ask such question).<\/p>\n\n<p>In natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology and others), we model things! We abstract the essentials from a complicated world and model it. When we model, we assume a number of properties of the system of interest. These assumptions might be extremely well documented and verified or not. When the assumptions of a model are not well documented, it is of course essential to study a posteriori the robustness of the model to violation of the assumptions and to consider the results of the model with a pinch of salt. A model can be purely verbal or most often expressed in mathematical formulations. However, many complex systems cannot be modelled mathematically (even for the most brilliant mathematicians). This is where numerical simulations come into play. Note that once a process has been modelled, we empirically investigate the accuracy of our model by formulating predictions and testing them.<\/p>\n\n<p>You say:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if we cannot simulate a process, we have not understood it properly<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If we already understood a process, there is no point spending time and money to simulate it anyway! So again, this sentence suggests that numerical simulations is worthless in science. It is true though that we can only simulate the processes for which we know the basic components (but we might not understand the dynamic of a system of interest).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Simulations in Evolutionary biology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You cite one work (which I am not familiar with) which fail to reproduce the observed pattern. In other words, the predictions of the model are not met/observed in reality.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I said above, one needs to understand the basic components of a system in order to be able to simulate it. We happen to already know a faire amount of stuff! Of course, it is impossible to address the question \"what do we know in Biology\" as it would be way too broad. There are thousands of studies that have used numerical simulations (and also mathematical simulations) to study evolutionary processes.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Example<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine for example, you are interested to know the probability for a given new neutral mutation to rise in frequency in a diploid population to reach \"fixation\" (that is a frequency of 1; everybody then carry this mutant allele). There exists a number of mathematical models (Wright-Fisher (binomial) model of genetic drift, Moran (Birth-death) model and Coalescence (branching process) model) to calculate this probability but let's assume we fail to develop such mathematical/analytical model and and we need to simulate it. We could simulate this process a lot of time (using a ABC kind of approach) and calculate the expected probability of such mutant allele to get fixed. Btw, this probability is $\\frac{1}{2N}$, where $N$ is the effective population size.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Want to know more?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I am not a philosopher of science (but a PhD student using numerical tools to model evolutionary processes) and I think the question is not specific to evolutionary biology. I would recommend to ask the question <code>What is usefulness of numerical modelling in science?<\/code> or <code>Are numerical modeling worth as much as analytical modelling in science?<\/code> on <a href=\"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/\">Philosophy.SE<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you do so, can you please link to your posts here, I would love reading the answers.

In that paper they explain how they \"walked\" along the chromosome to reach the Bithorax Complex (BX-C).<\/p>\n\n<p>This approach requires two reagents:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a cloned DNA fragment that you have mapped to a defined genetic interval, and possibly to a cytogenetic interval as well (this is only possible if the organism in question has cytogenetic tools).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>a genomic library of larger cloned DNA fragments.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Step 1. Use the DNA fragment to screen the library and isolate genomic clones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Step 2. Purify each genomic clone and prepare enough DNA to construct a restriction map of the foreign insert (N.B., Bender <em>et al<\/em>., actually used heteroduplex mapping--an EM-based technique--as well) in each clone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Isolate a suitable DNA fragment, devoid of repetitive DNA, from one end of the clone that extends the farthest along the genome in the direction in which you wish to \"walk\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Step 4. Congratulations, you have taken one \"step.\" Now use the new DNA fragment as a probe and screen the genomic library again.  Each time you screen the library you will recover all of the genomic clones that hybridize, or overlap, with the fragment you are using as a probe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Step 5. --> go back to Step 2. above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each time you take another \"step\" you are isolating cloned DNA that is taking you closer to your target (the gene of interest).  For the very first step you will not know which clone is extending in the desired direction (typically) so you need some type of complementary assay to decide which end of the overlapping clones' restriction map is the direction you want to pursue. In other words, you need to align the physical map to the genetic map. In <em>Drosophila<\/em> one can use  <em>in situ<\/em> hybridization to polytene chromosome squashes to visualize where the genomic clones are derived from in the genome, and this lets you pick the correct clone at that first step.<\/p>\n\n<p>Periodically during the walk you will need to test the new genomic clones by <em>in situ<\/em> to find out when you are getting close to your target (or if you have even walked past your destination).<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally you will have some chromosomal rearrangements that alter the physical and genetic maps, and let you unambiguously determine when the chromosomal walk has reached, or entered, the locus.  Alternatively, a strong loss-of-function mutation in your target gene might be a deletion or deficiency that causes a RFLP, and isolating genomic DNA from such a mutant will let you use a Southern Blot to confirm that you have reached the gene.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42085,"question_id":42069,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42069/chromosomomal-walking","last_activity_date":1452166835,"creation_date":1452097642,"answer_count":1,"title":"Chromosomomal walking","body":"<p>I'm having a great deal of trouble understanding chromosomal walking, especially in regards to this article: <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400818024\" rel=\"nofollow\">Control of male sexual behavior and sexual orientation in <em>Drosophila<\/em> by the fruitless gene.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I can get the fact that you can use recombination frequency analysis with chromosomal markers to assess the relative position of a gene, but I'm just stumped as to what it exactly it means when they say that they cloned the gene using DNA segments flanking the two insertions (fru3 and fru4) as a basis for the chromosomal walk.<\/p>\n","question_id":42069,"tags":["genetics","molecular-biology","molecular-genetics"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":42085,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1452166835},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eghgy.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5669,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5669/dexterdev","reputation":560,"display_name":"dexterdev","accept_rate":73},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/INPrd.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16651,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16651/amr","reputation":4081,"display_name":"AMR"},"score":1,"post_id":42095,"edited":false,"creation_date":1452201852,"comment_id":71990,"body":"This will get you started. <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cm.21107/abstract;jsessionid=EBF0685F3478FC631384AAFB5007A909.f02t01?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=\" rel=\"nofollow\">onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cm.21107/&hellip;<\/a> You will need to look at their citations to likely find answers to your exact answers."}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42095/where-can-i-find-the-pathway-for-camp-signaling-in-dictyostelium","last_activity_date":1452165078,"creation_date":1452161297,"answer_count":0,"title":"Where can I find the pathway for cAMP signaling in Dictyostelium?","body":"<p>I wanted the cyclic-AMP signaling pathway network of social amoeba <em>Dictyostelium discoideum<\/em> (which is necessary for the understanding of its \"aggregation\" life cycle) with rate constants and other details.

While there are some immunoglobulins produced that detect these molecules, the majority detect proteins<\/li>\n<li>Most antibodies are produced against the functional conformation of the protein, so its tertiary or quaternary structure. When polypeptides are loaded into MHC II, it is a small piece of the primary sequence of amino acids. This is used to activate CD4+ helper T-Cells.<\/li>\n<li>Vaccine is given in one of three ways; subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or orally (including nasally). Most antibodies circulate in the blood until they leak out of the blood vessels at the site of an infection. Also free antibody have half-lives of between 7 to 21 days, so even if there had been IgG in the tissue from a prior inoculation, it is unlikely that any will be at the site of the new inoculation without an inflammatory response taking place.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Oral vaccines will encounter IgA molecules in the mucus, so if they were made from a prior immunization, they could opsonize the vaccine, however, it is likely given in a high enough dose that some of the vaccine will reach the antigen presenting cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>When delivered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, the vaccine will first be encountered by the innate immune system, even if adaptive immune cells were activated in previous rounds of vaccination. It is very unlikely that IgG will be encountered at the site of the inoculation, as IgG circulates in the blood and only ever really gets into the site of inoculation or infection after the innate immune cells have initiated an inflammatory response leading to the permeabilization of the blood vessels, allowing other immune cells and immunoproteins access to the site of the infection. Either way, APCs will be taking up the vaccine before the antibodies against them can neutralize them.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also likely a good thing that there are CD4+ cells in circulation that recognize a sequence of the adjuvant. If the B cell phagocytoses the vaccine and adjuvant, such as with a flagellin fusion vaccine, because there was specificity for an epitope on the target protein (vaccine), then even though the B cell is not making an antibody to the adjuvant, putting the adjuvant sequence on the MHC II means that it can be activated by a helper T-cell that recognized the adjuvant polypeptide, even if there is no T-cells that recognize the vaccine.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40325,"question_id":40324,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1446939307}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40324/how-body-doesnt-make-antibodies-against-adjuvants-of-vaccine","last_activity_date":1452128336,"creation_date":1446784324,"answer_count":1,"title":"how body doesn't make antibodies against adjuvants of vaccine?","body":"<p>we know that all antigenic molecules don't have PRR on phagocytes and so they use an adjuvant that has a receptor for pattern recognation and fuse it with in order to phagocyte the antigen-adjuvant complex and present it on MHC II molecules for antibody syntheses now the question arises the phagocytes don't know which molecule is antigen and which is adjuvant then why MHC II molecules don't present the adjuvants for antibody syntheses and make the body sensitive against adjuvant and future vaccination should not be successful because the antibody recognises the adjuvant binds with it and not letting the vaccine to be processed? <\/p>\n","question_id":40324,"tags":["immunology","vaccination"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31d1b05179bfd14b13b5bb492cecb6ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15379,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15379/user3293056","reputation":129,"display_name":"user3293056"},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d7c5cbd0c2f965a3712ff687c53f997?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14552,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14552/aaaaaa","reputation":2058,"display_name":"aaaaaa"},"score":0,"post_id":31467,"edited":false,"creation_date":1429342715,"comment_id":52734,"body":"then everything i a byproduct of some need. eyes -- byproduct of the need to catch prey. something wrong with that attitude..."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":31467,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d7c5cbd0c2f965a3712ff687c53f997?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14552,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14552/aaaaaa","reputation":2058,"display_name":"aaaaaa"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1429369488,"comment_id":52743,"body":"I think indeed that this kind of terminology easily lead to some issue.

Different fluorophores may be related to different damage to the eye.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A major hydrophobic component of RPE lipofuscin is the fluorophore A2E...

The question is: how fast can this voltage get to the sodium channels?<\/p>\n\n<p>In an unmyelinated axon, the movement of voltage across the membrane is due to ion flux (i.e the flow of ions through the channels, the current), and this movement is limited by the time it takes for the sodium ions to diffuse into the axon. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in a myelinated axon, the first bolus of sodium enters at the axon hillock.  Because the capacitance is low, this means that the voltage can propagate down the axon, not by ion diffusion, but as an electrical field.  The electrical field carries the voltage force much much faster than ion diffusion. Therefore, when the ions first enter, the voltage force moves, basically at the speed of light to the next node, where the voltage force opens the sodium ion channels there.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So, by allowing the voltage to be carried by the electrical field, the effect is that the distance between the nodes is effectively eliminated.  Myelinated axons conduct faster because they are >>effectively&lt;&lt; much shorter than unmyelinated axons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, the optimized distance between nodes mentioned by Luke is exactly that distance in a given type of neuron's axon where the voltage force decays to the bare minimum needed to activate the sodium ion channels at the next node.<\/p>\n","answer_id":10507,"question_id":8282,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8282/why-is-saltatory-conduction-faster-than-continuous-conduction","last_activity_date":1452033877,"creation_date":1368126375,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why is saltatory conduction faster than continuous conduction?","body":"<p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. <\/p>\n\n<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na+ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na+ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na+, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na+ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.<\/strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really \"either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum\", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na+ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously<\/em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore.

For example many spiders have four, six or eight eyes whilst worms have none, but all are animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, the reason typical mammals have two eyes is probably similar to the reason that cars usually have four wheels, the reason houses keep out the rain and why coffee cups have handles. It's because that's what works. <\/p>\n\n<p>Each time an organism develops, there is a high chance that the genetic information that built it will include something new. When that happens, most often the phenotype (essentially, the organism's appearance, such as how many eyes it has) does not change. The organism looks the same as its parent(s) did. If something significant does change, it is most likely to be bad news for the new organism. The chances are the organism will not survive and the particular genetic information that built it will not used again. Hence, organisms don't tend to be that different to their parent(s). Dogs don't give birth to cats.<\/p>\n\n<p>But just rarely, this new combination produces something different and useful - useful enough that the organism is particularly successful and a good fit for its environment. In that case, simply because it can, the organism has more offspring and more of those offspring themselves survive to have offspring of their own. The genetic information that built the organism is thus used to create more, similar organisms. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, the first eyes were produced by accident. When eyes turned out to be useful, subsequent generations from the first organism with eyes were more likely to have eyes themselves. As it turns out, analysis of genomes shows that eyes have evolved like this multiple times.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can only assume that since mammals typically have two eyes, either the random genetic accident that would produce different numbers of eyes in mammals has never happened, or if it did happen, the result was not a good fit to the environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why not no eyes? Human beings are occasionally born without eyes and the cause may be genetically inherited. One might reasonably imagine that for much of human history such a child would be unlikely to survive into adulthood and thus pass on this mutation. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why not one eye? One reason in the case of primates is that two eyes are useful for estimating distance, which is difficult with one eye. A two-eyed animal has an advantage against predators, making it more likely the next generation is going to have two eyes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why not more than two eyes? Perhaps a larger number of eyes requires a larger head making childbirth impossible, or perhaps it requires too much energy to sustain. Who knows? What we observe today - humans typically have two eyes - means that, if that mutation for more than two eyes did happen at some stage, then more than two eyes wasn't optimal for the environment in which the resulting organism found itself, so it didn't get passed on to the next generation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42028,"question_id":42025,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42025/why-do-we-have-two-eyes","last_activity_date":1452004081,"creation_date":1452000390,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why do we have two eyes?","body":"<p>Humans, animals and birds all have two eyes.

I really like this concept, but I also read that this treatment is usually a waste of money because the EM only survives in very specific conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is if it would be possible/feasible to make an advanced and evolving form of EM with a computer that systematically injects very small doses of specific bacteria into a sample and logs their effect on the sample.

The outermost layer of the chameleon\u2019s skin is transparent. Beneath this layer are the chromatophores. The deepest layer contains melanophores, which are filled with melanin.

This is the view that traits tend to evolve for some kind of adaptive reason, therefore most traits (and demographic patterns of variation) exist for some kind of purpose. A selectionist would argue that blonde hair offers some kind of advantage in Scandinavia, over other hair colours, that it doesn't in others. It could be a naturally or sexually selected advantage (perhaps blonde hair is more useful when hunting prey in snow, or there is mate preference for blonde individuals etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>In the 1960's though a scientist called Motoo Kimura proposed the neutral theory, a theory that most variation and traits have evolved by neutral processes.

A slit pupil gives higher visual acuity vertically than horizontally because of diffraction and when a slit pupil is very nearly shut, there's high diffraction in the horizontal direction giving poor horizontal visual acuity. A round pupil on the other hand gives a creature the highest visual acuity in all directions for a given area of pupil. A smaller pupil is better for reducing chromatic aberration but chromatic aberration can be pretty much neglected because for any creature with evolutionary pressure for sharp vision in all directions, good accomodation will ensure at least one wavelength of light focuses onto the retina forming a sharp image because the sun emits a continuous range of wavelengths.<\/p>\n","answer_id":33013,"question_id":7492,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/INPrd.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16651,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16651/amr","reputation":4081,"display_name":"AMR"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1451864567,"creation_date":1451864567,"body":"<p>There was a study published <strike>this<\/strike> last year (2015) that suggests that the pupil style of an animal is related to its strategy for predation.

Species with vertically elongated pupils are very likely to be ambush predators and active day and night. Species with horizontally elongated pupils are very likely to be prey and to have laterally placed eyes. Vertically elongated pupils create astigmatic depth of field such that images of vertical contours nearer or farther than the distance to which the eye is focused are sharp, whereas images of horizontal contours at different distances are blurred. This is advantageous for ambush predators to use stereopsis to estimate distances of vertical contours and defocus blur to estimate distances of horizontal contours. Horizontally elongated pupils create sharp images of horizontal contours ahead and behind, creating a horizontally panoramic view that facilitates detection of predators from various directions and forward locomotion across uneven terrain.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vY9gk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vY9gk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Figure 1. <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/7/e1500391.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why do animal eyes have pupils of different shapes?<\/a> Banks, et. al.
