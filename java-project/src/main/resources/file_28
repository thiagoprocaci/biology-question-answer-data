Since rods don't provide color information, it can be concluded that focused, color-coded information is conveyed by <strong>3 million<\/strong> photoreceptors per retina.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, however, it is important to note that the brain fills in missing gaps. For example, the optic disc, i.e. the point where the optic nerve leaves the eye, measures about 1.5 mm in diameter <a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-i-foundations/simple-anatomy-of-the-retina/\">(Kolb, 2011)<\/a>. Given that the total diameter of the retina is about 30-40 mm this is quite a big blind spot. The brain simply fills in that gap by estimating what supposed to be there. In fact, many people with degenerative diseases of the retina don't even notice their deficits until they start bumping into objects that they did not notice. However, they do not see black holes, but instead their brain has been filling in the gaps with the information available in the remaining image, just like it does with the optic disc in normally-seeing people.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1427131\">Jonas <em>et al<\/em>, <em>Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol<\/em> (1992); <strong>230<\/strong>(6):505-10<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-iii-retinal-circuits/circuitry-for-rod-cells-through-the-retina/\">Kolb, <em>Webvision<\/em>, The Organization of the Retina and Visual System, Simple Anatomy of the Retina (2011)<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-iii-retinal-circuits/circuitry-for-rod-cells-through-the-retina/\">Kolb, <em>Webvision<\/em>, The Organization of the Retina and Visual System, \nCircuitry for Rod Signals Through The Retina (2011)<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":40787,"question_id":40607,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1447940029}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40607/how-many-mega-pixels-does-the-eye-have","last_activity_date":1447989538,"creation_date":1447499395,"answer_count":2,"title":"How many mega pixels does the eye have?","body":"<p>What is the number of mega pixels available in the human eye?

Be it, Cobra, Krait or Viper. It is the universal truth that, all the snake venom is 90% protein and out of that, 60% is the lethal inflammatory toxic enzyme called Phospholipase A2 (PLA2).  PLA2 is an enzyme that breaks down the cellular plasma membrane containing phospholipid and allows the entry of toxic enzyme.  The toxic enzyme let loose a cascade of events that goes through cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathway with release of arachidonic acid - 20 carbon fatty acid which forms the precursor of pain causing inflammatory by-products.  Since, Turmeric can destroy the activity of phospholipase A2,the inflammation and accompanying inflammation reduced considerably and the life of the patient extended by two to three hours giving time for the anti-venom antibody treatment. The attractive feature of the above \"On the spot\" treatment by Turmeric is that, the snake can be any species because PLA2 is the key toxic enzyme in all the venoms. The way to administer Turmeric on the field is to take two to three fist full of Turmeric powder and dissolve it in warm water, then it is filtered through a clean cloth and the clear extract without any residue about a glass is given to drink by the patient when it is warm.  The rest of the water is used to continuously washed the bitten spot so that, the local inflammation is subsidized. You may refer the to the following publications where it is shown that Turmerin, a water soluble antioxidant protein from Turmeric binds to PLA2 distal to the active site and changes the conformation of Phospholipase A2 in such a way that, it is no more hypertoxic.

As such, even the tiniest fluctuations in light can be registered with your peripheral vision; much more so than your primary field of vision. In this case, it may well have been that the light was flickering very subtly, or at a very high frequency, which your primary field of vision could not pick up. When your peripheral vision was in play, it immediately spotted the flicker.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is reliant on a principle called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold\">flicker fusion threshold<\/a>, which essentially states that there is a threshold of various light properties (including flicker frequency, colour, intensity, etc.) at which an eye begins to distinguish a steady light from a flickering one. Research has demonstrated that species who have high rod density are good at picking up flickering, whereas species with low rod densities have a much poorer threshold. Cone density doesn't seem to factor in very much, since flickering is primarily a change of intensity rather than hue.<\/p>\n\n<p>This transfers into the human eye, since we have a high rod density (and low cone density) at the edges of our retinas, i.e. in our peripheral vision. If you had the eyes of another species (as creepy as that would be) with a high rod density, you may well have been able to detect the flicker quite easily with your primary field of vision.<\/p>\n\n<p>To directly answer your question - yes, I believe this is primarily the \"fault\" of the eye, rather than the brain. The brain has a role in identifying the flicker at a subconscious level, in terms of fight or flight response, but the eye is responsible for providing the elevated sensitivity at the peripheral.<\/p>\n","answer_id":7448,"question_id":7445,"up_vote_count":7}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7445/perception-of-artificial-light-flickering","last_activity_date":1447951934,"creation_date":1362481949,"answer_count":1,"title":"Perception of artificial light - flickering","body":"<p>I noticed something strange a couple of years ago.

Some trees can stand more shade than others, and these will send branches into the shade of buildings. They never grow as dense or robust in the shade. The reason for the plants growing toward the light is Phototropism. When light hits the plant stem, the auxins that determine the length of the stem are destroyed, decreasing the amount of growth on that side of the stem. When this happens, the stems bend toward the light source from the imbalance of auxins in the stem. The reason that the shady side is weaker is that all trees rely on photosynthesis for their energy. Of course, the side without direct sunlight will not perform as much photosynthesis, and so has that much less energy to grow with. Also, many large trees are imbalanced, sometimes all of the weight on one side.

As far as I know there is no active control to restore plant symmetry once it has gone awry (but I could be wrong!) but the inhibitory effect of auxin synthesised at the meristem and diffusing in all directions causes a symmetrical pattern of inhibition and activation, forming shoots at symmetrical distances around the shoot apical meristem \u2013 this is very visible in the symmetry of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli\" rel=\"nofollow\">romanesco broccoli<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Fractal_Broccoli.jpg/320px-Fractal_Broccoli.jpg\" alt=\"Romanesco\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there are several mechanisms involving auxin which shape the general growth of the plant.

Konrad has touched on it in his answer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The reason trees, and most plants, tend to grow equally in all directions is that they have iteratively generated branching and radial symmetry which is controlled in a feedback loop of the growth promoting hormone auxin and auxin-sensitive auxin transporters. This is an elegant biological algorithm which explains all branching growth.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The things Konrad identifies (phototropism, gravitropism, etc.) serve as orientation cues which help the plant determine which axes to grow along, but fundamentally the process is about auxin gradients. There are exceptions, as others have pointed out in their answers, and they usually result from severe imbalances in the orientation cues.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll try to explain the growth process clearly (and it gives me an opportunity to try my hand at diagramming again ^_^)...<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Auxin is a plant hormone (actually a class of hormones, but mostly when people say auxin, they mean <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole-3-acetic_acid\">indole-3-acetic acid<\/a>) which promotes cell elongation and division. The basic principle which allows auxin to act in the organising way it does is that auxin is produced inside cells, and proteins which export auxin from a cell develop on the side of the cell which has the highest auxin concentration (see figure below).<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VGbXI.png\" alt=\"cells export auxin more on the side which has the highest auxin concentration\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So auxin gets transported up the concentration gradient of auxin!<\/strong> Thus if you get an area of high auxin concentration developing somehow, more auxin is then transported towards that area. An area of high auxin concentration relative to the surrounding tissue is called an <strong>auxin maximum<\/strong> (plural 'maxima').<\/p>\n\n<p>For most of the life of the plant, auxin is produced pretty much equally in most cells. However, at the very early stages of embryo development, it gets produced preferentially along the embryonic axis (see figure below, <strong>part 1<\/strong>). That creates a <strong>meristem<\/strong> - a group of cells where cell division is taking place - at the auxin maximum at each end of the embryo. Since this particular meristem is at the apex of the plant, it is called the <strong>apical meristem<\/strong>, and it is usually the strongest one in the plant.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bSY6i.png\" alt=\"auxin patterning of plant growth\"><\/p>\n\n<p>So by having a meristem at each end, the embryo then elongates as cell division is only taking place at those points. This leads to <strong>part 2<\/strong> of the image above, where the two meristems get so far apart that the auxin gradient is so weak as to no longer have its organising effect (area in the red square). When that happens, the auxin produced in cells in that area concentrates in a chaotic way for a short time until another center of transport is created. This happens, as the first one did, when a particular area of the tissue has a slightly higher concentration of auxin, and so auxin in the surrounding tissue is transported towards it. This leads to <strong>part 3<\/strong> of the figure, in which two new meristems are created on the sides of the plant (called <strong>lateral meristems<\/strong>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Lateral meristems are where branches occur on plants. If you then imagine this process continuing to iterate over and over, you will see that the branches, as they elongate, will develop meristems at the tips and along the sides. The main stem will also continue elongating, and develop more lateral stems. The root will begin to branch, and those branches will branch, etc. If you can understand how this elegant system works, you understand how plants grow, and why they grow in repeating units as opposed to in a body plan like animals.<\/p>\n\n<p>It also explains why, if you cut off the tip of a stem, it promotes branching. By removing the apical meristem, you get rid of the auxin gradient and enable the creating of multiple smaller meristems which each develop into branches.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far I've explained regular branching, but the same system causes the radial symmetry which makes trees (usually) grow in all directions equally...<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/81e6B.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine taking a cross section through a stem and looking down all the way through it (as depicted crudely above). Just as auxin gradients act to coordinate growth along the length of the plant, they also coordinate it radially, as the maxima will tend to space themselves out as far from one another as possible. That leads to branches growing in all directions equally (on average).<\/p>\n\n<p>I welcome comments on this answer, as I think its so important to understanding plant growth that I'd like to hone my answer to make it as good as possible.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2646,"question_id":1869,"up_vote_count":19}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1869/how-do-trees-manage-to-grow-equally-in-all-directions","last_activity_date":1447901936,"creation_date":1334757442,"answer_count":4,"title":"How do trees manage to grow equally in all directions?","body":"<p>I was walking down a road with these beautifully huge trees when this question occurred to me. <\/p>\n\n<p>Large trees with many thick branches have to grow equally in all directions, or they would tip over.

Normal cells have a proper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EB8q9aR8Hk\" rel=\"nofollow\">cell cycle<\/a> with all the \"checkpoints\" working normally to essentially throw away any cells that detract from the cycle in any way. They also have mechanisms to fix DNA that has been damaged before it gets replicated. If none of that works they have mechanisms to basically commit suicide so they never replicated.

The eye size is tightly regulated genetically. Babies don't have big eyes, they have exactly the same sized eyes like adults, only their head is smaller. Myopic eyes are larger than normal and hyperopic eyes are smaller than normal, even though the difference is only 1 to a few millimeters. When you focus to the far point, the light focusses to the nearest point possible in the back of your eye. When you come closer to an object, the focus point inside the eye moves further out. Thus, the farsighted person with the small eye can only see when the object is away. Moving closer moves the focal point inside the eye to behind the retina. The opposite is true for myopic people with too large eyes. When a person gets old, the lens gets stiff and cannot adjust the focal point inside the eye to the distance of the retina. Thus, the lens remains stiff in the most relaxed state (extended), or - in other words - at the most distant focal point the person had when it was young. A normal-sighted person has his old-age focal point at the horizon and since his lens is stiff, can only see sharp from the horizon to a few meters in front of him (depending on the intensity and wavelength of the light - blue light better than red). A short-sighted person is of disadvantage when old, since his far point remains to be at short distance. He gains a little sharpness over the normal sighted person in the short distance, but loses it in the distance like he always did. You can calculate this nicely, actually.

It seems then that nearsightedness is more of an adaptation that occurs at a young age, so that these people can work up close for longer periods of time both in the the short term(studying) and long term(age).

This temperature is generally very high, around $90^oC$ to $100^oC$ depending on your sequence. At this temperature many proteins will not function, hence you need thermostable polymarase.

It's by no means predictive and probably largely indiscernible from random chance, but hey it's something!<\/p>\n\n<p>More to the point, at the very least you might as well just guess their next child will be a <strong>son<\/strong>.  As the link above will tell you, the human sex ratio at birth has varied but in general males are more likely to be born - somewhere <a href=\"http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3a52%3btimeID%3a113&amp;c=2,4,6,7&amp;s=_crEngNameOrderBy%3aasc,_timeEngNameOrderBy%3adesc,_varEngNameOrderBy%3aasc&amp;v=1\">around 1.03 to 1.08<\/a> males per female.

I wish there were more information on the variances - clearly there's more down by the 8th child - but that's pretty solid.  Here's another study from <a href=\"http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/150/9/957.full.pdf\">Denmark in 1999<\/a> doing some of the same stuff (Denmark was <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10601107\">popular<\/a> for this work).  They include the absolutely <em>fascinating<\/em> Table 2 (below), which breaks down the odds of giving birth to a male given whatever came before.

They used about 1.4 million kids but there are some interesting oddities in that table at the extremes.  The best chance for a male?  Your fifth kid, following FMFM.  Best for a female?  Your fifth, after MMMF.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some definite issues that can twist the data, particularly when families have another kid to try to get a child of a specific sex.  If you can tease out some of those environmental factors, you'd be better at guessing; still, I wouldn't bet the house on it.

There is something that @Crags has overlooked, though, and that is the caveat <em>\"Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable\"<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMUNo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I would consider that sentence to be quite correct. A <em>good prognosis<\/em> is very different from a <em>cure<\/em>. Most of the surgeons, radiation therapists and oncologists I have worked with make that distinction. (Even surgeons, whose mottoes include \"A chance to cut is a chance to cure.\" and \"Nothing heals like cold hard steel.\" are careful not to use the word <em>cure<\/em>, unless it <em>is<\/em> a cure.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not an oncologist, but oncologists do write papers. From one of them:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>METHODS: We analysed postmenopausal women with localised invasive breast cancer. The primary endpoint <strong>disease-free survival (DFS)<\/strong>, and the secondary endpoints <strong>time to recurrence (TTR)<\/strong>, incidence of new contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), <strong>time to distant recurrence (TTDR)<\/strong>, overall survival (OS), and death after recurrence were assessed... FINDINGS: <strong>At a median follow-up of <em>100 months<\/em> (range 0-126), DFS, TTR, TTDR, and CLBC were improved significantly in the ITT and hormone-receptor-positive populations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Although this study only followed patients for 100 months (8.3 years), some studies are much longer, and a cure is what you or I would think of as a cure: <em>disease-free survival<\/em>, not of months, but for a lifetime, that is, non-recurrence of the cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your professors sound like they are using the standard approach to <em>cure<\/em>, which is to hedge one's bets: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In medicine, a disease is considered cured when it\u2019s been successfully treated and does not return. <em>The concept of \u201ccure\u201d is difficult to apply to cancer because undetected cancer cells can sometimes remain in the body after treatment, causing the cancer to return later (referred to as a recurrence or relapse).<\/em> Many cancers are considered \u201ccured\u201d when there is no cancer detected five years after diagnosis. However, recurrence after five years is still possible.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the past, <em>cure<\/em> was defined as 5-years cancer free. We now know that that is survival, not cure. The same can be said of 10 years (thought that one runs more true to <em>cure<\/em>). The fact is, most studies don't follow patients indefinitely. That doesn't mean no cancer is \"cured\". The patients (even many of those in the xkcd comic) without recurrence are <em>cured<\/em>. Therefore it is a fallacy to say cancer can never be cured. Semantics and statistics are at play.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I said in my comments, there are <em>curable cancers<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Curable cancers: non-invasive basal cell carcinoma:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nearly every basal cell cancer can be cured, especially when the cancer is found early and treated.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>(This is not a hedge.

Patients with lower pretreatment PSA levels and lower Gleason scores may require longer follow-up than those with less favorable characteristics to achieve the same certainty of cure. Patients who achieve a PSA nadir ≤ 0.4 ng/mL and require ≥ 2.0 years to reach this nadir have the highest probability of cure. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Cervical cancer:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Colorectal cancer:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conclusion: Patients who survive 10 years appear to be cured of their disease, whereas approximately one third of actual 5-year survivors succumb to a cancer-related death.

The goal of the IU is to be able to compare these, so that different forms or preparations with the same biological effect will contain the same number of IUs. To do so, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization provides a reference preparation of the agent, arbitrarily sets the number of IUs contained in that preparation, and specifies a biological procedure to compare other preparations of the same agent to the reference preparation. Since the number of IUs contained in a new substance is arbitrarily set, there is no equivalence between IU measurements of different biological agents. For instance, one IU of vitamin E cannot be equated with one IU of vitamin A in any way, including mass or efficacy.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For hCG, in the 55th report for of the WHO Expert Commitee on Biological Standardization, you could find:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, after consideration of this issue (11), concluded that the choice of unit should be made on a case-by-case basis and reflect, and be based on, the biological and medical as well as the physicochemical information available. \n  Many biologicals exist in both active and inactive states, and the clinically relevant form of the analyte may depend on the diagnostic aim. For example, the active state of the placental hormone chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is the relevant molecule to measure in the diagnosis of pregnancy, whereas the biologically inactive free beta subunit (hCG-beta) is measured to diagnose choriocarcinoma. Generally, a measurement of biological activity is expressed in IU, whereas measurement of the amount of a protein or of a specific protein structure is expressed in SI. In this case there would be a compelling reason to relate the measurement of hCG to a unit of biological activity, and the measurement of hCG-beta to an SI unit of quantity. Accordingly WHO has established a reference preparation for hCG (currently the fourth International Standard, with an assigned content of 650 IU/ampoule) (7) and a reference preparation for hCG-beta (currently the first WHO Reference Reagent for immunoassay of hCG beta subunit, with an assigned content of 0.88nmol/ampoule) (18). The former preparation was assigned a value based on bioassay, whereas the latter preparation had been extensively characterized by physicochemical and\n  immunological methods and calibrated in nanomol by amino acid analysis. Applying these considerations of the properties of biological analytes, and their measurement in the clinical situation allowed the WHO biological reference standard for hepatitis B surface antigen, assigned a value in arbitrary IU rather than in SI units, to be adopted by the medical devices sector of the European Commission as the standard required for the fulfilment of the so-called Common Technical Specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic devices. The Common Technical Specification document supporting the European (IVD) Medical Devices Directive 98/79 EC is a legally binding document within the 25 countries of the European Union.\n  Where it is appropriate for a WHO biological reference standard to be calibrated in SI units, the principles outlined in ISO 17511 (8) should be followed. This will necessitate the existence and use of an appropriate single reference method and an assignment of uncertainty, derived from calibration data. Such a reference method should not be a biological assay because the factors that affect the results of such assays are not fully understood. Where they are used, SI units assigned to biological reference standards should be derived from, and traceable to, physicochemical procedures.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note that IU are <strong>not<\/strong> the same as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_unit\" rel=\"nofollow\">enzyme units<\/a> (U) which is a measure of enzymatic activity<\/p>\n","answer_id":2815,"question_id":2813,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2813/what-is-the-miu-unit-as-used-in-hcg-hormone-levels","migrated_from":{"other_site":{"icon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/parenting/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"parents, grandparents, nannies and others with a parenting role","favicon_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/parenting/img/favicon.ico","site_type":"main_site","logo_url":"http://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/parenting/img/logo.png","api_site_parameter":"parenting","open_beta_date":1301961600,"site_state":"open_beta","related_sites":[{"site_url":"http://meta.parenting.stackexchange.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.parenting","name":"Parenting Meta Stack Exchange","relation":"meta"},{"site_url":"http://chat.stackexchange.com?tab=site&host=parenting.stackexchange.com","name":"Chat Stack Exchange","relation":"chat"}],"closed_beta_date":1301356800,"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#FFF","link_color":"#0077CC","tag_foreground_color":"#000"},"site_url":"http://parenting.stackexchange.com","name":"Parenting","twitter_account":"StackParenting"},"on_date":1341324051,"question_id":5450},"last_activity_date":1447781430,"creation_date":1341312603,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the mIU unit as used in hCG hormone levels?","body":"<p>My girlfriend is in her very early pregnancy, and has provided several blood samples by now where the doctors measure her hCG levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hCG hormone level is measure in a unit called <code>mIU/ml<\/code> which I figure is milli-something per milliliter blood.

You don't have \"your DNA\", you have a few billion copies of your DNA, one for each cell <sup>1<\/sup>. Within an individual, there are events (called mutagenic) which can change the DNA in an individual cell. The change is practically random. It is like having a pile of DVDs and tossing them around, so some of them get scratched a bit. If one event hits many cells at once (for example a strong dose of ionising radiation), the cells will likely get different mutations each. <strong>There is no event during adulthood which will lead to having the same mutation across all DNA copies of an adult organism<\/strong>. <sup>2<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>A second point: most events which change something in our body don't change a single copy of our DNA. Amputation of a limb is such an event.

Thus the child of two people with amputations will be born with all limbs present. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If two humans experience a mutagenic event in their adulthood, it will change the DNA in a very small part of their cells. If they get a melanoma due to UV damage, it's only the DNA in the tumor cells that's different (and probably the DNA in other skin cells which got changed, but not enough to turn them into tumor cells). The DNA copies in the rest of their body, including the DNA of their egg cells and sperm cells, stays the same. Therefore, their child is born without a melanoma. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If two people were born with the same mutation which causes a visible symptom like a missing limb, their child will be born with it too, and will also be limbless. In this case, parents and child have the exact same mutation in all cells throughout their bodies. This is however not due to an event which \"changed their DNA over time\".

Thus, assuming an average viral genome size\n  of 10^4 bp, the total length of viral DNA if all chromosomes were\n  linearized and placed end to end is ~10^22 km.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The estimated global number of prokaryotic cells is ~10^30 (Whitman et\n  al. 1998), and assuming an average prokaryotic genome size of 3x10^6\n  bp yields an estimated total DNA length of 10^24 km.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>With a total population size of 6x10^9 individuals, 10^13 cells per\n  individual (Baserga 1985), and a diploid genome size of 6x10^9 bp, the\n  amount of DNA occupied by the human population is ~10^20 km.  Assuming\n  there are ~10^7 species of eukaryotes on Earth (~6 times the number\n  that have actually been identified), that the average eukaryotic\n  genome size is ~1% of humans, and that all species occupy\n  approximately the same amount of total biomass, total eukaryotic DNA\n  is ~10^5 times that for humans, or ~10^25 km.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Given the very approximate nature of these calculations, any one of\n  these estimates could be off by one or two orders of magnitude, but it\n  is difficult to escape the conclusion that the total amount of DNA in\n  living organisms is on the order of 10^25 km, which is equivalent to a\n  distance of 10^12 light years, or 10 times the diameter of the known\n  universe.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":3329,"question_id":3327,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1346016785},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf11af111cab6e513d68e5e30762deb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6598,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6598/evgeni-sergeev","reputation":221,"display_name":"Evgeni Sergeev"},"score":12,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f55330b6dda706e76732866182751ce0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17041,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17041/lone-coder","reputation":101,"display_name":"Lone Coder"},"score":0,"post_id":20833,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438229638,"comment_id":60651,"body":"That paper is behind a pay wall.

A fun example also are the large dinosaurs that are thought to be homeotherms because their metabolism produce some heat and they are so large that they remain warm thanks to this heat source. However, they were probably not able to regulate actively their temperature. Therefore, I would tend to qualify dinosaurs as homeo-exo-therm but I wouldn't be surprised if someone prefers to call large dinosaur homeo-endo-therm individuals.

The concept of lineage is much more helpful. IMO, the only usefulness of this poorly defined concept that is the \"species\" is to have a common vocabulary for naming lineages.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Long answer<\/h1>\n\n<p><strong>Short history of the concept of species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge, the concept of species has first been used in the antiquity. At this time, most people viewed species as a fixed entity, unable to change through time (see <a href=\"http://amazingdiscoveries.org/C-deception-evolution_Plato_Darwin\">Aristotle and Plato's thoughts<\/a>). For some reason we stuck to this concept even though it sometimes appears to not be very useful.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Several definitions of species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As said above, the definition that you are suggesting doesn't apply to asexual species. There are several definitions of species that yield me once again to argue that we should rather forget about this concept and just use the term lineage and use accurate description of the reproductive barriers or genetic/functional divergence between lineage rather than using this made-up word that is \"species\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems with the definition you cite<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms where two hybrids are capable of reproducing fertile offspring, typically using sexual reproduction. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>In practice<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In general, everybody refers to this definition when talking about sexual lineages but nobody is correctly applying for practical reasons of communicating effectively.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>How low the fitness of the hybrids need to be?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>One has to arbitrarily define a limit of the minimal fitness (or maximal outbreeding depression) to get an accurate definition. Such boundary can be defined in absolute terms or in relative terms (relative to the fitness of the \"parent lineages\"). If, the hybrid has a fitness that is 100 times lower than any of the two parent lineages, then would you consider the two parent lineages to belong to the same species?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Type of reproductive isolation<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>We generally categorize the types of reproductive isolation into post-zygotic and pre-zygotic reproductive isolation (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_isolation\">wiki<\/a>). There is a lot to say on this subject but let's just focus to two interesting hypothetical cases:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Let's consider two lineages of birds. One lineage has blue feathers while the other has red feathers. They absolutely never interbreed because the blue birds don't like the red and the red birds don't like the blue. But if you artificially fuse their gametes, then you get a viable and fertile offspring. Are they of the same species?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Let's imagine we have two lineages of mosquitoes living in the same geographic region. One flying between 6pm and 8pm while the other is flying between 1am and 3am. They never see each other. But if they were to meet while flying they would mate together and have viable and fertile offsprings. Are they of the same species?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Under what condition is the hybrids survival and fertility measured<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Modern biology can do great stuff! Does it count if the hybrid can't develop in the mother's uterus (let's assume we are talking about mammals) but can develop in some other environment and then become a healthy adult?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Ring species<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>As you said in your question, ring species is another good example as why the concept of species is not very helpful (see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11240/transitivity-of-species-definitions\">this post<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Practical issue - Renaming lineages<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>How boring it would be if every time we discover the two species can in some circumstances interbreed, we had to rename them! That would be a mess.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Special cases<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>When considering a few special cases, the concept of species become even harder to apply. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Amazon molly<\/strong> (a fish) is a \"species\" that have \"sexual reproduction\" but there are no males! How is it possible? The females have to seek for sperm in a sister species in order to activate the development of the eggs but the genes of the father from the sister species are not used. (see <a href=\"http://classic.rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/817.short\">this article<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>In an ant \"species\", males and females can both reproduce by parthenogenesis (some kind of cloning but with meiosis and cross-over) and don't need each other to reproduce. In this respect males could actually be called females. But they still meet to reproduce together. The offsprings of a male and a female (via sexual reproduction) are sterile workers. So males and females are just like two sister species that reproduce sexually to create an army to protect and feed them. See more information in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7046/abs/nature03705.html\">this paper<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Bias<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It sometimes bring fame to discover a large new species. In consequence, scientists might do so even without really knowing if their lineages can interbreed with some other lineage or not. A typical example of such eventual bias concern dinosaurs (see this <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner_shape_shifting_dinosaurs?language=en\">TED<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So why do we still use the concept of species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Naming<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>IMO, its only usefulness is that it allows us to name lineages. And it is very important that we have the appropriate vocabulary to name different lineages even if this bring us to make a few mistakes and use some bad definitions.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>The alternative use of the concept of lineage<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It is important though that we are aware that the concept of species is poorly defined and that if we need to be accurate that we can talk in terms of lineages. The main issue with the term lineage is not semantic and comes about the fact that gene lineages may well differ considerably from what one would consider being the \"species lineage\" as defined by the \"lineages of most sequences\"... but this is a story for another time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In consequence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In consequence to the above issues, we often call two lineages that can interbreed to some extend by different species names. On the other hand two lineages that can hardly interbreed are sometimes called by the same species name but I expect this case to be rarer (as discussed by @DarrelHoffman and @AMR in the comments below).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Homo lineages<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I hope it makes sense from the above that the question is really not related to the special case of the interbreeding between the <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> and the <em>Homo neanderthalis<\/em> lineages.

Human eyes indeed have the highest <em>relative<\/em> amount of visibly exposed white sclera. The amount of visible sclera provides information about the orientation of the eyeball. Specifically, the iris-to-sclera ratio is an important cue for <strong>eye gaze<\/strong> perception <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863960/\">(Schulze <em>et al<\/em>., 2013)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Eye gaze is important<\/strong>. Most mammals generally interpret direct gaze as <strong>threatening<\/strong>, or as a sign of <strong>dominance<\/strong>. Humans, in contrast, tend to associate mutual gaze with <strong>positive interest, love and attraction<\/strong>. A preference for direct gaze seems to be present at a very early age. Infants as young as 2 days old prefer to look at faces that gazed directly at them, than to faces with averted gaze. Yet, humans sometimes find eye contact uncomfortable, for example if a stranger keeps staring at them <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863960/\">(Schulze <em>et al<\/em>., 2013)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ability to detect gaze has been established in <strong>many primate species<\/strong>, other than humans. Gaze detection may have evolved because direct gaze can signal that a <strong>predator<\/strong> is attending, making its detection an important tool for survival. Many animal species respond to the presence of staring eyes with displays of fear and submission, indicating that such stimuli act as <strong>warning signal<\/strong>. In humans, prolonged eye contact can also be perceived as an aggressive approach signal, as it leads to increases in galvanic skin response <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950440/pdf/nihms-719.pdf\">(Frischen <em>et al<\/em>., 2007)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_eye_hypothesis\"><strong>cooperative eye hypothesis<\/strong><\/a> assumes that the large scleral surface in humans developed especially for gaze detection <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RhKSm.jpg\">(Tomasello <em>et al<\/em>., 2007)<\/a>. The authors base this conclusion on the fact that human infants mainly followed gaze, while several species of great apes (including gorillas and bonobos, but not macaques) mainly followed head movements.  <\/p>\n\n<p>However, from my humble opinion, concluding that humans <em>developed<\/em> a large relative surface of white sclera for communication purposes is kind of far-stretched. For one thing, <strong>macaques also have quite a large white scleral surface<\/strong> (Fig. 1.) and macaques share a <strong>dedicated neural circuit with humans that involves the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_temporal_sulcus\">superior temporal sulcus<\/a> (STS)<\/strong>. The STS is thought to process biological motion, including gaze. The STS projects to the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/amygdala.htm\">amygdala<\/a>, a structure of the <a href=\"https://www.dartmouth.edu/~rswenson/NeuroSci/chapter_9.html\">limbic system<\/a> that implicated in the processing of the emotional content of stimuli, including facial expressions and gaze detection. It links this information to emotional responses in the observer. There are also connections between STS and the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1571496/\">intraparietal sulcus<\/a>, an area that is associated with spatial processing and shifts of attention. Via these connections, information about eye-gaze direction could project to spatial attention systems to initiate orienting of attention in the corresponding direction, as in joint attention. Indeed, passive viewing of a face with averted gaze elicits a stronger response in the IPS than viewing a face with direct gaze <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950440/pdf/nihms-719.pdf\">(Frischen <em>et al<\/em>., 2007)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jn7Q5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jn7Q5.jpg\" alt=\"![macaque\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

There are in fact several ways of feeding electrons into the respiratory chain. They all begin with one enzyme <em>E<\/em> that oxidizes an electron carrier in the mitochondrial matrix, such as NADH, FADH2, or ETF (electron transfer flavoprotein) and transfers electrons to coenzyme Q, which is then processed by Complex III, after which electrons are handed on to Complex IV. Both complex III and IV pump protons. But there are several options for the first enzyme <em>E<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase). This handles all electrons from NADH (from many sources in oxidative metabolism) and is typically the major source of electrons in the chain. It is the only enzyme <em>E<\/em> that also pumps protons itself.<\/li>\n<li>Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) accepts electrons from succinate (a step in the TCA cycle).<\/li>\n<li>ETF dehydrogenase accepts electrons from reduced ETF, notably from fatty acid oxidation.<\/li>\n<li>Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase accepts electrons from cytosolic NADH (from glycolysis) via the glycorol-3-phosphate shuttle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are more alternatives, but I think these are the most important ones.

(I don't have the energy to draw this :)<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the proton pumping at Complex III, it is not the case that the H$^+$ pumped are exactly those derived from NADH --- the system is more complicated than that. The respiratory chain(s) convert chemical energy from the redox reactions into potential energy (a proton gradient), but most of the H$^+$ pumped are obtained from the mitochondrial matrix. The exact number of protons varies depending on the substrate: for example, the 2 electrons donated by NADH at Complex I is sufficient to pump up to 10 protons. Actually, the stoichiometry is not fully understood, and there isn't really an exact integer number of H+ pumped, because this pumping is an imperfect physical process --- there is leakage, protins slipping back into the matrix etc.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40638,"question_id":40625,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40625/why-does-oxidative-phosphorylation-require-complexes-2-and-3","last_activity_date":1447597336,"creation_date":1447547561,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why does oxidative phosphorylation require complexes 2 and 3?","body":"<p>I am learning about oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration now and do not understand the roles of complexes 2 and 3 in the process.

Jaynes' paper <a href=\"ftp://129.240.33.108/pub/outgoing/IMN/Prediction%20modelling%20artikler%20fra%20Anders%20K%20W/Jaynes%201982,%20On%20the%20rational%20of%20Maximum-Entropy%20models.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"On the Rationale of Maximum-Entropy Methods\" (IEEE, 1982)<\/a> useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those generally interested in the broader applications of information theoretic methods to biology will likely appreciate some of the work that came out of last year's <a href=\"http://boffosocko.com/2015/05/20/videos-from-nimbios-workshop-on-information-and-entropy-in-biological-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NIMBioS Workshop on Information and Entropy in Biological Systems<\/a> (which Harte both attended and presented at), the <a href=\"http://www.birs.ca/events/2014/5-day-workshops/14w5170\" rel=\"nofollow\">BIRS Workshop Biological and Bio-Inspired Information Theory<\/a>, and the 2014 <a href=\"http://www.cecam.org/workshop-1014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CECAM Entropy in Biomolecular Systems<\/a>. The NIMBios Workshop was organized by John Baez, a physicist, who has worked with MaxEnt methods and explored them on his blog \"<a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/?s=maximum%20entropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azimuth<\/a>\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Those with a more sophisticated mathematical background (including measure theory, functional analysis, etc.) may appreciate Henryk Gzyl's text <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1MFrrIC\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Method of Maximum Entropy (World Scientific: Series on Advances in Mathematics for Applied Sciences, Vol 29, 1995)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>-- Additional thoughts after the question was edited -- <\/p>\n\n<p>First for those who don't have the background, I highly recommend reading the two seminal papers on information theory and statistical mechanics by ET Jaynes and the standard text on information theory <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1NThEjd\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elements of Information Theory<\/a><\/em> by Thomas M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the information theoretic related areas, you might want to take a look at the discipline of complexity theory, which has primarily grown out of the Santa Fe Institute over the past several decades and which includes information theory as part of its disciplines. If you're unfamiliar with the broader topic, Melanie Mitchell has an excellent overview with her book <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1YbcUZ4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Complexity: A Guided Tour<\/a><\/em>. Also related to complexity is the area of cellular automata which one could view as a very base model of more complex ecological systems. Here, perhaps Stephen Wolfram's <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1kwIAtM\" rel=\"nofollow\">A New Kind of Science<\/a><\/em> or <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Ybd3Me\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cellular Automata and Complexity<\/a><\/em> will be enlightening. The broader theories coming out of these primarily mathematical areas may be useful to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>In particular, given the types of models in ecosystems, I might suggest taking a look at some of the mathematical modeling going on at the intersection of complexity and economics. For a relatively simple introduction to this area, one could look at the relatively introductory text <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1kwJ6Ic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Complexity and the Economy<\/a><\/em> by W. Brian Arthur which is very interesting. The economy is essentially a very specific type of ecology dealing with human beings, assets, and the monetary system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another area which I've seen a lot of literature over the last few years is applicable to the ideas of resiliency and complexity in cities, for assisting in designing more robust city planning. This really isn't that far from the naturally evolving systems being looked at in ecology settings.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those looking for researchers in the area of complexity, I have a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/lists/complexity/members\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of many who are on twitter<\/a> in a variety of sub-areas. In addition to individuals, it also includes a number of institutes and related organizations as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd also suggest, that for the broadest theoretical setting, one could actually start with the topic known as \"Big History\" which takes the broadest approach of looking at history and the evolution of the cosmos over 13.7 billion years since the big bang. This conceptualization includes ideas like evolution, complexity, and emergence on the biggest scales, a set of theories that could be similarly applied to ecologies both large and small. For this viewpoint, I would suggest two works by David Christian including <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1kwJPJy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History<\/a><\/em> and <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1YbdExx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In essence, with many of these topics and viewpoints, one is treating individual animals or even entire species as elementary particles and then using the mathematical models of statistical thermodynamics to tease out specific types of data or trends. As layers of overlapping \"particles\" interact with each other, they cause emergent types properties, and then these resultant emergent properties combine to create further layers of emergent properties, none of which might have been necessarily deduced from the initial conditions. Within Big History, these types of emergence go from the big bang and basic particles in the early universe to the ultimate evolution of humankind by way of a variety of stages.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40555,"question_id":40532,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1447544993}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40532/are-there-any-theories-using-thermodynamics-statistical-mechanics-or-information","last_activity_date":1447547216,"creation_date":1447327924,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there any theories using thermodynamics/statistical mechanics or information theory principles to modelling in ecology?","body":"<p>So far, I've only known one: the MaxEnt theory.

Of course large predators are more prone to extinction because of lower numbers, but they usually exist in lower densities than prey (look, for instance, Lotka-Volterra equations and graphics, and also biomass and food pyramids).
