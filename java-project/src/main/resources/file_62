Given time, any living organism will be favored if a mutation involving a <strong>selective pressure<\/strong> (like an antibiotic) is introduced, not only in those towards which the antibiotic is directed but also among the normal microbiota. The longer the selective pressure (antibiotic treatment), the greater the probability that a resistant strain of one bacteria or another will develop. <\/p>\n\n<p>That's why there's a push (in studies) to limit the number of days of antibiotic use necessary to the least number needed which still proves efficient in eradicating an infection. (The trend is towards kill 'em quick and kill 'em all - higher doses for shorter periods, or make it strong and only long enough to cause the extinction of the illness-causing bacteria and not long enough for selection of resistance mutations.)<\/p>\n\n<p>It is quite normal to have potentially pathogenic bacteria as part of one's microbiome. Usually other beneficial bacteria and conditions keep these in check. But antibiotic resistance, once selected for, can persist for longer periods of time than previously recognized (up to four years in one study). This gives even a small population of resistant bacteria to genetically transfer resistance to others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Short-term use is less likely to select for resistance in one individual, but, in terms of populations of people, antibiotics are used so ubiquitously that resistant strains will be selected for in shorter treatment intervals by sheer numbers of people being treated.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When resistant and susceptible organisms compete to colonize or infect hosts, and use of an antibiotic has a greater impact on the transmission of susceptible bacteria than resistant ones, then increasing use of the antibiotic will result in an increase in frequency of organisms resistant to that drug in the population, even if the risk for treated patients is modest. Antimicrobial use and patient-to-patient transmission are not independent pathways for promoting of antimicrobial resistance, rather they are inextricably linked. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Long term use\" in one individual is relatively uncommon and unnecessary, but if necessary, usually does more good than harm <em>to that individual<\/em>. Almost all (if not all) of the population of the bacteria you're trying to eliminate from one site will be susceptible to the antibiotic and will die, leaving, in a few cases, a few resistant ones that your body can handle naturally, or that can repopulate to \"normal\" levels without causing illness. But they are then there, the resistant ones, to spread within a population of the individual's microbiome, and the population of people. The next person with a problem, who might have picked up that resistant strain, will not respond well to the same antibiotic. Nor will the patient who was initially treated, if the problem recurs with an antibiotic resistant strain. So, as I said, yes and no.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's why people (doctors, vets, and - with help - patients) should consider a risk-to-benefit-ratio whenever using an antibiotic. From that standpoint, it is always unethical to use an antibiotic for what is probably a virus, because the benefit to a patient is very small, but the risk - to that patient, who might suffer complications from its use, and to the population if a resistant strain is selected for - is relatively high. Better to wait it out to see if it is bacterial (if one can't test for it directly), and treat it if it does turn out to be. Of course, the risk of not treating in certain populations must also be considered: the elderly, the immunosuppressed, infants, and people with other illnesses or predispositions to infection.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's not just use of antibiotics in patients/humans that causes problems; its use in <em>any situation<\/em> can lead to selection for resistance. This is well documented to occur in the meat industry, where a grower often tries to minimize the effect of cost-efficient but insalubrious growing conditions by giving antibiotics to the entire population of meat-animals (beef or poultry) to cut the monetary losses associated with <em>potential<\/em> illnesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's a multifactorial, and often monetarily driven, problem. Doctors share the blame, but so do patients who demand antibiotics thinking they know better than the doctor, and who will doctor-shop until they find one who will do their bidding, or make a stink for the doctor who refuses. Some doctors still refuse, but they pay a heavy (non-monetary and sometimes monetary) price for doing so.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meat industry, it's always a monetarily driven process.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This review focuses on agricultural antimicrobial drug use as a major driver of antimicrobial resistance worldwide for four reasons: It is the largest use of antimicrobials worldwide; much of the use of antimicrobials in agriculture results in subtherapeutic exposures of bacteria; drugs of every important clinical class are utilized in agriculture; and human populations are exposed to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens via consumption of animal products as well as through widespread release into the environment.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><sub><strong>What YOU can do:<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub>Do not take an antibiotic for a viral infection like a cold or the flu.<\/sub><br>\n<sub>Do not save some of your antibiotic for the next time you get sick.<\/sub><br>\n<sub>Take an antibiotic exactly as the healthcare provider tells you.

I am happy to hear of another interpretation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>First, the overall goal of <a href=\"http://www.web-frog.com/pics/GoSM01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goles et al. (2001)<\/a> does not seem to test hypotheses related to the evolution of life cycles in the cicadas <em>per se<\/em>. It seems their overall goal instead may have been to explore the generation of prime numbers from numerical theory, using biologically-based models. For example, from the abstract they state,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The model marks an encounter of two seemingly unrelated disciplines: biology and number theory. A restriction to the latter, provides an evolutionary generator of arbitrarily large prime numbers.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and at the end of the discussion they write,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although there are traditional methods for prime number detection (see e.g., Ref. 23) that are faster than the methods presented here, it is remarkable that the generation of prime numbers can be performed using a biological model.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To more directly address your question and if I understand their models, Goles et al. (2001) do seem to allow the the life cycles of both predators and prey to co-evolve yet this is not always clear. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We compare now a prey mutating to a cycle Y' with the resident prey (cycle length Y ) at <em>constant<\/em> X. Analogously, we compare mutant cycles X' with resident cycles X at <em>constant<\/em> Y (Goles et al. 2001, pg. 34; emphasis added).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, they seem to be saying that the life cycle of one (predator or prey) can change while other other remains constant (prey or predator). The life cycles don't coevolve.  Subsequent formulas and statements imply an interactive effect between the predator <em>and<\/em> prey life cycles. (Honestly, their writing is somewhat opague to me and they do not define all of their mathematical terms, making it difficult to follow the logic of their models.) <\/p>\n\n<p>Regardless, the results of their initial models, shown in the figure below, shows the prey converging on a 17 year life cycle while the predators converge on a 4 year cycle. Somewhat more complex models tended to converge on 13 and 17 year cycles, although other primes like 11, 19 and 23, had similar probabilities of evolving.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mGnxc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Goles et al. (2001) admit at the outset of their paper that there is no evidence for predators with periodical cycles that align with the life cycles of cicadas. This would be consistent with general ecological observations. Most predators consume multiple prey items. Highly specialized predators would be more vulnerable to extinction if their prey source went extinct.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another numerical model, developed by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690011/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanaka et al. (2009)<\/a> explicitly to explore life cycle evolution of cicadas, does not include predator life cycles at all. Their results still converge on 13 and 17 year life cycles although they restricted the possible range of life cycles to between 10 and 20 years. Thus, it does not appear to be necessary for predators to evolve a life cycle that coincides with prey life cycles for the predator satiation hypothesis to work. Of course, this is consistent with the real world observations that cicadas do not appear to have predators with concommitant life cycles.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Original answer, lightly edited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strike>In the case of the cicadas, they are the prey, not the predators. They are not synchronizing their life cycles with the predators (if I am interpreting your entire question correctly).<\/strike> The argument is that cicadas have evolved synchronized life cycles to maximize survivorship.  By having a large number of individuals emerge within a very short period of time, the very high density means most individuals will live long enough to reproduce because the predators (birds, small rodents, etc.) will be satiated (see <a href=\"http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/projects/cicada/resources/reprints/Williams%26Simon_1995.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Williams and Simon 1995<\/a> for a review and pointers to early literature). Some predators of cicadas will be always present so the cicadas are not synchronizing to any specific predator.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.web-frog.com/pics/GoSM01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goles et al. (2001)<\/a> used numerical models to argue that such life cycles will tend to converge on prime numbers. (As discussed in the update above) <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690011/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanaka et al. (2009)<\/a> recently argued, again using numerical models, that the prime number-based life cycles of cicadas evolved as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/allee-effects-19699394\" rel=\"nofollow\">Allee effect<\/a>. The Allee effect basically states that there is a positive association between the fitness of individuals in the population and the population size or density. Below a certain size, a population is unable to sustain itself and is vulnerable to extinction. Tanaka et al. argue that the Allee effect results in prime-based life cycles under varying environmental parameters. They further argue that maintenance of alternate life cycles minimize hybridization between groups with different life cycle timings.<\/p>\n\n<p>What seems to really remain to understand the evolution of cicada life cycles is to unravel the genetic mechanisms involved with timing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature Cited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Goles, E. et al. 2001.

The population of this predator is distributed evenly across all the different stages of its life cycle, at least at first. <\/p>\n\n<p>One year there is a cicada eruption and all the members of this predator species are incredibly well-fed for a month or two. If the effects of this prey glut aren't perfectly evenly spread across all ages of the predator species, there will be a fitness advantage to one age group or another. Maybe the young ones grow faster, or the old ones spend more time looking for mates instead of eating. It doesn't matter which(it can even be both) as long as it's not even across all members of the predator species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now examine the next generation, five years down the line. The effects of the prey glut are felt here too (more parents-> more children, bigger parents->stronger children, etc etc). If the cicada cycle is five years, or even ten, every predator generation(or every other generation) that coincides with the cicada eruption gets a fitness/population bump. After many iterations, the age group of predators that matures or spawns or whatever in time to get the maximal benefit from the cicada eruption dominates. Instead of evenly distributed age ranges, you get a big group of predator species that are synced up to benefit optimally from the cicada eruptions, which is bad news for the cicadas.<\/p>\n\n<p>The thing that regulates the predator life cycle length is the time to sexual maturity, or the generation time. If this is a factor of the cicada hibernation time, cycles develop and the cicadas are in trouble. If the cicadas use a large prime number, the number of cicada generations between matching predator generations is very large. (a five year predator cycle and 17 year cicada cycle only overlap once every 85 years.) For every predator generation that benefits optimally from the cycle, 17 of them have to live without the benefit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking taking a long time to reach sexual maturity is bad news for a predator species(all other things being equal), so no species to my knowledge has evolved to sync up its generations with the cicadas. <\/p>\n","answer_id":20872,"question_id":20869,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1411467792}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20869/premise-of-life-cycle-synchronization-between-predator-and-prey","last_activity_date":1423225674,"creation_date":1409325097,"answer_count":2,"title":"Premise of life cycle synchronization between predator and prey","body":"<p>While reading about the predator satiation hypothesis of the periodical cicadas' 13/17 year life cycles, I started wondering about its premise.

If you simulate such systems you'll see that the population sizes of the two species fluctuate like this:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRImS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where the blue line represents the predators and the red line represents the preys.<\/p>\n\n<p>Representing the same data in phase space, meaning with the population size of the two species on axes $x$ and $y$ you get:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yidcV.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>where the arrows shows the direction toward which the system moves.

Why don't preys evolve in order to escape predators so that the population of predators crushes?<\/p>\n\n<p>As showed, you don't need a complex model to allow the co-existence of predators and preys. You could describe your model a bit more accurately in another post and ask why in your model the preys  always get extinct. But there are tons of possibilities to render you model more realistic such as adding spatial heterogeneities (places to hide for example as suggested by Audrius Meškauskas). One can also other trophic levels, stochastic effects, varying selection pressure through time, age- or sex-specific mortality rate due to predation etc..<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I would also like to talk about other things that might be of interest in your model (two of them need you to allow evolutionary processes in your model):<\/p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>lineage selection<\/strong>: predators that eat too much end up disappearing because they caused their preys to get extinct. This hypothesis has nothing to do with some kind of auto-regulation for the good of species. Of course you'd need several species of predators and preys in your model. This kind of hypothesis are usually considered as very unlikely to have any explanatory power.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Life-dinner principle<\/strong>. While the wolf runs for its dinner, the rabbit runs for its life. Therefore, there is higher selection pressure on the rabbits which yield the rabbits to run in average slightly faster than wolves. This evolutionary process protects the rabbits from extinction.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) You may consider..<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>more than one species of preys or predators<\/li>\n<li>environmental heterogeneity<\/li>\n<li>partial overlapping of distribution ranges between predators and preys<\/li>\n<li>When one species is absent, the model behave just like an exponential model. You might want to make a model of logistic growth for each species by including $K_x$ and $K_y$ the carrying capacity for each species.<\/li>\n<li><p>Adding a predator (or parasite) to the predator species of interest<\/p>\n\n<p>... and you might get very different results.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":15516,"question_id":15514,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1423192025},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gNHmR.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5924,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5924/h22","reputation":219,"display_name":"h22"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f23444a71ffb8e6b5930b59e1eed15c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5917,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5917/nerrolken","reputation":327,"display_name":"Nerrolken"},"score":0,"post_id":15681,"edited":false,"creation_date":1394688345,"comment_id":21150,"body":"An excellent notion!"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1394700822,"creation_date":1394627779,"body":"<p>One of the possible adjustments of these mathematical models is to introduce a \"place to hide\", making some (small) percent of the prey population not accessible (or much more difficult to access) for predators.

If we eat from the most desirable on the right the rapid quality (but not the virility) reduction of the prey population has serious negative health consequences for the predators.

It was very simplified (each animal had simple attack/defense/speed/stealth values, etc), but something became rapidly apparent: in every simulation the predators overwhelmed the prey, reproducing until their numbers could not be sustained by the herbivores, and leading to an inevitable die-off of both groups.

Evolution will and does continue.  Mass extinctions have happened in the past and <a href=\"http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/intelligence.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">in fact we are the product and beneficiaries of that process<\/a>; when niches open up from extinctions, other species just move in and take over, eventually they will adapt to take the place of those who have left.  Of course that's a useful perspective since it <em>will<\/em> happen.  A large number of animals and plants are endangered and while the impact overall can't be estimated since we have never counted all the animals and plants, much less microscopic species, an example of our dire straits can be gleaned from the fact that perhaps <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=amphibian-ark\" rel=\"nofollow\">half of amphibians are endangered<\/a>, <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.earthwatch.org/aboutus/research/voices_of_science/future_life_interview_e_wilson/\" rel=\"nofollow\">There are various arguments that there is lost knowledge<\/a> - when these animals and plants we have never even cataloged disappear we will lose hundreds of millions of years of biological 'experience', of lost knowledge as well as an aesthetic/ethical argument that this is clearly wrong somehow; like a mass murder of animals and plants. <\/p>\n\n<p>I think that most people who have never seen these animals and plants, understood how wonderful and awe-inspiring they are, how many odd abilities that evolution has gifted them.  It seems like a nearly universal experience that those who have seen this are pretty strongly in favor of efforts to save them. <\/p>\n\n<p>But that's not the question at hand; really won't the ecosphere heal and eventually be okay?  Now that we have discovered life so far under the ocean and in the depths of the earth that even nuclear holocaust would probably not touch them.  The answer is yes.  The ecosphere and life will go on.  There are two other useful questions though:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) will we go on with it? Mass extinctions are the result of changes in the environment - all living things in that environment will sink or swim as it were and humans should not exclude ourselves.  Will the future human race deal with loss of oxygen content, the loss of fresh water and the misery of population explosion?  If the environment just keeps getting worse, will we do well?  We're all assuming that we will figure out how to feed ourselves, find drinking water when both food and water are not really growing to meet our growing population, not to mention the desertification of arable land and the rise in temperature that will impact human geography and economics over the next 100 years or so.  If the environment were to stabilize at least we would not be standing on shifting ground. If you are familiar with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malthus' argument<\/a>, when there is no food or land left to exploit nature will take its course with us - war, famine etc etc.  That is also a natural state, which we've managed to slowly eliminate.  We may be bringing it back in.    <\/p>\n\n<p>2) How long do we want to wait for the ecosystem to heal? After the mass extinctions of the past, <em>hundreds of millions of years<\/em> were needed for the species around to re-establish themselves as they are now.  Is that really a good trade off for a few decades of industrial-economic expansion? <\/p>\n\n<p>Until then, the survivors are not necessarily the ones we'd prefer. <\/p>\n\n<p>I volunteered at a survey of shellfish in the San Franscisco Bay.  At one time the shellfish here were so plentiful that the natives piled giant shellmounds the size of small hills from their regular diets.  Now because of fertilizer runoff and pollution these shellfish are nearly gone - we didn't see one the entire day looking around the survey area.  Instead they nesting shells were covered with a slimy bunch of sea squirts -  plant-like animals which can grow quickly enough to absorb the nutrients and robust enough to ignore the pollution and chemicals.  I'd probably rather have a bay scallops on my plate rather than a salad of seq squirts.  The Bay is swimmable, but is plenty slimy.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Got to sign off now, but that's the outline of an answer...<\/p>\n","answer_id":8366,"question_id":8355,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ac71c8033f4b2b7d9f8ccc679bbea5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":146,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/146/dale","reputation":707,"display_name":"Dale","accept_rate":33},"score":0,"post_id":8548,"edited":false,"creation_date":1369672247,"comment_id":10905,"body":"In the first paragraph you portray extinction due to invasive species as illegitimate.

Also, evolution is not 'supposed' to do anything, and can lead to both an increase or a decrease in diversity, since (local) diversity is simply the net result of speciation rate and extinction rate (if we exclude colonization of new species from other areas). Therefore, I think the question is framed in the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, there are many reasons why biologists might want to halt species extinctions, as hinted in the other comments and answers. Most obviously, conservation biologists want to prevent man-made extinctions which are due to how we have influenced/modified/destroyed the natural environments. I don't think conservation biologists in general are determined to halt all 'natural' extinction. However, most of the time it is really hard to pinpoint what would be a 'natural' extinction. Either way, the current rates of extinction, which have been estimated to lie 100-1000 times (<a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/news/?81/Extinction-crisis-escalates-Red-List-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-in-danger\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"IUCN. 2007.

Three distinct categories are:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) For human survival and/or economy, e.g. through ecosystem services or resources we rely on.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) For human welfare, e.g. recreation or esthetical reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Ethical considerations, e.g. inherent value of species or to preserve the unique evolutionary history of the system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another way to structure these is to label 1) &amp; 2) as instrumental values and 3) as inherent values. The instrumental values can then be subcategorized as services, goods/resources, information (e.g. genetic to be used in medical research), and esthetical/spiritual values.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the direct value of individual species are often (usually) uncertain (irrespectivly of the direct rationales used) the precautionary principle is often invoked to justify species conservation. Also, numerous examples exist of how aspects of biodiversity are related to human values (some recent examples are <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6127/1608.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Garibaldi et al. 2013.

The Fossil Record of Predation<\/a>) - see fig 19b - and, if so, is specifically dealing with marine predators.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't have time to look at that paper closely (it is quite long), and paleoecology is not my field, but a couple of relevant sections are:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, the diversity of predators and the proportion\n  of total faunal diversity composed of predators have both increased over time, implying that ecosystems have\n  increased their ability to support either more predators or more specialization among predators. Also, turnover\n  in diversity dominance among predator groups, with more energetic predator taxa replacing or being added to a\n  fauna of less energetic groups, implies that the energy available in marine food webs has increased. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If\n  the efficiency of energy transfer between levels in\n  the food pyramid has stayed nearly constant (and\n  there is no evidence that it has not), then a reasonable\n  hypothesis for the increased proportional diversity\n  of predators is that either the biomass of prey species\n  has increased or the populations of prey taxa have\n  become more stable (or both), permitting greater\n  specialization by predators on more reliable food\n  supplies. Thus, predators could increase their\n  proportional share of total diversity by specializing\n  on fewer prey taxa.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to the author, energetics, energy flow and predator specialization seems like likely reasons for the change. However, the paper also discuss factors such as rates of fossilization and also the fact that predators are generally rarer than prey means that there is probably more stochasticity in the fossil occurence process, which could affect estimated turnover rates and maybe also the proportion between predator and prey. You'll have to look at the entire paper for a fuller picture, and maybe somebody more knowledgeable can fill in later. I also think that you need to look at radiation patterns in certain taxa to fully understand these stepwise changes, and also to consider oxygenetion events as possible underlying reasons, but these are just my speculations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reasons given above also in one sense echoes the \"<em>biotic<\/em>\" explanation for the latitudunal diversity gradient (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6783/full/405220a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Gaston. 2000.

So there might be interesting connections to contemporary patterns and processes of biodiversity as well. However, I haven't seen a compilation of %predators over different biomes or latitudes to match the graph in the question.

Here follows a partly quoted and partly adapted text from this article:<\/p>\n\n<p>First , because mass increases as the cube, but surface area as the square of linear dimensions, <strong>falling large animals are in general more injury-prone than small ones<\/strong>, as they suffer greater impact stress, their bones experience greater stress, and they reach higher terminal velocities in free-fall because of a less favorable area/mass ratio. While a small drop breaks an elephant's leg, a falling mouse reaches terminal velocity in the atmosphere much sooner and at a much lower value than do falling elephants. <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, falling cats have a <strong>superb vesti­bular system and make gyroscopic turns\nsuch that all four feet are soon pointing downwards<\/strong>, regardless of the cat's\norientation at the start of the fall. Hence cats dissipate the impact force over all four limbs. Falling human adults  tend to tumble uncontrollably but land most often\non two feet, next most often on their heads. These facts contribute to the low mortality of falling cats and to their low chance of breaking limbs after the fall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Third, a <strong>cat<\/strong> falling in the atmosphere reaches a terminal  velocity  of  about  <strong>60 m.p.h. (compared with 120 m.p.h. for adult humans<\/strong>) after only  about  100 feet. As long as it experiences acceleration, the cat probably extends its limbs reflexively , but on reaching terminal velocity it may relax and extend the limbs more horizontally in <strong>flying-squirrel fashion<\/strong>, thus not only <strong>reducing the velocity of fall<\/strong> but also <strong>absorbing the  impact  over  a greater  area of its body<\/strong>. This may explain the para­doxical decrease of mortality and injury in cats that fall more than 100 feet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, cats that land with their <strong>limbs flexed dissipate much of the impact force through soft tissue<\/strong>. Parachutists are trained to dissipate impact forces by landing with knees and hips flexed, then rolling.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988Natur.332..586D\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diamond. <em>Nature<\/em> 1988; <strong>332<\/strong>:586-7<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Further reading<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17492802\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC news<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YPjiX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":28292,"question_id":28285,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1423098978}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28285/how-do-cats-survive-falling-from-great-heights","last_activity_date":1423127242,"creation_date":1422956534,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do cats survive falling from great heights?","body":"<p>Among mammals, cats are able to land safely when falling from great heights.

It is perhaps not that 'housekeeping' genes - broadly expressed genes - are 'above the laws of regulation'; rather that their regulation is merely more straight-forward than that of specialised genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can think of 2 factors that could be relevant:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Abundance of methylation sites (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site\">CpG sites<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Promoter sequences and hence the transcription factors regulating expression of housekeeping genes are distinct from those controlling specialisation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I think the second (promoter sequences) is the better explanation, since housekeeping genes are abundant in CpG islands; but I'll explain a bit about both.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr:<\/strong> Housekeeping genes have simpler promoter and enhancer regions that are not bound by particular complexes which act to inactivate regions of the genome in a hierarchical manner during differentiation (according to the transcriptional program). <a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140\">http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h3>Preamble<\/h3>\n\n<p>In forming tissues during development, cells must differentiate from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell\">embryonic stem cells<\/a>, which have very wide potential to express many genes and give rise to all cell types; to partially specialised stem cells e.g. hematopoietic stem cells (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell\">HSCs<\/a>) which are limited to give rise to all blood cells but not, say, neurons or pancreas or skin. Completely differentiated cells have a much more restricted domain of possible expression, and are more-or-less condemned to their fate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Waddington's developmental landscape is a nice metaphor for how cells specialise:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lNEXk.jpg\" alt=\"Waddington&#39;s developmental landscape\"><\/p>\n\n<h3>DNA Methylation<\/h3>\n\n<p>A major mechanism behind this one-way narrowing of potential is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070\">methylation of DNA<\/a>, which suppresses transcription. As the ball rolls down the landscape it acquires new stretches of methylation on its DNA, rendering it inactive which (for our purposes) is <em>permanent and irreversible.<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>DNA methylation consolidates its chromatin inactivating function by acting as a signal for proteins which chemically modify <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone\">histones<\/a> (around which DNA is wrapped in chromatin) with further signals to condense chromatin, which occludes the transcriptional machinery from doing what it does best. (There are also activating histone modifications, and we imagine chromatin being, roughly, in OPEN and CLOSED states regarding the possibility of RNA polymerase gaining access to the DNA.) Since histones are ubiquitous &amp; regularly spaced over the genome, there aren't \"non-regulatable\" regions - chromatin is opened or closed by the interactions of various DNA binding proteins, some reading and writing signals on to the chromatin.<\/p>\n\n<p>So one plausible hypothesis is that <strong>housekeeping genes are relatively devoid of CpG sites<\/strong> (where methylation occurs). However I think this is <strong>not true<\/strong>. Many human genes have regions abundant in CpG (called 'islands') around their promoters, <a href=\"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1010.full\">and in particular virtually all housekeeping genes<\/a>. When genes are active, these CpG islands are unmethylated - hence in most tissues housekeeping genes have unmethylated CpG islands, something else is keeping them unmethylated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specialised cells, through a hierarchical transcriptional program of 'master regulators', successively close unneeded regions of their chromatin during differentiation, and keep open regions containing housekeeping genes, and the 'specialised genes' that relate to its specialism - these regulators are transcription factors which recognise the regions they act upon by binding promotor or enhancer sequences.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Housekeeping promoters and transcription factors<\/h3>\n\n<p>Transcription factors bind to enhancer or promoter sequences and open or close the chromatin for RNA polymerase, usually as part of a co-operative complex of many factors, including proteins that modify the histones or methylate DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good hypothesis is that the <strong>promoter/enhancer regions of housekeeping genes differ from those of specialised genes<\/strong> which are inactivated in many tissues. The transcriptional programs in differentiation must call forth factors that bind and inactivate specialised genes but keep active things like actin, ribosomal genes, <em>etc.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140\">This paper<\/a> finds that upstream regions of housekeeping genes are less conserved, and a particular set of promoter motifs are over-represented. This suggests that housekeeping genes have relatively simple regulation by a few transcription factors; they lack binding sites for those transcription factors with important specialised roles in development.<\/p>\n\n<p>To summarise, I think the following is likely: Housekeeping genes' promoter and enhancer regions exempt them from the complex transcriptional programs of hierarchical inactivation responsible for cell differentiation that many other genes are subject to. Housekeeping genes simply lack the relevant binding sites for these specialised transcription factors; they have instead more simple 'core' promoter elements. All the DNA methylation and opening/closing of the chromatin is a consequence of the transcriptional program. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070\">http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1010.full\">http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1010.full<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140\">http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140<\/a>   &lt; most relevant thing to read, and the basis of my own conclusion<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":28313,"question_id":28309,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1423057948}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28309/what-is-it-about-the-housekeeping-genes-that-makes-them-almost-immune-to-gene-re","last_activity_date":1423091531,"creation_date":1423045882,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is it about the housekeeping genes that makes them almost immune to gene regulation?","body":"<p>When it comes to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote\" rel=\"nofollow\">eukaryotes<\/a>, including ourselves, we have all different kinds of specialized cells and tissues that are so different, yet originally all came from the same single cell.

It appears that formation of this hairpin <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867401005827\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"destabilises the elongation complex [RNA polymerase + elongation factors]\"<\/a>, and is an irreversible step towards collapse of the transcription bubble and dissociation of the transcription machinery.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500804773\" rel=\"nofollow\">The polyU tract (~8nt long) proceeding the hairpin seems to have dual function<\/a>: the A:U basepairing in the DNA:RNA hybrid is weak; the hybrid becomes less favourable. Since the hairpin (which is an RNA:RNA duplex) is adjacent to the RNA:DNA hybrid duplex in the bubble, they experience competition for formation. Weakening the hybrid duplex favours hairpin formation, which acts like a switch that separates most of the RNA:DNA duplex in the bubble - synthesis cannot proceed, and the unstable complex dissociates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, the ployU seems to be responsible for pausing which allows time for the hairpin to form, but not for the reason you suggest:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00928361\" rel=\"nofollow\">The concentration of UTP in the cell is not unusually low<\/a>. ATP concentrations are higher than other ribonucleotides since it is the cell's major 'energy currency', quite apart from nucleic acid synthesis. Hence I don't believe pausing can be explained as the polymerase waiting for UTP. The polyU tract probably acts as a 'back-tracking signal' to the polymerase, since the hybrid duplex in the catalytic site is weakened, and the repeated nature may be \"slippery\"(?). <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412006940\" rel=\"nofollow\">This back-tracking pauses the polymerase.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XqqUU.jpg\" alt=\"Intrinsic termination, paused &amp; trapped states\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarise:<\/strong> The elongation complex passes the palindrome and reaches the polyU tract, where the hybrid duplex in the bubble is weak and tends to cause back-tracking/pausing. This allows time for the hairpin to form in the exit channel, which both unwinds the hybrid duplex further, and destabilises the elongation complex. The transcriptional machinery is now destined to dissociate and the bubble collapse: RNA is released from the DNA duplex.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that intrinsic termination can be suppressed by proteins that bind the hairpin. In bacterial operons, where sets of (almost) concatenated genes are separated by intrinsic termination signals, the amount of read-through at each termination site determines the relative expression levels of each gene.<\/p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1838574/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rho-dependent Termination<\/a><\/h3>\n\n<p>Rho is a hexameric protein complex that is loaded on to the nascent RNA at a loading sequence. It hydrolyses ATP to move along the emerging RNA - apparently it \"races\" with the polymerase, and when it catches up to the polymerase, it causes termination. There are pause sites in the RNA which allow rho to catch up - these sites tend to be rich in A and U, so perhaps polymerase is slowed by destabilisation of the hybrid duplex - but it is nothing like the intrinsic terminator, since it depends completely on rho for termination.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3bC1v.jpg\" alt=\"Rho-dependent termination process\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":28319,"question_id":28316,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1423072330}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28316/are-there-u-rich-transcriptional-pause-sites","last_activity_date":1423072330,"creation_date":1423063703,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are there U-rich transcriptional pause sites?","body":"<p>I've heard a statement in a talk that U-rich sequences cause transcriptional pausing. The intuitive explanation for this was that the UTP concentration is lower in the cell than the ATP concentration. Reducing the concentration of an educt obviously reduces the reaction rate, leading to pausing of the RNA polymerase.<\/p>\n\n<p>After reading up on transcriptional pausing, I haven't found any literature that shares this view. The recent papers I found don't show U-rich sequences and have completely different explanations on how pausing works. Those explanations mainly concern interactions at the edges of the transcription bubble.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, I guess that there might be multiple mechanisms of transcriptional pausing. But I couldn't find any references in the literature to U-rich pause sites and how they could work. Is there any literature on this? Either on the fact that U-rich sequences tend to be pause sites, or that the concentration difference in NTPs leads to pausing at certain sites.<\/p>\n","question_id":28316,"tags":["biochemistry","transcription","polymerase"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002211625446/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":9950,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9950/amruta-rajarajan","reputation":46,"display_name":"Amruta Rajarajan"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4B4y1.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6703/p-s-w-g","reputation":816,"display_name":"p.s.w.g","accept_rate":60},"score":1,"post_id":28317,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423076259,"comment_id":46408,"body":"Regarding the first question, probably because as long as the organism uses queues from it&#39;s environment (e.g. light levels / temperature / tides) it&#39;s rhythm doesn&#39;t need to be <i>exactly<\/i> 24 hours.

DNase I cleaves DNA in an <em>almost<\/em>-random manner and is inhibited by proteins covering ('protecting') the DNA backbone.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to locate a site which is protected from DNase I cleavage, we need to take some genomic DNA and treat it. We need separate, short lengths of DNA to examine - we can obtain these from genomic DNA by PCR amplification of different stretches. We need to label these amplicons at one end only, beta radiation is a good choice of label.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taking one labelled amplicon, exposing it to DNase I for a short time - not long enough for complete digestion - produces cleaved DNA of all possible lengths, which looks like a 'ladder' after separation by gel electrophoresis. Digestion time must be short, such that many DNA are only cleaved once, to have a complete ladder.\nRepeating this digestion with your interesting protein present gives a ladder with a missing segment. This is because your protein protects a length of DNA from cleavage.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YzeGX.gif\" alt=\"DNase footprinting diagram\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Important points: DNA is labelled at one end only. Hence we only see the label-end-piece of DNA after cleavage: if DNA is labelled 5' and cleaved in half, we only see 5' halves. Thanks to this, we can estimate the position of the binding site: if our DNA is 100bp and our ladder has lengths 0 to 70bp, a gap, then more from 85 to 100bp, then our binding site is somewhere inside 70-85bp from the labelled end. We can sequence the piece of DNA and read the sequence of nucleotides 70-85.<\/p>\n\n<h2>ChIP-seq<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is a more recently-developed method, which is more suited to studying where a protein binds all over the genome or all over a chromosome. It requires an antibody which specifically binds your interesting protein.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, a 'snap-shot' of global protein-DNA binding is taken by irradiating cells with UV light, causing covalent cross-links between DNA and binding proteins. Chromatin (DNA with associated proteins) is isolated from cells and chopped up to smaller fragments; the cross-links preserve our 'snap-shot' of proteins and short lengths of their bound DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>This mixture is incubated with an antibody (immobilised on beads) which binds our protein of interest. We can separate the antibody-covered beads and hence our protein along with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally we can sequence the DNA fragments caught in this way. It's like \"fishing for binding sequences\". The end result is a distribution of where our protein was bound across the genome at the time of our snap-shot.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1TrMz.png\" alt=\"ChIP-seq workflow diagram\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally the DNA fragments should be long enough to place them uniquely in the genome. There are advanced PCR and sequencing methods which separate DNA fragments in to 'bubbles' in an emulsion containing one molecule of DNA each. In this way, we can sequence all the variants that are present and by counting the number of sequences ('reads') of each type, we have a measure of the abundance of each sequence. This abundance is interpreted as the occupancy of the protein at different binding sites.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jpCBN.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of ChIP-seq output: distributions of a transcription complex and several histone modifications across a segment of a chromosome.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Genome-wide studies of DNA binding have shown us that proteins are distributed around the genome. They have preferred binding sites but also have some affinity for similar sites, and spend some of their time bound to non-functional bits of the genome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Especially in mammals, a 'true' binding site isn't only (and isn't always) determined by having the highest affinity sequence, but also by being clustered with binding sites for other co-factors. This is because, in mammals, proteins often bind DNA, not solo, but as parts of large complexes which can interact with nucleosomes and which allow regulation of transcription or whatever else.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question is how can we precisely tell at which sites they bind? Is it the amino acid sequence of the protein? Or is it the repetitiveness factor in case they bind to multiple locations on the chromosome?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So, we can tell at which sequences (and where in the genome, even with what relative occupancy) proteins will bind to DNA by experiment. You could try to guess where they bind from their structure, but the way we precisely tell, is by experiment.<\/p>\n\n<p>The amino acid sequence of a protein ultimately determines its folded structure, and there are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-binding_domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">many DNA-binding motifs<\/a> or domains which appear in many different proteins. Some motifs bind the DNA backbone regardless of the sequence of bases, others bind specific sequences.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's take zinc fingers as an example. The best-known class of zinc fingers basically inserts an alpha-helix in to the major groove of the DNA double helix, where certain amino acids on the appropriate side of the alpha-helix make contacts with the nucleotide bases. These contacts can be hydrogen bonds, or van-der-Waals contact. (E.g. Histidine and serine tend to hydrogen bond guanine; phenylalanine 'ring-stacks' between As and Ts; and threonine contacts the methyl group of thymine.)<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PKAv7m.png\" alt=\"Array of 3 zinc fingers with their &#39;reading helices&#39; in the major groove.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Zinc fingers are often found in arrays in proteins, as you might have been suggesting by \"repetitiveness factor\". Meaning, a single finger might recognise a specific 3 or 4bp sequence, which isn't very unique. A protein will usually have 3 or more fingers held with regular spacing, so that this string of motifs: ZFa-ZFa-ZFb might recognise the DNA sequence: GCTAxxxGCTAxxxCCAA which is a much more unique site (this is imaginary.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So yes protein sequence and (thus) structure determines what sites a protein can bind (you can imagine a distribution of affinity for sequences, there will be a 'peak' sequence) - but again some proteins bind the DNA backbone non-specifically, and in mammals they often don't bind alone but within complexes.<\/p>\n\n<p>People have studied protein-DNA binding by engineering their own arrays of zinc fingers or TALENs, and also by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_evolution_of_ligands_by_exponential_enrichment\" rel=\"nofollow\">engineering their own DNA binding sites<\/a>, through a process of 'artificial evolution': selecting the strongest binders, mutating them, and repeat. These kinds of studies might come up with a sort of optimal 'binding code'.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28261,"question_id":28257,"up_vote_count":16,"last_edit_date":1423058732}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28257/how-are-we-able-to-find-the-specific-sites-at-which-dna-binding-proteins-bind","last_activity_date":1423058732,"creation_date":1422876245,"answer_count":1,"title":"How are we able to find the specific sites at which DNA binding proteins bind?","body":"<p>We know that some DNA binding proteins are site specific, that is they recognise and bind to a specific nucleotide sequence.

'A SNP' refers to a location, given a name/identifier for the purpose of measuring variation with SNP-chips; necessarily the same location in any person, which may vary, but needn't always differ between everyone (come on, there are only 4 possible values). You should re-phrase your question \"why do they differ at SNP 1 and not at SNP2?\".<\/p>\n\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n\n<p>SNP means nothing more than 'a single basepair in the genome, that might vary in a population', so let's just talk of 'difference at a position'.<\/p>\n\n<p>A single haploid set of the human genome consists of 23 chromosomes, 22 of these are quite 'ordinary', while 1 is involved in sex determination.

For this reason, I do <em>not<\/em> think your question is asking 'how can 2 persons have a difference at basepair <em>x<\/em> on one copy of Chr1, and no difference on the other copy of Chr1' - because both copies of Chr1 are merged as one person's dataset. <\/p>\n\n<p>In fact it's impossible to assign (meaning to group in to <em>haplotypes<\/em>) heterozygous sequence to either one copy or the other without more information, i.e. sequences from parents &amp; grandparents, to see which variants are inherited together (are linked).<\/p>\n\n<h3>What I think your problem really is<\/h3>\n\n<p>I think you are asking 'how can 2 persons have a difference at basepair <em>x<\/em> on Chr1, and no difference at basepair <em>x<\/em> on Chr6 (say)?'\nThis is easily answered. Basepair 100 of Chr1 is a completely different and unrelated position in the genome to basepair 100 of Chr6. There is no reason to expect that these positions should be related. <\/p>\n\n<h3>A helpful thought experiment<\/h3>\n\n<p>We can concatenate the chromosomes rather than re-setting our count at the beginning of each, then bp 100 of Chr6 will instead be denoted (approximately) bp 1,080,000,100 of the genome - this makes the difference in these positions crystal clear.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28303,"question_id":28190,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1423058601}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28190/snps-and-locations","last_activity_date":1423058601,"creation_date":1422653775,"answer_count":2,"title":"SNPs and locations","body":"<p>I am new to reading raw DNA.

Different women experience menstruation differently depending on the levels of different hormones in their body, personal medical conditions, medications, on their age, and the activities they do in their lives.

Because of this it is a slightly darker colour than just regular old blood. This of course varies with women with blood disorders or taking medication to \"thin\" the blood bleeding a lot more. The second day is typically the worst. On the worst day a woman may use 3-6 pads but this can be substantially more and changing every 2-3 hours is not uncommon. It is most typically more or less constant with some worse moments in the day, but there is a huge variation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clots are quite common but not all women get them. They're typically more common in older females and may look just like tissue. The size of these clots can very from the size of peas to grapes and even larger than 6-7cm in some women. This is a little more worrying as this may cause anaemia or iron deficiency unlike the regular bleeding above which typically doesn't. Women affected with blood clots are much more likely to have pain. <\/p>\n\n<p>Pain itself is more common in younger women. However usually this settles down and usually it is not painful enough to affect daily activities. In some women however they get dysmennorrhea which basically means painful uterine cramps. This is because the blood flow to the uterus is restricted due to the hormone balance and the muscle is contracting really powerfully. The lack of blood flow causes the muscle to get starved of oxygen and the pain is said to be similar to angina or like a heart attack (both being caused by a similar mechanism). <\/p>\n\n<p>Menorrhagia is the medical term for heavy periods. This is characterised by more than 80 ml of fluid each month and affects 1 in 10 women. Usually this is diagnosed by the number of pads and tampons used. Women affected by this may require to double protect, use both a tampon and pad. They may also take a number of extra underwear or trousers to work. The symptom affecting these women is termed flooding. Unexpectedly they get a \"flood\" which just basically goes everywhere and is uncontrollable and is usually quite a lot of volume. This is sometimes due to an underlying disease, of which, is most commonly fibroids but may also be contraceptive devices that go into the womb/uterus, blood thinners or polycystic ovary syndrome. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is however much variation. Some women will have only 10ml or so of blood (light periods) and that's normal for them. Some women may have irregular bleeding lasting all month. Other women may have longer periods such as 10 or even 20 days per cycle. And then cycles themselves can vary from short (20 or so days) to very long with only a few cycles per year. Basically there is every variation possible under the sun. <\/p>\n","answer_id":28239,"question_id":28088,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28088/how-does-menstruation-proceed-during-one-period","last_activity_date":1423017580,"creation_date":1422372816,"answer_count":3,"title":"How does menstruation proceed during one period?","body":"<p>I'm simplifying things here:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A.<\/strong> Does a woman bleed <strong>constantly<\/strong>, like a drop every 10 minutes?

Magnesium for example is needed in every chlorophyll, so there is no photosynthesis without magnesium. Another point is that plants can not get nitrogen from the air, so they have to get it from the soil and nitrogen is present in every amino acid, which build the plants proteins.

There is no effective way to turn off our senses. The best way to explain what happens in sleep is that at some point (the last point, actually), our <em>cognitive processing<\/em> of sensations changes. That is, our higher brain functions allow us to ignore certain sensory input. This effect has been most studied in sound perception.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a sleep study involving sound and EEG/fMRI during all phases of (drug-free) sleep,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first significant result of this study is that the pattern of brain activation associated with auditory stimulation was strikingly similar in wakefulness and sleep, suggesting that sensory processing occurred in both conditions. However, we found qualitative differences in brain activation associated with auditory processing during sleep compared to wakefulness. The reduced regional activity during sleep, compared to wakefulness, in the left parietal and, bilaterally, in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus (part of the limbic system) suggests that these areas may be involved in the further processing and perceptual integration of sensory inputs likely to occur during wakefulness only.<sup>[1]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Supporting this is evidence that some sounds awaken someone no matter at what stage they are in sleep, for example, young mothers are woken up by their infants' lightest movements<sup>[2]<\/sup>, and the fact that we respond to our own names in a similar fashion in sleep and in wakefulness, but such responses are not shown for presentation of other first names.<sup>[3]<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These results suggest that the sleeping brain, during SII and PS, elicits a differential cognitive response to the presentation of the subject's own name, comparable to that occurring during wakefulness, and therefore that the sleeping brain is able to detect and categorize some particular aspects of stimulus significance.<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, the results suggest that when subjects were listening to their own name during sleep some brain regions were selectively more responsive than in any other condition. ...we have demonstrated that the sleeping brain is able to process auditory stimuli. In addition, we postulate the existence of a functional network capable of detecting and facilitating processing of emotionally relevant inputs during sleep.<sup>[1]<\/sup>  <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Our results support the view that PS is not a state of \"sensory isolation\"; failure to respond to external stimuli during this stage may depend upon mechanisms occurring only after the sensory input has undergone cognitive analysis.<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, as you noted, odors are not good at waking people up.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some suggest that the human olfactory system during sleep is sufficiently well tuned to ensure arousal to such threatening stimuli as odors associated with smoke from fire. Our results strongly suggest otherwise. The intensity, strength, and noxiousness of the pyridine stimulus elicited behavioral arousal or EEG activation on fewer than half of stage 2 trials, less than one third of REM-sleep trials, and virtually no stage-4- sleep trials. This is a nontrivial lack of response, since pyridine is a component of coal tar and is also used as a herbicide for firewood, and thus is a likely by-product of many real fires. In practical terms, therefore, olfactory awareness in humans is low to absent during sleep, and human olfaction appears insufficiently sensitive and reliable to act as a sentinel system. We further note that auditory arousal threshold is highest in young and sleep-deprived individuals, increasing the likelihood that olfactory processing is even worse for children and sleep-deprived adults.<sup>[5]<\/sup> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The methodology in the olfactory study varies quite significantly from the auditory study. Better studies may shed more evidence on why olfactory stimuli are processed differently from other stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p>As to what percent?

This is termed 'vasodilation' and 'vasoconstriction'. Large and mid-sized vessels contain smooth muscle in their walls. The walls of arteries tend to be stiffer than those of veins, to withstand high pressure coming from the heart.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/66uxm.jpg\" alt=\"Cross-sectional cartoon of the walls of arteries and veins.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Smooth muscle, when stimulated by the nervous system, can sustain contractions for long periods of time, and often with fine control. When smooth muscle in the walls of your blood vessels relaxes, those vessels will dilate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Small capillaries do not have smooth muscle in their walls, but the flow of blood through them can be controlled by the larger vessels that feed them. When arterioles constrict, the capillaries they feed can have reduced flow.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPGBy.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon of a capillary bed.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Our nervous system takes in a lot of signals relevant to controlling blood pressure and flow, and controls these smooth muscles. Flow can be increased or decreased to individual organs when needed, like the intestine (after a meal), the muscles (during exercise), the skin (for heat exchange).<\/p>\n\n<p>The question about warm water is actually quite interesting. Placing your arm in warm water will cause <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2342852/\" rel=\"nofollow\">vasodilation in your other arm<\/a> (the one not in the water), in order to lose some heat to the cold air and maintain your core temperature. Normally, the blood vessels in our 'extremities' (our hands and feet) are kept quite constricted to reduce heat loss with the cold air. \nIf we exercise or take a hot bath our core temperature will rise, some people will notice their skin gain a red hue after these activities, due to vasodilation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28267,"question_id":28258,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DNPz8.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11841,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11841/one-face","reputation":2241,"display_name":"One Face","accept_rate":73},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1422951452,"creation_date":1422951452,"body":"<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capillaries<\/a> are the smallest blood vessels.

Many species are now threatened by extinction (e.g. American eel and European eel), since they have been heavily exploited by fisheries and they are also vulnerable to habitat modifications (e.g. hydroelectric dams) and pollution. The nature of their life history was also unknown for a long time, since they migrate and spawn in the Sargasso Sea after living many years in fresh water (so the opposite migration path compared to Salmon), which is called a <em>catadromous<\/em> life history. However, there are also many species of eel that are strictly marine, for instance the very large <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_conger\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Conger conger<\/em><\/a>, but many of these species still migrate long distances before mating. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/11Tm1.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n(American eel, <em>Anguilla rostrata<\/em>, picture from Wikipedia in public domain)<\/p>\n\n<p>As a fun sidenote, captive eel can become very old, and earlier this year a more than 155-year-old European eel that was kept in a well died (see <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/20140808/worlds-oldest-eel-dies-in-sweden\" rel=\"nofollow\">newsstory<\/a>) - the oldest known eel from what I know. Eels were often put in wells because they were believed to keep the well water clean.<\/p>\n\n<p>Semelpary is also found in other fish species, for instance in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelt_%28fish%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smelt (Osmeridae)<\/a> family, where many species are fished commercially. Some (most?) species in the family have multiyear life histories, but some, e.g. the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_smelt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delta smelt (<em>Hypomesus transpacificus<\/em>)<\/a> only live for a single year. Similarly to Salmon, Smelt also migrate from sea to freshwater to spawn, i.e. an <em>anadromous<\/em> life history.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, less than 1% of teleost fish are semelparous according to <a href=\"https://books.google.se/books?id=_JkMRundeNcC&amp;pg=PA592#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Finch. 1994. Longevity, Senescence, and the Genome. University of Chicago Press\">Finch (1994)<\/a> - see link for more examples of semelparous fish species and background. However, this figure is most likely uncertain, given that we know very little about the life history of many marine species. In some cases, you can also find a range of life-history strategies from semelparous to partially or totally iteroparous within the same species, depending on ecological context. Nevertheless, the low overall proportion of semelparous fish means that semelpary is generally a rare life history strategy in human exploited fish species.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLqzj.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n(Delta smelt, <em>Hypomesus transpacificus<\/em>, picture from Wikipedia in public domain)<\/p>\n","answer_id":28249,"question_id":28247,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1422870100}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28247/what-fish-and-or-shellfish-species-with-a-multi-year-life-cycle-besides-salmo","last_activity_date":1422870100,"creation_date":1422830502,"answer_count":1,"title":"What fish (and/or shellfish) species with a multi-year life-cycle, besides salmon, die after spawning?","body":"<p>Most species of salmon die after spawning.

The researchers found that animals with eyes and facial features that are easier to discern are more likely to live and hunt socially. (One of the authors, S. Kohshima, has studied the morphology of the human eye, its adaptive meaning, and has done comparative studies on external morphology of the primate eye.) <\/p>\n\n<p>In this paper, the authors identified three face-eye types based on four contrast indices: the A-type, in which both pupil position in the eye outline <em>and<\/em> eye position in the face were conspicuous (11 species, including wolves and coyotes); the B-type, in which only eye position on the face was conspicuous (9 species, including the Fennec fox and jackals); and the C-type, in which both the pupil and eye position were inconspicuous (6 species, including the bush dog and the African wild dog). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yZj5N.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>They compared group living vs. solo/pair living, group hunting vs. solo hunting, gaze duration and other parameters. Citing supporting evidence from other authors as well, they found that in species engaging in group living, 8 of 10 study species exhibit A-type faces. African wild dogs (C-type) use their white-tipped tails as visual signals, and like dingos, use vocalization, suggesting a developed acoustic communication. In contrast, gray wolves made almost no sound even during play or fighting but had more gazing behavior in more postures. Therefore, species with B- or C-type faces that in engage group living may use acoustic and/or other visual signals instead of the gaze signal as their primary means of communication (as is true for wolves and dogs). The enhanced gaze-signal of the A-type face could be disadvantageous during hunting, as prey animals could use the gaze signal to realize that they have been targeted by the predator and then prepare to escape. A-type faces were more common, then, in group hunting, where solo hunters were more commonly B or C-type faces.<\/p>\n\n<p>In gray wolves, the gazing behavior (0.5s on average to humans, 3.32s average with up to 38s maximum with other wolves), termed <em>conspecific<\/em> with others of the same species, suggest that the gaze signal of gray wolves is mainly used for communication among conspecifics.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These results suggest that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication and that canids with A-type faces, especially gray wolves, use the gaze signal in conspecific communication... Our comparison of face morphology and gazing behavior among canid species highlighted the gaze-signal communication in species with A-type faces, especially gray wolves, and provided a novel perspective for studies on their communication and morphology.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Could the cooperative eye hypothesis apply to dogs as well? If not, then for what reason might dogs utilize eye movement as they seem to do? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes. (By the way, many dogs have white sclera.) The difficulty is that dogs are usually raised alone with humans and can lose the ability to \"read\" other dogs. One study, however, examined the behavior of dogs with human social cues (such as gazing) and conspecific (other dog) social cues. (Primates have been found to respond to conspecific social cues more than human gaze/pointing.) When the informant in this study (the one giving the cues) was an unfamiliar human, dogs responded well to gaze and gaze/pointing. However, when the informant was an unfamiliar dog (tethered, standing still, no human around to look at), the dogs were also able to follow the <em>gaze<\/em> of the informant dog, even when the body pointed elsewhere. Furthermore,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This skill with conspecifics is somewhat surprising because many of these domestic dogs had had only limited experience with other dogs. Indeed, the one intriguing developmental finding was that the 6-month old juvenile was <em>only able to use cues produced by conspecifics<\/em>, whereas two 4-year olds (the oldest in the sample) were only able to use human cues. ...it does suggest the hypothesis that many dogs are able to use conspecific gaze cues from early in life without extensive experience with conspecifics, and then ontogenetically, they extend this ability to humans (to some degree on the basis of similarities in human and dog facial features) as they interact with them - perhaps in some cases to the point that they lose their ability with conspecifics.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If more studies focused on conspcific cues among dogs instead of focusing on their interactions with humans, I think this behavior would be borne out and would be readily established.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098217\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Comparison of Facial Color Pattern and Gazing Behavior in Canid Species Suggests Gaze Communication in Gray Wolves (Canis lupus)<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016888\" rel=\"nofollow\">Development of Gaze Following Abilities in Wolves (Canis Lupus)<\/a> (interesting video)<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/uploads/assets/HareTomasello1999_DomesticDogsUseCues%20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris) Use Human and Conspecific Social Cues to Locate Hidden Food<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2251326/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Review of Domestic Dogs' (Canis Familiaris) Human-Like Behaviors: Or Why Behavior Analysts Should Stop Worrying and Love Their Dogs<\/a> (just a cool paper)<\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":28198,"question_id":28169,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1422743259}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28169/can-canines-communicate-with-each-other-using-gaze-direction","last_activity_date":1422816232,"creation_date":1422591974,"answer_count":2,"title":"Can canines communicate with each other using gaze direction?","body":"<p>After researching why humans have white scleras when most primates have dark scleras, I stumbled upon the cooperative eye hypothesis.

This relation is linear.<\/p>\n\n<p>The pressure inside the body equalises with the pressure outside to prevent any deformation. The solid and liquid components of the body can withstand pressures upto 151 atm (depth of 1.5 km underwater) without undergoing any noticeable compression. But air, being extremely compressible undergoes compression. <\/p>\n\n<p>So at 2 atmospheric pressure the space occupied by the air in our body is halved. This would shrink the lungs to half the total volume. To circumvent this the divers breathe air compressed at the same pressure as the water pressure around them, so that the pressure gradient across the chest wall is normal. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Pressure Concentration relationship:<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dalton's Law:<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This law states that the Barometric Pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the air mixture.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Barometric Pressure - The total pressure measured<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In air at 1 atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg) the partial pressures of various gases are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nitrogen ~ 593 mm Hg<\/li>\n<li>Oxygen   ~ 159 mm Hg<\/li>\n<li>Co<sub>2<\/sub> ~ 0.2 mm Hg<\/li>\n<li>Others   ~ 7 mm Hg<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>According to this Law, as the pressure inside the Lungs increase, the partial pressures of each gas increases. At 2 atm, the partial pressures of every gas doubles. <\/p>\n\n<p>The gas exchange in the lungs is based on <strong>partial pressure<\/strong> of the gases. Thus due to increased partial pressure, the amount of gases dissolved in blood increases (This increase is proportionate to the pressure levels). <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0NUzB.jpg\" alt=\"Pressure at increasing depth of immersion\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During a extended dive (one lasting several hours) the body tissues gradually equilibriate with the high-pressure gases. At sea level our body contains 1 L of dissolved nitrogen, equally distributed between body's water and fat. As partial pressure of Nitrogen rises, the nitrogen equilibriates with the body's lipid stores because adipose tissue is relatively underperfused.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Once equilibrium is achieved the volume of nitrogen dissolved in tissues is proportional to the alveolar partial pressure of nitrogen. Thus at 4 atm the body will contain 4 L of nitrogen. <\/p>\n\n<p>The same principle applies to oxygen as well, though the solubility of oxygen and the speed at which equilibrium is attained are different.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Decompression<\/h2>\n\n<p>During ascent from the depths, the Barometric Pressure (surrounding pressure P<sub>b<\/sub>) falls. As the P<sub>b<\/sub> falls the pressure inside the alveoli fall as well. This causes a fall in the partial pressures of all gases in the lungs creating a gradient of gases from the tissues to the alveoli. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the diver has to ascend slowly to <strong>give enough time<\/strong> for the gases to move into blood from the tissues and then get washed out. If the ascent is too rapid, gases dissolved in the tissues - due to high pressure - attains the gaseous form (due to pressure drop) and become bubbles. This is similar to opening a pressurised coke can where one can observe gas bubbles forming.<\/p>\n\n<p>The bubbles are the reason for the bends. Bubbles can also cause serious problems like arterial gas embolisation, CNS disorders (due to formation of bubbles in the myelin sheath of axons which compromise nerve conduction), pulmonary symptoms (due to pulmonary emboli), sometimes even Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Solution<\/h2>\n\n<p>The decompression is done in stages - in which the divers spend various amount of time at various under water levels to allow complete diffusion of dissolved gases into blood and into the alveoli which is consequently breathed out.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/n5K1h.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<h2>Hyperbaric Chamber<\/h2>\n\n<p>The hyperbaric chamber is used when the above solution is not applied i.e. the diver has surfaced rapidly without spending sufficient time at various levels to allow proper decompression.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a hyperbaric chamber the diver is recompressed to the pressures equal to the pressure experienced at the level to which the diver dived. Due to the increase in pressure, the bubbles get dissolved again. This instantly relieves many symptoms - like the nerve conduction delay, bends, niggles etc... Now the decompression is carried out by under controlled environment, simulating the various intervals the diver has to stay at various pressure levels under water.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this explains your doubt. <\/p>\n\n<p>So coming to myocardial infarction, the hyperbaric chamber redissolves the gas bubbles thus preventing myocardial infarction.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For more info read chapter 61 of Medical Physiology, 2<sup>nd<\/sup> edition, by Walter F.

Since there is nowhere else to go, it goes into the bloodstream where oxygenated blood is supposed to be. This is detected by the chemoreceptors in your arteries; this then tells the heart to beat faster in attempts to rid the body of CO2. Once again; however, this doesn't happen because now there are more nitrogen bubbles from breathing in more nitrogen and water.

Emphasizing ecological similarities rather than similarities in relatedness, they can be regarded as complementary approach to, but not as a replacement of taxonomy. Why do we need this? Because species often perform very similar tasks, exhibit very similar characteristics and, most importantly, are very, very numerous (there are ~ 300,000 vascular plants). Reducing this redundant complexity is crucial for decision-making in conservation politics or the projection of vegetation change under future climatic conditions (Woodward &amp; Cramer, 1996).<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea behind this is to use functional traits, such as seed size, height, photosynthetic pathway, root density, etc., as a surrogate of a species' ecological 'role' -- its response to environmental factors and its impact on ecosystems. Seed mass for example (functional trait), is a proxy for the dispersal ability of a plant (function, performance). You should have a look at Lavorel et al. (2007), there is a nice table (too big to include here) that links specific traits to the actual ecological functions they describe.

To make up one example, a functional type that might emerge from species with the following traits<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>height: > 20 m<\/li>\n<li>seed size: > 0.5 cm<\/li>\n<li>woody: yes<\/li>\n<li>Specific leaf area: low<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>would certainly represent climax forest trees.

Most of these studies focused on resistance in crops (e.g., maize) or black grass. One of these studies (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357599924392\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kay et al., 1999<\/a>) was particularly interesting as it focused on several possible mechanisms of herbicide resistance in <em>Alopecurus myosuroides<\/em> (Black-Grass). I quote from the abstract:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] Resistance at the whole-plant level correlated well with <strong>reduced acetyl Co-enzyme A carboxylase sensitivity (target site resistance)<\/strong> in two of the populations (one from the United Kingdom and one from Germany) but <strong>enhanced metabolism<\/strong> appeared to be the primary mechanism of resistance in the majority of the other populations. [...] We suggest that resistance in Lincs E1 may be explained by <strong>multiple resistance mechanisms<\/strong>\u2014the expression of both <strong>insensitive acetyl Co-enzyme A carboxylase<\/strong> and an <strong>increased rate of detoxification<\/strong>. However, resistance in the population Clay from the United Kingdom could be explained neither by target site insensitivity nor by an enhanced rate of metabolism. These results provide conclusive evidence that a single resistance mechanism alone cannot explain insensitivity to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl in European resistant black-grass populations and that additional, as yet uncharacterized, mechanisms must also be present.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So based on these data, I think several mechanisms may play a role in the cool season lawn grass resistance (a species name may help to specify my, admittedly, broad answer).<\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl is an acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357599924392\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kay et al., 1999)<\/a>. Note that Haloxyfop (as mentioned in your question <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28105/how-does-haloxyfop-control-young-grassy-weeds-in-fields-of-broadleaved-crops/28106#28106\">\"How does Haloxyfop control young grassy weeds in fields of broadleaved crops?\"<\/a>) is also an ACC inhibitor. From the answer on that question it appears that ACC inhibitors inhibit cell membrane formation and that <em>monocots<\/em> (grasses) are most susceptible and <em>dicots<\/em> less. <em>Dicots<\/em> are less sensitive because they have two ACC types at their disposal, one being insensitive to ACC inhibitors. Not surprisingly then, Bermuda grass, being a <em>monocot<\/em> is killed by this herbicide. Interestingly however, <strong>other <em>monocots<\/em> seem to survive<\/strong>, such as the cool-season lawns you mention. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was not able to find conclusive evidence as to why some <em>monocots<\/em> survive ACC inhibitors. An <strong>educated guess<\/strong> is that resistance can be conferred by <strong>mutations in the ACC enzyme<\/strong> (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220100607\" rel=\"nofollow\">Letouzé &amp; Gasquez, 2001<\/a>) that make the enzyme less sensitive to the herbicide. These mutations can be caused by repeated exposure to these herbicides, whereby strains become resistant to the material, much like the way in which (multi-) resistant bacterial strains emerge after repeated exposure to antibiotics.     <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357599924392\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kay et al.

Below is a direct quote from Human Molecular Genetics, 2ed. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 9: Instability of the human genome: mutation and DNA repair<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mutations can be induced in our DNA by exposure to a variety of mutagens occurring in our external environment or to mutagens generated in the intracellular environment. In the case of radiation-induced mutation, for example, Dubrova et al. 1996 reported that the normal germline mutation rate for hypervariable minisatellite loci was doubled as a consequence of heavy exposure to the radiaoctive fallout from the Chernobyl accident. However, under normal circumstances by far the greatest source of mutations is from endogenous mutation, notably spontaneous errors in DNA replication and repair. During an average human lifetime there are an estimated 10^17 cell divisions: about 2 × 10^14 divisions are required to generate the approximately 10^14 cells in the adult, and additional mitoses are required to permit cell renewal in the case of certain cell types, notably epithelial cells (see Cairns, 1975). As each cell division requires the incorporation of 6 × 10^9 new nucleotides, error-free DNA replication in an average lifetime would require a DNA replication-repair process with an accuracy great enough so that the correct nucleotide was inserted on the growing DNA strands on each of about 6 × 10^26 occasions.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Such a level of DNA replication fidelity is impossible to sustain; indeed, the observed fidelity of replication of DNA polymerases is very much less than this and uncorrected replication errors occur with a frequency of about 10^-9 to 10^-11 per incorporated nucleotide (see Cooper et al., 1995). As the coding DNA of an average human gene is about 1.7 kb, coding DNA mutations will occur spontaneously with an average frequency of about 1.7 × 10^-6 -1.7 × 10^-8 per gene per cell division. <strong>Thus, during the approximately 10^16 mitoses undergone in an average human lifetime, each gene will be a locus for about 10^8-10^10 mutations (but for any one gene, only a tiny minority of cells will carry a mutation). In many cases, a deleterious gene mutation in a somatic cell will be inconsequential: the mutation may cause lethality for that single cell, but will not have consequences for other cells. However, in some cases, the mutation may lead to an inappropriate continuation of cell division, causing cancer<\/strong> (see Chapter 18).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/50/23/7415.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is another great paper<\/a> that specifically addresses your question, linking increased cell division with the accumulation of both significant and insignificant mutations, which over time, lead to an accumulation of mutations needed for cancer to develop.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":28221,"question_id":27935,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1422746701}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27935/does-increased-cell-turnover-cause-cancerous-mutations","last_activity_date":1422746701,"creation_date":1421905597,"answer_count":1,"title":"Does increased cell turnover cause cancerous mutations?","body":"<p>If a certain set of cells or tissue are undergoing a lot of reproduction and repair cycles for some reason, does this inevitably lead to cancerous growths?

Early research has\n  proposed that the selectivity of auxinic herbicide is because of either <strong>limited translocation or rapid degradation of exogenous auxin, altered vascular anatomy, or altered perception of auxin in monocots<\/strong> [...] The difference in vascular tissue structure between dicots and monocots may contribute to the selectivity of auxinic herbicides. In monocot stems, the vascular tissues (the phloem and xylem) are scattered in bundles, and lack a vascular cambium; in dicot stems, the vascular tissues are formed in rings and possess a cambium. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So in all, the exact mechanism of specificity between <em>monocots<\/em> and <em>dicots<\/em> is unclear, but may be related to structural and/or metabolical (pharmacokinetical) and/or different pharmacodynamical differences between <em>monocots<\/em> and <em>dicots<\/em> in general. <em>Dicots<\/em> are susceptible to auxin herbicides, while grasses, being <em>monocots<\/em>, are protected. <\/p>\n\n<p>The complexity of the auxin hormonal system (<a href=\"http://210.72.92.31/bitstream/353005/4867/1/Insight%20into%20the%20mode%20of%20action%20of%202,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic%20acid%20(2,4-D)%20as%20an%20herbicide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Song, 2014<\/a>) may explain why differences exist between grass species, but this is speculative.     <\/p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>References<\/strong><\/sup><br>\n<sup><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357507000545\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelly &amp; Riechers, <em>Pesticide Biochem Physiol<\/em> 2007;<strong>89<\/strong>:1\u201311<\/a><\/sup><br>\n<sup><a href=\"http://210.72.92.31/bitstream/353005/4867/1/Insight%20into%20the%20mode%20of%20action%20of%202,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic%20acid%20(2,4-D)%20as%20an%20herbicide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Song, <em>J Integr Plant Biol<\/em> 2014; <strong>56<\/strong>:106\u201313<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":28203,"question_id":19938,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1422744505}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19938/why-doesnt-clopyralid-damage-cool-season-lawn-grasses","last_activity_date":1422744505,"creation_date":1406257899,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why doesn't Clopyralid damage cool season lawn grasses?","body":"<p>I use <a href=\"http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDAS/dh_08e8/0901b803808e856e.pdf?filepath=turf/pdfs/noreg/010-60417.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clopyralid<\/a> (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxilic acid) to kill broad leaved weeds in lawns.

Given that water would diffuse into the bag, the question to be answered was whether there would be an equilibrium increase of sugar concentration outside the bag.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment:<\/strong> one-inch dialysis tubing, bovine serum albumin (BSA), dextrose, an inexpensive commercial glucose meter, test strips for the meter.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>General procedure:<\/strong>  A control dextrose solution was divided between a sac made of dialysis tubing and a drinking glass.  A small mass of powdered BSA was added to the sac. The sac was suspended in the sugar-only solution and the solution <em>outside the bag<\/em> checked at 13 times during a 33-hour period. At about 8 hours protein was added to the bag since neither diffusion nor osmosis was being observed. After this the bag began to swell. Due to concern that BSA would affect the reading the measurements were compared with the control solution and not the inside of the bag$^1$. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Results:<\/strong> Results are given in the table below. Addition of protein is indicated by the arrow in the graph. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion:<\/strong> This procedure was suggested in this <a href=\"http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14005/help-with-simple-diy-procedure-to-measure-diffusion\">answer<\/a> at the Chemistry SE. The meter requires some practice to use. Protein was added to the bag in roughly 200mg increments until an influx of water occurred. <em>The solutions had probably reached equilibrium within a few hours of adding the extra protein but fluctuation in temperature made this difficult to determine.<\/em> The gross trends correspond to air-conditioner use.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong> This procedure was done twice with similar results. The results are qualitative and suggest that sugar diffuses out through the membrane. This result is consistent with the <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/116255/a-simple-osmosis-problem\">answer at PhysicsSE<\/a> and also this <a href=\"http://www.mun.ca/biology/Osmosis_Diffusion/tutor2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">website<\/a> (Figure 4.1) which indicates that diffusion and osmosis (diffusion of water) both occur. <strong>At equilibrium the concentration of sugar is slightly higher outside the bag.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems/issues<\/strong> :  (1) The meter is very sensitive to temperature $^2.$ (2) Perhaps because the dextrose was incompletely dissolved the measurement of control solutions took about an hour to stabilize. That is why the measurements begin at 110 minutes. (3) The meter gave errors outside a range of 30-500 mg/dl and after checking the standard deviation for a few concentrations of dextrose a concentration of 90 mg/dl was chosen. (4) It was not assumed that the meter functioned properly in the presence of BSA. Except for the last measurements, the glucose was measured outside the bag only.<\/p>\n\n<p>$^1$ Four measurements were taken with the meter within 2 minutes of the last measurement to check variability of the meter. The numbers [mg/dl] were: 90, 94, 93, 89, $\\mu = 91.5, \\sigma = 2.38.$ At the last measurement the glucose concentration inside the bag was checked twice and the meter gave: 72, 80.  <\/p>\n\n<p>$^2$ Concentration should remain the same after equilibrium [Fick equation] and should not be affected by temperature.

In an infinite population, an allele can rise in frequency (if its fitness is greater than the fitness of its counterpart(s)).

Getting the plasmid either happens during cell division (when the nucleus is not present) or by adding a signal sequence to the plasmid which induces the import into the nucleus through nuclear pores. The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8956280\">SV40 sequence<\/a> is an example of such a sequence. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you have the right promoter present on the plasmid, you can basically express any protein in the cell (unless it's toxic). The promoter either needs to come from the organism from which the cells are or has to be something universally activated like the CMV promoter (from the cytomegalo virus).<\/p>\n\n<p>A good example for this is the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) which originates from jellyfish and can be expressed in cells to make them glow green (from <a href=\"http://www.thermoscientificbio.com/transfection/turbofect-transfection-reagent/\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/evBzT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Untransfected cells or cells transfected with an empty plasmid (without GFP) don't glow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Targeting specific cells or control the specific activation of genes only in one cell type is possible. For both you need sequence (and cell specific) promoter sequences which either allow the nuclear import (see reference 1-3) or the expression from a cell type specific promoter (see reference 4).<\/p>\n\n<p>This has been done in the liver of mice in which the ApoE has been knocked-out. The expression of the human ApoE gene with a specific promoter led to the correction of the hypercholesterolemia the mice were suffering from. This needs a lot of knowledge on the promoter as well as on the other transcriptional regulation elements in the specific gene (see reference 4).<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10455402\">Cell-specific nuclear import of plasmid DNA.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19393704\">Tissue-specific and transcription factor-mediated nuclear entry of\nDNA.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200566\">Progress and prospects: nuclear import of nonviral vectors.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.filedropper.com/wooddell2008\">Sustained liver-specific transgene expression from the albumin\npromoter in mice following hydrodynamic plasmid DNA delivery.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":28176,"question_id":28175,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1422630353}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28175/plasmid-in-the-nucleus-and-gene-expression","last_activity_date":1422630353,"creation_date":1422618086,"answer_count":1,"title":"Plasmid in the nucleus and gene expression","body":"<p>If we insert a plasmid into a <strong>human nucleus<\/strong> that contains exact copy of gene and all relevant promoters to produce <strong>some human protein<\/strong>,  will the cell create functional protein from that plasmid <strong>only<\/strong> when the cell needs it?<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not talking about inserting DNA to some chromosome.

The answer is glucose.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's begin at the beginning: you eat a piece of fruit. The fruit contains many different kinds of sugars, including fructose and glucose. One of the immediate effects your digestion of this fruit has is to raise the levels in your blood of every type of sugar that was present, and the blood levels of many other types of nutrients as well. This has nothing to do with how well your body does/doesn't absorb fructose, it is simply a normal step in digestion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, <a href=\"http://ressources.unisciel.fr/biocell/chap2/res/glucose_transporter_family_Wood.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GLUT2 transporters in the insulin producing cells in your pancreas import glucose<\/a>. This acts as a signal that tells those cells to start producing insulin. Insulin then diffuses around the body and produces myriad effects, including upregulation of GLUT4  activity across the body. These GLUT4 transporters are present on cells in many parts of your body and are what are responsible for taking up most of the glucose from your blood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now on to fructose. GLUT5 is the main fructose transporter. Just like GLUT4, GLUT5 activity is also regulated by insulin, but in a less quick and dramatic fashion than with GLUT4. Although there's a large body of work showing that GLUT5 does not respond quickly to insulin, recent work has shown that, for example, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12914929\" rel=\"nofollow\">high levels of insulin lead to increased GLUT5 activity in skeletal muscle over a period of 24 hours<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if what your trying to get at is some reason why eating an apple is better for you than chugging an equivalent volume of Auntie Jemimah's pure corn syrup, it's always going to be some reason like this where you have co-metabolism of several nutrients that tend to show up together in \"natural\" food.

If so, what are they?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, many polyphenols (e.g. resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, anthocyanins, phloretin, etc.) do this and much more. Each fruit and vegetable has its polyphenol composition. There are other beneficial fruit and vegetable compounds as well, but I'll talk only about polyphenols in the current post.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sucrose is split by digestive enzymes (sucrase, glycoside hydrolase) in the small intestine into fructose and glucose. These enzymes are inhibited by polyphenols. <\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose is transported by SGLT1, while fructose is transported by GLUT5 into enterocytes in the intestines. After that the cells transport these sugars with GLUT2 into the blood. Polypheonls can inhibit these transporters and decrease their expression.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fructose and glucose is transported to the liver from the blood, with GLUT2, and they do nasty things in there. Fructose is more dangerous than glucose, because it is transformed without any regulation. It uses the same pathways as glucose and mostly fatty acids are created from it, which increase the blood VLDL, LDL, FFA level and cause insulin resistance. The byproducts are urate and free radicals, which cause hyperuricaemia and oxidative stress. Hyperuricaemia cause decreased NO levels (by counteracting with eNOS and reacting with NO directly), which cause increased blood pressure due to vasoconstriction. Hyperuricaemia damages the liver and the kidney too. Too high urate levels enhance LDL oxidation as well, which cause atherosclerosis. The free radicals deplete the antioxidants of the body and cause cancer. Polyphenols prevent atherosclerosis, restore NO levels, restore urate levels, scavenge free radicals, counteract with insulin resistance and prevent liver and kidney damage. So they can fix most of the problems fructose cause.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The interactions of gallic acid and tannic acid with purified brush\n  border sucrase (EC 3.2.1.48) from mouse intestine have been studied.\n  These findings indicate that both gallic acid and tannic acid inhibit\n  sucrase activity, which is pH dependent.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BSR20090012\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BSR20090012<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The effects of tea polyphenols on the sucrase activity are shown in\n  Table .1.

Other data, however, have indicated that the mutation bias reported relative to gender and male age are not generally well correlated with the number of germ cell divisions and that other factors could explain these trends, such as methylation patterns, differential repair, metabolic rates, and preferential transmission of mutations to pro- geny from older males (Risch et al., 1987; Martin and Palumbi, 1993; Drost and Lee, 1995; Bromham et al., 1996; Hurst and Ellegren, 1998; Martin, 1999; Crow, 2000; Huttley et al., 2000; McVean, 2000; Sommer et al., 2001;Hebert et al., 2002; Hurst and Ellegren, 2002; Kumar and Subramanian, 2002; Li et al., 2002; Bartosch-Harlid et al., 2003).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\u2026so basically <strong>we don't really know<\/strong> whether difference in gametogenesis between males and females lead to more sex and age-specific mutation rate!<\/p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/9/1847.full.pdf+html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whittle and Johnston (2006)<\/a> in reviewing many articles also show that old seeds are more likely to carry chromosomal aberration and that old individuals are more likely because of the instability of their metabolism to transmit more mutations but that would be sex independent and would not result in different gametogenesis as I was expecting in asking this question.

The melanocytes are found in the basal cell layer at the border between epidermis and dermis as shown in the figure below (from <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/terminology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wyAQw.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The melanocytes spread out their dendrites between the keratinocytes and transport the melanosomes (pigment containing vacuoles) to them to pigment these cells. This is a highly regulated process and depends strongly on the interaction between keratinocytes and melanocytes. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the so-called paracrine pathway the keratinocytes secret substances which regulate the production of melanin. These are for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone\" rel=\"nofollow\">alpha-MSH<\/a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone\" rel=\"nofollow\">ACTH<\/a>, which stimulate the melanocytes to produces more melanin.<\/p>\n\n<p>This regulation is the key to the hyperpigmentation. During the proliferation or the inflammation chemokines and hormones are produced (and secreted) in the skin which stimulate keratinocytes and fibroblasts. These are for example the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), as well as the chemokines IL1-alpha and TNF-alpha. This stimulation leads to the production of ACTH (and derived peptides) by the keratinocytes and the secretion of stem cell factor (SCF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by the fibroblasts which all induce pigmentation. The chemokine secretion is also enhanced from the keratinocytes by KGF. If you are interested in a deeper view at this topic, have a look at reference 1 (and the references in the paper). Reference 2 goes deeper into the regulation of the paracrine signalling.<\/p>\n\n<p>In an injury (especially in larger areas of the skin) a lot of cells are damaged and need to be replaced. This functions via cell division but also via the migration of cells into the affected area.

Going all the way back to Darwin, one hypothesis has been that females prefer males with long tails. There seems to be evidence for this, although experimental reduction or elongation of tail feathers is perhaps of questionable success. See this <a href=\"http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/1/112.full\">back and forth in Behavioral Ecology<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those interested in the study of flight have also studied elongate tail feathers to get at the questions you ask: are long tail feathers aerodynamically costly?<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/340/1294/361\">Balmford (1993)<\/a> compared the aerodynamic properties of different tail shapes. He found that:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A forked tail that has a triangular planform when spread to just over 120° gives the best aerodynamic performance and this may be close to a universal optimum, in terms of aerodynamic efficiency, for a means to control pitch and yaw.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But the results were more complicated. Forked tails are only used in extreme maneuvers, they are more unstable, and suffer from greater loss of performance when damaged. He leaves open the possibility that natural selection, rather than or in addition to sexual selection, has played a role in shaping bird tails, possibly for increased aerodynamic performance.<\/p>\n\n<p>More relevant here, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v361/n6413/abs/361628a0.html\">Balmford et al. (1993)<\/a> studied pairs of species, one with a long tail and one without, to assess the aerodynamic cost of long tail feathers. They studied ~600 specimens and used aerodynamic modeling to predict cost. Their results are summarized in this figure:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ki6tv.png\" alt=\"Tail Shape\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Graduated (rounded) tails are costliest over all lengths. Forked tails are notably less costly over all lengths, and shallow forks more efficient than deep forks (but there the difference is not great).<\/p>\n\n<p>They conclude:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our model suggests that as long forked tails deepen, it becomes more likely that they are aerodynamically costly..., and therefore increasingly probable that sexual rather than natural selection explains their evolution.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And of the species pairs:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... then among species with long forked tails, sexual dimorphism in tail length should increase with fork depth. Pairwise comparisons of closely related species support this prediction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h2>What of boat-tail grackles then?<\/h2>\n\n<p>From what images I could find, it looks like boat-tailed grackles appear to have graduated tails when spread. If so, then these tails would be very inefficient and males with longer tails would incur a proportionately higher cost of flight than males with shorter tails.<\/p>\n\n<p>Balmford, A., A. L. R.

It <em>arose in dogs<\/em> and was logically assumed to be of dog origin, and was first characterized in 1876. The tumor cells were/are characterized by a rearranged karyotype, which is similar in tumors from in different parts of the world. (1969) Thus it was postulated that that the transmissible agent causing the CTVT is the tumor cell itself and that all worldwide CTVT have a clonal origin. (1985)<\/p>\n\n<p>Your later question states:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What percentage / degree of genetic similarity is needed to identify something as belonging to a specific species?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>When a tumor arises in an animal (say a dog), it is automatically assumed that the cancerous cells, regardless of their ploidy, arose from that animal (in this case, a dog), not a different animal. Not all animals have had their entire genome sequenced, so this question as stated isn't answerable (although the genome of the dog has been completely sequenced). And certainly, not all tumor cell lines have been completely sequenced. The assumption of origin is made by looking at certain genes (e.g. histocompatibility genes) and others known to be species specific.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since there are relatively few transmissible <em>cancers<\/em> (that is, where the cancer itself acts as the infectious agent), this is still a safe assumption. While I'm fairly confident more transmissible cancers will be found, I'm also fairly confident that they will be species specific, because in order to escape detection, they will need to be recognized immunologically as \"self\", as they must survive in the host at least long enough to be transmitted.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the case with <em>canine transmissible venereal tumor<\/em> (CTVT). It is also the case with the contagious tumor <em>Tasmanian Devil face tumor disease<\/em> (DFTD). Just as with the canine infectious cancer, DFTD cells in different individuals have identical, complex chromosomal rearrangements and are <em>genetically identical to each other<\/em> but <em>different to the host devil<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Spread of such an infectious cell line between unrelated individuals should be prevented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I antigens on the surface of the tumour cell, as Class I molecules play a key role in self/non-self-recognition. The recent emergence of the tumor (transmitted by biting) in the endangered marsupial Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is an unfortunate exception. In the Tasmanian devil, the tumor is very aggressive and kills the host. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the case of canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), it was shown about five decades ago to be the <em>same<\/em> dog tumor being spread from dog to dog. The earliest studies were based on histological studies and karyotyping. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples still exist. More recently, with genetic analysis, it is possible to perform much more sophisticated testing on the tumor DNA.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The transmissible agent causing canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is thought to be the tumor cell itself. To test this hypothesis, we <em>analyzed genetic markers including major histocompatibility (MHC) genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood samples.<\/em> In each case, the tumor is <em>genetically distinct from its host<\/em>. Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into two subclades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that CTVT most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although CTVT is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable genotype.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Your quote <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>likely originated at least 250 years ago from a wolf or an \"old\" Asian dog breed such as a husky or Shih Tzu...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Has been disputed.

Affected plants cannot produce new cell membranes. This takes place in the grass\u2019s meristematic tissue, which explains the mushy and disintegrated growing point. [...] <\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Selectivity<\/strong> [...] Monocots (grasses) [and] dicots (broadleaves) [...] both possess ACCase enzymes in their cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Dicots have a prokaryotic form of the enzyme in the chloroplast and the eukaryotic form in the cytoplasm. Monocots have the eukaryotic form in both their cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Only production of the eukaryotic form is inhibited. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So to sum up, ACCase inhibitors act on <strong>eukaryotic ACCase<\/strong>, not the prokaryotic type. ACCase is <strong>essential for cell membrane<\/strong> formation. Blocking ACCase results in a depletion of its product, namely malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is essential for the synthesis of long fatty acids used in the cell membrane. Without cell membranes, cells lose integrity and turn to mush. Tissue growth is impossible without ACCase activity. Since monocots only have the eukaryotic ACC in both cytoplasm and chloroplasts, they die. <strong>Dicots, on the other hand, express prokaryotic ACC in their chloroplasts, making them resistant to ACCase inhibitors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>After some literature search I also found that blocking (knocking out) acetyl-CoA carboxylase in <em>Arabidopsis<\/em> (a dicotyledon) results in dead plant embryos and, hence, non-viable seeds (Baud et al., 2003). <\/p>\n","answer_id":28106,"question_id":28105,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1422436046}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28105/how-does-haloxyfop-control-young-grassy-weeds-in-fields-of-broadleaved-crops","last_activity_date":1422436046,"creation_date":1422415103,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does Haloxyfop control young grassy weeds in fields of broadleaved crops?","body":"<p>Haloxyfop <a href=\"http://www.dowagro.com/au/prod/verdict.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">(haloxyfop-P-methyl)<\/a> is a selective herbicide used to control grassy weeds in young stages.
