It is therefore very dangerous to touch the tentacles with bare hands to remove them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The toxin is a mix of different bioactive proteins which have cytolytic, cytotoxic, inflammatory or hemolytic activity. Case reports (you can find information in reference 3 about it) show that the tentacles \"burn\" though all skin layers causing immediate strong pain and lasting scars (if the victims survive) which tend to show signs of necrosis. The toxins itself paralyze the muscles of the heart and the respiration and also causes hypokalemia by hemolyzing red blood cells (one of the toxin acts as a membrane pore in the blood cells). This causes further problems and often a cardiac arrest. See reference 1 and 2 for details on the toxins. Especially 2 is interesting, as this is a PhD-Thesis on this topic with a lot of references.<\/p>\n\n<p>Treatment depends on how severe the injury is - in severe cases an antivenom can be used. Besides this typical measures are CPR, giving oxygen and removing the tentacles (with appropriate protection).

It can give false-positive results in up to 90% of experiments. However, some essay are 90% specific.<\/p>\n\n<p>That is an interesting question and there sure a lot of research done to understand specificity and strength of binding of antibody to its target.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, let me say that antibody-epitope interaction is, as many biological processes, probabilistic process, which means it can go either way, however, after binding antibody need a lot more energy or time to \"fall off\". Direct contact is always required for establishment of non-covalent bond between antibody and epitope, because characteristic length of that interaction is very low (order or angstroms, 0.1nm and less). Point here is that you don't need to run antibody in stream, rather let is sit in solution with your sample or mix gently, random thermal motion will take care of them finding each other. In flow you will waste a lot of antibody, which is expensive.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that you can estimate probability of given antibody binding given molecule from their 3D structures, but this is extremely burdensome calculation. What you can do experimentally, I suppose, is label \"right\" epitope with red fluorescent tag, and every other molecule in your solution with green tag. Then run solution through column with antibody sitting on beads (as in chromatography), elute everything and compare green to red signal. Measuring accurately, this will tell you how much \"junk\" antibody picked out of solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to numbers. <a href=\"http://www.abcam.com/primary-antibodies/high-specificity-the-fifth-rabmab-advantage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here Abcam talks<\/a> about its antibody for progesterone. Molecules, closely related to progesterone, are recognized with 40-90% efficiency, compared to true-positive target (progesterone). But this is absolute-worst case scenario, because those molecules are so closely related.<\/p>\n\n<p>On other note, antibody specificity is very important when essay is used, e.g. for HIV diagnosis. <a href=\"http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/bugdrug/antibiotic_manual/HIVtesting.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is nice page<\/a> from U Penn, that discusses issues with specificity:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, in one study of 290,000 asymptomatic Minnesota blood donors donating 630,000 blood units, the false positive rate when both the screening and confirmatory assays were positive was was 0% per donation (95% confidence interval 0% to 0.0006%).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>For example, in one study of asymptomatic Italian blood donors, only about 13% of donors with repeatedly-reactive EIA tests were confirmed to be HIV-infected on the basis of positive immunoblot. However, in a high risk population the false-positive rate can be much lower, as low as 1-3%.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I couldn't find any more precise data or studies.

Also the running environment is a good analogue to the biological environment (RAM, CPU time, disk space - as resources like food, water etc.) Genes of organism could be imagined as methods of an object like in object oriented programing. Let's define some functions:<\/p>\n\n<p>Reproduction: copies the string and creates a new instance of the organism (like a new instance of the program) - cell or an offspring - this stands for asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction takes two instances of the program and randomly exchange their functions and create a new instance with this shuffled code (recombination).<\/p>\n\n<p>Mutation: induces random changes to the string at random times. This ensures that different \"versions\" are present of the code. You need mutation for evolution to work. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also you need Selection - or rather selective pressure -  that is like changing the environment - more efficient codes will survive, the rest die of (aka crash, run out of memory (food)) etc.) Selection drives evolution forward. Also programs can interact with each other and function as a selective pressure - think of anti-virus programs and trojans or viruses - you need better and better AV programs because new viruses come out, and bad guys need new viruses because AV virus programs keep getting better and better - they both put selective pressure on the other and drive each other's evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Genetic) Variation: think of a group of softwares with similar function: like text editing. These are like different individuals of a species because they can do the same thing but they are all a bit different. These \"species\" evolve by gaining new functions by mutations (the programmer adds new code sections - mutation), and after they gain enough new function they turn into a new software - new species. Evolution takes a lot of time to produce new species - as does coding a new software :).<\/p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.<\/p>\n","answer_id":31049,"question_id":31048,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1428149333},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef6c1e9a540c28587fe777f9bcf907af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1231/mcm","reputation":7783,"display_name":"MCM"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic4na.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14735,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14735/nandor-poka","reputation":2578,"display_name":"Nandor Poka","accept_rate":75},"score":0,"post_id":31050,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428107532,"comment_id":51813,"body":"I&#39;m happy to see that someone came from the hardware point of view :) I really like your examples."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef6c1e9a540c28587fe777f9bcf907af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1231,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1231/mcm","reputation":7783,"display_name":"MCM"},"score":0,"post_id":31050,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ic4na.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14735,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14735/nandor-poka","reputation":2578,"display_name":"Nandor Poka","accept_rate":75},"edited":false,"creation_date":1428115744,"comment_id":51816,"body":"@poka.nandor Thanks. :-)"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1428115850,"creation_date":1428104815,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Evolution<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Evolution<\/em><\/strong> is the accumulation of genetic mutations that results in phenotypic variation (physical characteristics) where surviving variations are more suited to the environment the organism lives in, thus allowing it to survive better and -- <strong>critically<\/strong> -- reproduce as-good-as or better-than its competing organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of computer science this would be like a starting with basic CPU design with all the absolute necessities. Now, let's pretend every generation of CPU after your first is going to be randomly designed by something called \"Pressure OS\". Pressure OS doesn't care if the CPUs it designs match the needs of the consumer. PrOS is unfeeling. An OS of pure logic. <strong>ALL<\/strong> it will do is make a bunch of random ones, note which ones sell the best, and make the best-selling ones to be the template for its next round of random designs.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Selection and Variation<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Selection<\/em><\/strong> is the process by which environmental pressures (low moisture, high heat, high altitude, available food, extreme pressures at the bottom of oceanic trenches, etc.) dictate how well each successive generation of organisms survive.<\/p>\n\n<p>In our analogy, the Pressure OS is the cause of Selection. Some CPU designs aren't going to meet the needs of consumers (first-gen Atoms which could barely operate a toaster). Those ones won't be produced again. Others will be very successful (like the Pentium-4 Series which lasted for years) and will quickly outnumber the inferior ones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some designs, as odd as they are, will find success in areas outside enthusiast desktops or workstations. Like ARM designs which were never part of the desktop market, but found lots of success in phones and business devices.<\/p>\n\n<p>Market requirements/environments, as met by the random variations produced by Pressure OS, created <strong><em>Variation<\/em><\/strong> in the types of CPUs available.<\/p>\n\n<p>ARM Snapdragons could never, <em>ever<\/em> compete in the desktop enthusiast market. That's the realm of Sandy Bridges, Haswells, Semprons, and Phenoms. Then again, they're dramatically different designs -- which stem from common designs decades ago that have been heavily modified over the years -- that don't need to compete. Snapdragons and Semprons can co-exist because they fill different niches.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, when consumer needs change again -- if everybody gets tired of mobile phones, tablets, and desktops in favor of cone-shaped personal assistants which go in your ear -- then designs will change again under that new pressure. Eventually CPU one design will become the standard for that particular piece of hardware, and you could say that CPU <strong>variation<\/strong> had <strong>evolved<\/strong> to get there via <strong>selective pressure<\/strong> from consumers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biology operates in the exact same way, except the selection process is instigated by environmental pressures to produce organism variations that can successfully reproduce.

A substance is soluble in water when its solid form (such as a sugar cube) completely dissolves in water to become a sugar solution. The sugar molecules themselves are unaffected, essentially - instead of all being bound to one another in a crystal, they are now floating around in the water.

At the beginning of mitosis the duplicated centrosomes separate and migrate to oppsite sites of the nucleus to form the poles of the mitotic spindle.

This means that those regions are more active at the genomic level (i.e. higher gene expression, gene regulation and higher TF binding) and are less prone to form nucleosomes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Histone mark sites are DNA regions known to bind certain type of histones and therefore also influences the chromatin conformation leading to the same effects described previously. <strong>The critical point is that the histones you are listing do not primarily bind a specific DNA sequence (as described by @mdperry) but rather DNA sequence marked by epigenetic modifications such as methylation and acetylation<\/strong>.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now for your first questions, SNPs in DNAse hypersensitive regions might influence the chromatin state and therefore yes might influence gene expression and gene regulation. Will those SNPs also influence TF binding? Well they might indirectly via chromatin modifications. They will not directly act on TF binding if not located in a sequence known to bind TFs (TFBS). DNAse hypersensitivity is not a synonym for transcription factor binding regions/sequences.<\/p>\n\n<p>For your second question, SNPs in histone mark sites are a little bit more difficult to interpret. They might, or might not, provoke chromatin changes by influencing the binding of histones but not in a direct way. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site\" rel=\"nofollow\">CpG islands<\/a> are, for example, DNA regions known to be greatly under the influence of epigenetic marks and therefore mutations in those specific regions (e.g. a C -> T mutation) might influence the relative methylation/acetylation state and therefore the binding of histones. SNPs might therefore influence gene expression via chromatin changes which leads to higher/lower TF binding but again not in a direct way. Here again a SNP would influence TF binding directly only if the mutation is located in a TFBS. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see my answer is full of \"might\" and the reason is that it is very difficult, at the current state-of-the-art, to determine the exact impact of a SNP on the 3D conformation of the chromatin and therefore predict the effect on specific gene expressions.<\/p>\n\n<p>An advice would be to try to co-localize your SNPs with known TFBS either predicted <em>In-silico<\/em> or measured via CHiP-SEQ experiments and merge that with the information about DNAse hyperactivity and histone marks you already gathered. For example a SNP in a TFBS in a DNAse hyperactive region is very likely to have a greater impact than a SNP in a TFBS in a non active region.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am sorry I cannot be more specific but this is a very active research area in genetics and there is still a lot to understand, especially for the interactions between all the players influencing the chromatin conformation.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30972,"question_id":30940,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1428024669}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30940/snps-in-dnase-hypersensitive-and-histone-marks-sites","last_activity_date":1428024669,"creation_date":1427809826,"answer_count":2,"title":"SNPs in DNase hypersensitive and histone marks sites","body":"<p>I am investigating a role of SNPs in DNase hypersensitive sites and in the DNA regions of histone marks and have some questions about it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>SNPs in DNase hypersensitive sites<\/strong> might mean that those SNPs are in enhancer regions and might influence TF binding affinity what can influence a transcriptional output.

We're talking about <em>Hardy-Weinberg<\/em> equilibriums in the allele frequencies. However, with populations large enough true equilibriums are impractical to reach.<\/p>\n\n<p>The more pragmatic explanation is that more mutations will arise, they'll be passed around, rare mutations will see more exposure, and humanity - <strong>in a very general sense<\/strong> - becomes <em>more diverse<\/em> genetically until a <em>Selective Pressure<\/em> is applied. Until there's a detriment to having a particular gene, there isn't a need to eliminate it from the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your example is children who are too weak at birth to live outside of an NICU for their first few months - well, because we're capable of providing such care, until that care goes away it's not negatively affecting us. If it comes with an additional cost - say that, for whatever reason, premies can't digest mother's milk until the 8-month mark, then Natural Selection would pressure humans to evolve so that only 8+ month or older babies are born.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's no evidence of significant pressures in human populations at this time, though.

While there are detriments <em>associated<\/em> with being born prematurely, and some evidence that women waiting until they're late 30's and men until they're 60 or older can negatively affect their gametes and consequently the development of any children born from them - it's been such a short time since the introduction of hormonal contraception and modern medicine that we may not see results tangible results for hundreds of years. Although condoms have been around for several hundred years, and there's been no associations with condom use that I can think of.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the short term, what it has done is affect the ethnic diversity of countries. For the first time ever, Hispanic births have outnumbered Caucasian births in 2012 in the United States. Other countries, mostly European countries, are seeing declines in birth rates - which means their populations will decline with age or be compensated for by immigration. Higher birth rates, however, are associated with lower income brackets or very religious communities - both of which are associated with ethnic Minorities, at least in the United States. So while minority populations have more kids, they do so on fewer resources which may negatively affect their children in the long-term, whereas higher-earning segments of the population might have fewer children later in their lives, but can provide a much more stable environment and opportunities to continue that success.<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing that hormone-centered birth control has done, however, is eliminate rape as a viable form of passing on one's genes. As gruesome as it might be to consider, pregnancies as a result of rape can produce \"fit\" offspring. It is a legitimate reproductive strategy in nature, and is in humans... <em>unless<\/em> the woman is using contraception. In the long-term this will probably show some interesting results (nominally an enhanced <strong>\"Female Choice\"<\/strong> effect - which is already evident in human evolution), but nothing right now.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also worth considering the ability for humans' increasing abilities to manipulate our own genome. At this point, we're nearly able to remove detrimental genes at-will and replace them with more effective versions. Because of this bio-engineering ability, the generations after ours might never be susceptible to inherited diseases - or they might all hop on the trendy \"genes\" and end up completely identical to each other. That's part of the fun of being human, though; we're very messy when it comes to Evolution. We tend to muck things but up good. :)<\/p>\n","answer_id":5209,"question_id":5202,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/820708496/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":15194,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15194/user3407","reputation":22,"display_name":"user3407"},"score":-3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":1,"post_id":31014,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428010500,"comment_id":51707,"body":"This is highly speculative and doesn&#39;t answer the question."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxxEx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13072,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13072/corvus","reputation":1501,"display_name":"Corvus"},"score":0,"post_id":31014,"edited":false,"creation_date":1428013282,"comment_id":51715,"body":"It also seems to muddle up genetic evolution evolution and cultural evolution, let alone the complexities of gene-culture co-evolution."}],"down_vote_count":3,"last_activity_date":1428010195,"creation_date":1428010195,"body":"<p>Well , Ime sorry but sometimes a question have to be rephrased in order to reach the ''elefant in the room''  : The important question is if the existence of contraceptives in itself wil change the direction  of human evolution . After the invention of contraceptives the meaning of ''survival of the fittest'' is something very different , from now on the RESISTANCE to the effect of contraceptives becomes the dominant factor in determining fitness for suvival .\n This resistance can be compared to the resistance develped by a population of insects being subjected to a targeted poison :  before or later the population will develop some kind of resistance , even in cases where this can only be achieved by a complicated and indirect mecanism .\n  Humans can achieve such resistance in several ways easy to imagine , and probably also in others very hard to imagine .\n The most obvious is by cultural adabtion , by developing a culture that prevents the efects of contraceptives . This can already be seen in the demografic growth of several population groups dominated by strict compliance with a beliefsystem damning contraceptives... . Many would argue that this has nothing to do with genetics , but actually a very strong case can be made for the opposite position .<br>\n A less obvious way to devellop resistance is selection for a maternal or parental instinct , operating seperately from the sexual drive which has been ''poisoned'' .  In any population , even with an extemely low birthrate , there will always be a few individuals who will have lots of children , no matter what .  Given time enough ,and especially in a low-bithrate population , this behavour will be selected again and again until the underlying genetic mecanism  will cause it to be come  truely hereditary .  Such is the lessons of  selective breeding towards a derirable quality in  everything from horses to tomatoes , and there are  no reason to believe  humans to be different .

Instead of seeing it as the brain influences our fine motor skill, think of it the other way round. The way we use our hands or any other part of our body sends feedback to the brain to increase the portion of the brain devoted to that region of the body and of course with disuse the reverse occurs. The more you do a certain task the more that portion of the brain gets better and coordinating the movement. The portion I talk about is the primary and supplementary motor cortices. So basically we are specialising. In the same way a heart doctor is better with treating conditions of the heart than a foot doctor. So we can either devote our experience to the one hand, or both or the other hand. If we use both hands equally our brain adapts so that we are ambidextrous, if instead we use just the one hand our brain develops just that side. But if you do focus on both you are using your dominant hand less so overall same amount of development just over both sides of the brain rather than just one side. You can probably see the benefit of having this plasticity of improving only what is used because why improve what we don't use and waste resources? And you may also see the benefits of higher specialising of one hand rather than having two slightly specialised hands. There are few tasks that require both hands to be very specialised, but if that were the case then the body would go ahead and do that but in spending time training your hands you are probably training your legs or something else less.<\/p>\n\n<p>///<\/p>\n\n<p>Why not have a switch between the two hemispheres to give the hand currently being used the fine motor skill located in the other hemisphere? (from comment)<\/p>\n\n<p>I see. In my answer I only talked about one aspect. The brain doesn't have to learn skills for each hand completely independently. For example imagine if you learn to play a musical piece with your right hand only. If you try it with your left you won't be amazing but you'll definitely be better than a complete novice. Our brain can learn how to do by seeing which is vital for development. But there's a limit to that, your hands aren't completely identical so there's still a portion that needs fine tuning. Your muscles have different stregth, fatigue, resistance, recruitment patterns, places they innervate. Your hands are mirror images. The weight of your hand is different. And not only that but these variables aren't fixed, there's lots of them and they are different for different tasks. So to use your analogy, the more expensive remote can be used but it wasn't bought for use with the black plane. It'll give more control to the black plane but it still won't be the best ever until it learns what the muscle strength is etc. then it will be just as great. <\/p>\n","answer_id":14866,"question_id":14808,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1391715292}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14808/why-arent-we-ambidextrous","last_activity_date":1427948605,"creation_date":1391452915,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why aren't we ambidextrous?","body":"<p>It seems so simple that if my brain can tell my right hand to do something, then it should be able to tell equally well to the left ?

When you say stretching, I hope you mean dynamic as opposed to static stretching especially if you are about to compete in a sport.

The findings of this study agree with that recommendation for agility activities as well. This study supported the use of dynamic stretching in eliciting the greatest performance in agility movements by decreased T-Drill time. The findings\n  of the current study are consistent with those of Fletcher and Jones (2004), and Young and Behm (2003) who determined that dynamic stretching elicits the best performance in power and high-speed activities <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1691&amp;context=etd\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a>. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, static stretching does not improve performance and can actually lead to injury.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The current study found static stretching to have a negative effect on agility, and acceleration (Fletcher &amp; Jones, 2004; Nelson et al., 2005). As acceleration is a component of agility, these findings support those of Fletcher and Jones (2004) and Nelson et al. (2005). Agility also involves components of braking, and change of direction.

If the temperature changes very slowly, for example at a rate of less than 0.5 °C per minute, then a person can be unaware of a 4-5 °C change in temperature, provided that the temperature of the skin remains within the neutral thermal region of 30-36 °C. If the temperature changes more rapidly, such as at 0.1 °C/s, then small decreases and increases in skin temperature are detected.

We are far from a complete understanding of how memory is stored and recalled. Nonetheless, we do know a <em>little<\/em>, so read on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your understanding of basic neural function is <em>almost<\/em> correct. First, an individual neuron will signal through its single axon onto the dendrites of many downstream neurons, not the other way around. Second, I am not sure what you mean by \"focusing them based on their permutations,\" but it is true that neural information can undergo many transformations as it propagates through a circuit. Third, if there is a behavioral outcome of the network activity like a muscle response or hormone release, those effects are mediated by nerves communicating with muscles and hormone-releasing cells. I'm not sure if that is what you meant by \"focused response mechanism.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, as you have discovered, the analogy of neural circuits to electrical circuits is relatively poor at any reasonably sophisticated level of analysis. My opinion is that biological systems are often poorly served by being framed as engineering problems. Others will disagree with that, but I think understanding a biological system on its own terms makes many things much clearer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key thing missing from the electrical circuit analogy turns out to be one of the keys to understanding information storage in neural circuits--<em>the synapse<\/em>, the site where one neuron communicates with another. The synapse transforms the electrical signal from the upstream neuron into a chemical signal. That chemical signal is then converted back into an electrical signal by the downstream neuron. <\/p>\n\n<p>The strength of the synapse can be adjusted in a long-term way by changing the level of protein expression--this is called <strong>long-term potentiation (LTP)<\/strong> or <strong>long-term depression (LTD)<\/strong>. LTP and LTD therefore can regulate the ease with which information can flow along a particular path. As a basic example (that should not be taken too seriously), imagine a set of neurons that represents \"New York City\" and another set of neurons that represents \"My Friend John.\" If you then happen to be in New York City with your friend John, both of those groups of neurons will be active and synapses <em>between<\/em> these two networks will be strengthened because they are co-active (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory\">Hebbian plasticity<\/a>). In this way, the idea of NYC and the idea of John are now bound together.<\/p>\n\n<p>Where are these neurons that represent NYC and John? We are still not totally clear on this, and the question is complicated because there are many different types of memory. For instance, your memory of how to ride a bike (procedural memory) is not treated the same as your memory of what you ate for breakfast (episodic memory). However, a best current answer is that the <strong>hippocampus<\/strong> and its associated regions are important for the initial encoding of memories and the <strong>neocortex<\/strong> is where longer term memories are stored. There is substantial communication between these two areas so that memories can be effectively adjusted over time.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Update<\/h2>\n\n<p>In response to Jule's comment asking for some resources, I realize it is important to make the point that the Hebbian model I outlined hasn't been definitively shown. Like with all aspects of neuroscience, there is a lot of good work at the molecular and cellular level and good work at the behavioral level, but the causal link between the two is not so clear.

If you drop a human in water we will instinctively flap around and try too keep our head out of the water in about as elegant a way as a dog. The main problem for humans is panicking. Someone who does not know how to swim is likely to panic and <em>not<\/em> manage to keep their head out of the water. Remember that humans float in water, if you keep calm you should be able to keep your head above the water line easily enough. <\/p>\n\n<p>Dogs can't swim as such, they simply do the same motions in the water as they do on land. There is no different action happening, they don't instinctively do a breast stroke.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, human infants actually have a couple of instincts that make them \"swim\" (<a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/237480-can-newborn-babies-swim/\">source<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Diving Reflex<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>The diving reflex, or bradycardic response, means that infants whose heads are submerged in water will naturally hold their breath. Their heart rate will also slow down while they are underwater. This reflex disappears after about six months of age.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Swimming Reflex<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Newborns placed stomach-side down in water will move their arms and\n  legs in a repetitive \"swimming\" motion.

There are two types of MHC.<\/p>\n\n<p>MHC type one is present on all of our cells with a nucleus. The purpose of these protein complexes is called antigen presentation. T-cells cannot recognize free antigens on their own, it has to be presented to them in the proper way. This is what these proteins do. In every cell there are lots and lots of proteins, that get digested to small polypeptides (short aminoacid sequences) by proteases during the natural recycling process. The cell takes a small portion of these polypeptides and presents them on its surface through MHC I complexes, that the immune system can read. This is like the cell saying to the immune syytem that \"hey I got these proteins in me\". Now if the cell is infected (by a virus most likely) then the \"attacker's\" proteins get digested and presented as well and its like saying \" hey I'm infected and the attacker has these proteins\". <\/p>\n\n<p>MHC II serves similar function but it is only present on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). These complexes present peptides derived from proteins consumed and digested through phagocytosis or receptor mediated endocytosis.

I don't think it has as much to do with the refractive index of water but rather the shape of our corneas and the loss of this shape advantage under water, for if the eyes are protected by goggles, one can see quite clearly underwater (much the same as a camera can, as the shape of it's lenses are not affected). Any change in the shape of the cornea changes the way light passes through the eye, and results in a change in vision.

It is more interesting than that.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"small improvement\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The conception that evolution proceed through \"small improvements\" is either partially wrong or totally wrong.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, because of the loaded term \"improvement\". Evolution can yield a population to have a lower mean reproductive success or a lower complexity, things that you could eventually see as deterioration.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, because changes not need to necessarily be small. Some mutations have a very big effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Third, because even small deleterious mutations can spread in the population and reach fixation (=and all individuals carry this mutation), just because of the joint effect of other evolutionary processes such as genetic drift. This post may help you to get a quick grasp of what <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14543/why-is-the-strength-of-genetic-drift-inversely-proportional-to-the-population-si\">genetic drift<\/a> is.

It is way more than that. We've been working on the subject a lot since Darwin and today we have a much much better understanding of evolutionary processes than Darwin at its time. Everything is not fully understood yet and therefore there are still many people researching to better understand evolution. Of course, not to better test if evolution is true as this has been known for a long time now.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30911,"question_id":30852,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30852/evolution-theory-roses-spikes-being-more-bulgy-doesnt-give-you-advantage","last_activity_date":1427730329,"creation_date":1427558701,"answer_count":2,"title":"Evolution theory - roses spikes - being more bulgy doesn't give you advantage","body":"<p>I've seen spike, huge spike.

Such plasticity can be viewed as adaptive when associated\n  with a gain in function [...] or as maladaptive when associated with negative consequences [...]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Your vision example, however, is more appropriately referred to as <em>adaptation<\/em>. Although it strictly spoken falls under the above definition of plasticity (...reorganizing its... function,  color adaptation is (at least in my opinion) too short-lived (minutes) to be associated with plasticity.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as to experiments - Although learning a chunk of material from a textbook as a homework assignment is definitely related to plasticity, it cannot be seen as proof; it is the result of neuroplasticity. Experiments showing plasticity can and have been done with imaging (most notably fMRI) or with electrophysiological approaches (patch clamp studies showing long-term potentiation reflecting learning).

Soon afterwards, a simple BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search revealed exact matches to the mature let-7 miRNA sequence in the emerging Drosophila melanogaster and human genomes. It is now known that mature let-7 is highly conserved across animal species.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The let-7 family of miRNAs is often present in multiple copies in a genome (Table 1). To distinguish between multiple isoforms, a letter is placed after let-7 to indicate a let-7 with a slightly different sequence, and a number at the end denotes that the same sequence is present in multiple genomic locations. For example, humans have ten mature let-7-family sequences (Figure 3) that are produced from 13 precursor sequences (Figure 4). Three separate precursors produce the mature let-7a sequence (let-7a-1, let-7a-2 and let-7a-3) and precursors from two different genomic locations produce the let-7f (let-7f-1 and let-7f-2) sequence. However, the size of the family can differ between organisms.

Often adapted polyploids can undergo a proces that is called diploidization, during which genomic redundancy is removed. This means extra copies of genes will undergo less negative selection. Meaning alleles containing deleterious mutations at functionally important nucleotides are selected against. This allows more mutational freedom, leading to what is called subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization: new genes are created with slightly different or new functions. Other redundant genes are lost or become inactivated (pseudogenes). <\/p>\n\n<p>Another example of benefits from polyploidy, this time not in an evolutionary, but in a more individual context, is the fenomenon called hybrid vigor or heterosis. Heterosis is a phenomenon in which a polyploid offspring of two diploid parents is more healthy and vigorous than its progenitors. One of the factors explaining this could be due to a protection against recessive characters, as being homozygous as a polyploid is even more 'uncommon'.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30882,"question_id":30836,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30836/why-does-polyploidy-give-an-evolutionary-advantage","last_activity_date":1427649538,"creation_date":1427466662,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why does polyploidy give an evolutionary advantage?","body":"<p>I would like to know what advantages polyploidy holds.

I think that the reason people tend to stick to one ligand/one receptor models is that they capture all the intuition without the tedious algebra. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's interesting that you are asking for the fraction of <em>ligand<\/em> bound to receptors ($[RL]/[L]_{tot}$). Typically one is interested in the fraction of <em>receptors<\/em> that have ligand bound ($[RL]/[R]_{tot}$). This is for two reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Typically the fraction of bound receptor is the physiologically relevant variable for a cell, determining the response of the cells to the ligand stimulus. Since the cell can only sense the concentration of ligand when it binds to the receptor, the fraction of bound receptor is the natural variable to study.<\/li>\n<li>In most contexts, the number of receptors is much smaller than the number of ligands. This motivates the approximation found in pretty much all treatments of receptor-ligand equilibrium that <em>the concentration of receptor-ligand complex is negligible compared to the total concentration of ligand<\/em>. For cells, this is a fairly reasonable assumption. In this limit, the fraction of ligands bound to receptors ($[RL]/[L]_{tot}$) is always negligible. It's the fraction $[RL]/[R]_{tot}$ that is  interesting. Another reason this assumption might be adopted is that in practice, ligands tend to be soluble while receptors are insoluble. In this case, it is easier to control the concentration of ligand, adding it in excess to a pellet of receptors, and then measure the amount of bound receptors (maybe by radioactivity): in this experiment the total concentration of receptors is <em>measured,<\/em> not controlled, so you want your equation to be a function of your controlled variable, the concentration of ligand. This requires adopting the approximation above.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The situation in which there are two ligands binding to one receptor has been solved (in the limit that $[RL]\\ll[L]_{tot}$): this case is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_inhibition\">competitive inhibition<\/a>. In your notation, the fraction of receptor 1 bound to ligand 1 (ligand 2 is the \"competitive inhibitor,\" i.e. rival ligand):<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{tot}} = \\frac{[L_1]}{[L_1]+K_{11}(1+\\frac{[L_2]}{K_{12}})}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>So I'm going to generalize to the case that there are $N$ ligands and I am interested in the fraction of a given receptor $R_i$ bound to ligand $L_j$. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{ij}\\equiv [R_i][L_j]/[R_iL_j]$. <\/p>\n\n<p>The receptor is also binding to all the other ligands, so that the free concentration of receptor $[R_i]$ is equal to the difference between the total receptor concentration $[R_i]_{tot}$ and the concentration of each bound complex $[R_iL_k]$ for $k$ from 1 to $N$. And the ligand is also binding to all the other receptors. In order to get a reasonable equation, we have to invoke an approximation very similar in spirit to the one mentioned above, namely, that <em>the concentration of all ligand-receptor complexes is small compared to the total concentration of each ligand individually.<\/em> Thus I can ignore the difference between $[L_j]_{free}$ and $[L_j]_{tot}$. <\/p>\n\n<p>In this approximation, I expand out the expression for the equilibrium constant (using $[L_j]$ as shorthand to stand for $[L_j]_{tot}$).<\/p>\n\n<p>$$K_{ij} = \\frac{([R_i]_{tot}-[R_iL_j]-\\sum_{k\\neq j}^{N}[R_iL_k])[L_j]}{[R_iL_j]}=\\frac{[R_i]_{tot}[L_j]}{[R_iL_j]}-[L_j]-\\sum_{k\\neq j}^N\\frac{L_kK_{ij}}{K_{ik}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the sum is over $k$ from 1 to $N$ <em>except<\/em> $k=j$, which I pulled out of the sum early. I also used the definition of each dissociation constant to write the sum in terms of dissociation constants instead of $[R_iL_k]$, which makes the algebra a lot simpler.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can then be simplified to solve for the fraction of bound receptors:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{[R_iL_j]}{[R_i]_{tot}} = \\frac{[L_j]}{[L_j]+K_{ij}(1+\\sum_{k\\neq j}^N\\frac{[L_k]}{K_{ik}})}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose instead of being interested in the fraction of receptor $i$ bound to a particular ligand $j$, one is interested in the fraction of receptor $i$ bound to <em>any<\/em> ligand. I'll call this quantity $[R_i\\mathbf{L}]/[R_i]_{tot}$. We can figure this out by noting that <\/p>\n\n<p>$$[R_i\\mathbf{L}]\\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^N[R_iL_k] = [R_i]_{tot} - [R_i]_{free}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>We obtain $[R_i]_{free}$ from the formula for each $K_d$:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$[R_i]_{free}\\equiv[R_i] = \\frac{K_{ij}[R_iL_j]}{[L]_j}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>And so using our equation for $[R_iL_j]$, we obtain (I'll spare you some of the gory algebra details)<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{[R_i\\mathbf{L}]}{[R_i]_{tot}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^N\\frac{[L]_k}{K_{ik}}}{1+\\sum_{k=1}^N\\frac{[L]_k}{K_{ik}}}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>(these sums are again unrestricted, from $k=1$ to $N$ including $k=j$). <\/p>\n\n<p>Happily, if there is only one ligand, these formula reduce to the regular result, namely $[L_1]/([L_1]+K_{i1})$. As another check, if all the $K_d$s are equal, then the fraction of receptors bound to <em>any<\/em> type of ligand is the same as the bound fraction for the same amount of a <em>single<\/em> type of ligand with the same concentration as the whole pool of different ligands ($\\sum_{k=1}^N[L_k]$), and the fraction of receptor bound to a particular ligand $L_j$ is smaller by the fraction of the total ligand pool that is species $j$, $[L_j]/\\sum_{k=1}^N[L_k]$.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are really interested in the fraction of <em>ligands<\/em> bound to receptors---that is, you are working in the limit in which there are tons of receptors compared to ligands, so that the number of receptor-ligand complexes is tiny compared to the number of receptors---then you can use the above equations just by switching $L$'s and $R$'s. In this case you would obtain<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{[R_iL_j]}{[L_j]_{tot}} = \\frac{[R_i]}{[R_i]+K_{ij}(1+\\sum_{k\\neq i}^{N}\\frac{[R_k]}{K_{kj}})}\\qquad [R_i]\\equiv[R_i]_{free}\\approx[R_i]_{tot}$$<\/p>\n\n<h2>A caveat<\/h2>\n\n<p>To derive these equations, I made a pretty strong assumption that the total concentration of <em>all<\/em> receptor-ligand complexes (for different receptors as well as different ligands) is small compared to the total concentration of each ligand individually. In this limit, we can assume that the pools of free ligands of each species are so large that each receptor equilibrates with this pool independently of each other receptor (there's plenty of ligands to go around). You might be interested in the limit in which ligand binding and unbinding to one receptor affects the binding and unbinding to another receptors, so that receptors are not independent. I am not sure how to approach this problem. I'm skeptical that there will be any sort of closed form solution; in my preliminary thinking about this limit, I think I can imagine situations in which stationary equilibria are not possible: depending on rates, receptor A might partially equilibrate, depleting the pool of ligands, affecting the equilibration of receptor B, which would cause receptor B to \"pull\" more ligands away from A, in some sort of oscillation. However, that is just speculation, and I'd be very curious if someone could provide more insight to this case, in which receptors are able to \"interact\" through the pool of free ligand.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the take-aways of this whole analysis is that it is very helpful to be aware of the assumptions made in standard derivations that lead to the nice results we learn in biochemistry class, and how those assumptions might have to change if we generalize the system somewhat. <\/p>\n","answer_id":30877,"question_id":30862,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1427624136}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30862/is-there-a-formula-for-determining-the-of-ligand-bound-to-a-given-receptor-in","last_activity_date":1427624136,"creation_date":1427583288,"answer_count":1,"title":"Is there a formula for determining the % of ligand bound to a given receptor in a mixture with multiple ligands and receptors?","body":"<p>When a ligand and receptor interact with a given kd, one can easily determine % of ligand bound to the receptor when the kd, total concentration of ligand, and total concentration of receptor are known.

This in short affects the fermentation process (\"an increase of SNF increases the duration of the fermentation process\").<\/p>\n\n<p>-The next step is homogenization, which prevents milk fat from rising to the top of the liquid.  This has an effect on the stability of the emulsion.<\/p>\n\n<p>-I think this step is where \"sterility\" comes into play, \"heat treatment of milk reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms to safe limits for the consumer\u2019s health. Various heat treatments can be applied, which are classified based on the duration and the temperature. The most common are known as thermalization, low and high pasteurization, sterilization and UHT (Ultra Heat Treatment).\"  The review goes into more detail about each type and what they eliminate or don't eliminate (spores, vegetative bacteria, etc.).  <\/p>\n\n<p>-The fermentation process is the most important one for developing flavor and texture.  The two live bacterial strains of <em>Streptococcus salivarius<\/em> subsp. <em>thermophilus<\/em> (ST) and <em>Lactobacillus delbrueckii<\/em> subsp. <em>bulgaricus<\/em> (LB) are the two most basic strains used in yogurt.  LB is what metabolizes lactose into lactic acid and LB and ST acting in synergy is what causes a decrease in milk pH.  \"When the pH of the yogurt approaches 5.0, activity of ST subsides and LB gradually dominates the overall fermentation process until the target value of pH is reached and the fermentation process ceases. Normally, the fermentation period is terminated by lowering the temperature to 4 °C. At this temperature, the culture is still alive, but its activity is drastically limited to allow controlled flavor during storage and distribution.\"  I think to answer your question, yogurt manufacturers probably have a very sensitive gauge for pH and can control temperature fluctuations finely to maintain yogurt pH and flavor (not too sour).  \"After the pH of yogurt reaches the value of 4.7\u20134.3, the yogurt is cooled to around 5 °C. This inhibits the growth and metabolic reaction of the starter culture and prevents the rise in acidity. Cooling of yogurt can be in one or two phases. One-phase cooling involves the rapid decrease of the coagulum temperature to less than 10 °C, where the fermentation process is inhibited leading to yogurt with low viscosity. Two-phase cooling is initiated by rapidly decreasing the temperature to less than 20 °C and then gradually reaching the storage temperature of 5 °C leading to yogurt with an increased viscosity and limited syneresis. This is quite common in the yogurt manufacture process, especially when fruits are to be added.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read about the other innovative methods involved in yogurt making such as: Ultra High Pressure (UHP) which inactivates pathogens and microorganisms that cause milk to spoil, High Intensity Ultrasonication and Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) which all can reduce microbial content.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that some DIY yogurt instructions mention that if you ferment longer and/or in warm temperatre the more sour it will be so to reduce how sour it is, either ferment it less and/or start fermentation at a lower temperature <a href=\"http://nourishedkitchen.com/troubleshooting-homemade-yogurt-questions/\">(source)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sfakianakis P, Tzia C.

With regard to electrical stimuli it is <strong>current density<\/strong> that determines safety limits. Therefore, in medical devices, it is not a matter of what is a safe maximum <em>current level<\/em>, but what is the maximum safe current level given the surface of the electrode? And in terms of skin stimulation, it is not the safety limit that is the bottle neck, but the <strong>maximum tolerable current density<\/strong>, which is around 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2<\/sup> (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169409X9500081H\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prausnitz, 1996<\/a>). Higher stimuli result in pain sensations. This is one of the reasons why the <a href=\"http://www.wicab.com/en_us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BrainPort<\/a> device is used on the tongue; the moist surface reduces impedance and hence the currrent needed to elicit a tactile response.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Permanent damage<\/em><\/strong>.

The best-possible tactile \"resolution\" is generally expressed in terms of <strong>tactile acuity<\/strong>. Tactile acuity varies across body sites, and unfortunately it is about the worst on the thigh (45 mm) and the back (40 mm). A much cited picture on tactile acuities is the following from Weinstein (<a href=\"http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9780805829419/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1968<\/a>):<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wnkvd.png\" alt=\"2-point discrimination thresholds\"><\/p>\n\n<p>These acuities represent the distance in which 2 simultaneously presented, static pressure points need to be spaced to be <em>just noticeable<\/em> (the so called two-point discrimination threshold). Although your proposed electric stimuli are different from pressure stimuli, these reported values in the figure (40 - 45 mm) give an impression on the inter-electrode distance needed. From my own work I can confirm the ~40 mm using vibratory stimuli. The unfavorable acuity of the back and external bodily skin in general was also one of the rasons to put the electrode grid of the BrainPort on the tongue, which has excellent tactile acuity.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n - <a href=\"https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/9626/file_1.pdf?sequence=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaczmareck et al. <em>IEEE Trans Biomed Eng<\/em> 1991;<strong>38<\/strong>:1-16<\/a><br>\n - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169409X9500081H\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prausnitz, <em>Adv Drug Delivery Rev 1996<\/em>;<strong>18<\/strong>:395-425<\/a><br>\n - <a href=\"http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9780805829419/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weinstein S. 1968.

There is no segregation, no independent assortment, no linkage (that you can measure--the genes are still arrayed along their chromosomes). Each mother cell divides to give two perfect copies of itself.

It was originally believed that both positive\n  and negative autoregulations are achieved exclusively by the action of\n  CI dimers at the PRM-OR-PR sequence of the phage genome (1, 10) (Fig.\n  1A), based on the following observations. (i) There is a hierarchy of\n  intrinsic binding affinities of a CI dimer to individual operators\n  sites: OR1 > OR2 > OR3 (11\u201317); (ii) CI bound to the intrinsically\n  weak OR2 site is strengthened by cooperative interactions with CI\n  bound to the stronger adjacent OR1 site, and the ensemble of two CI\n  dimers at the OR1 ∼ OR2 sites represses PR and activates PRM (13, 16)\n  (Fig. 1A); (iii) at high CI concentrations, a CI dimer can bind to the\n  weakest operator site, OR3, repressing PRM (1, 2) (Fig. 1C).\n  Incidentally, a second pair of CI dimers binds cooperatively to OL1 ∼\n  OL2, and represses PL (7).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>CI binding affects transcription of Lambda phage DNA through several mechanisms, including DNA looping between the OR operator sites at the Prm/Pr promoters and OL operator sites at the Pl promoter. The behaviour of an engineered transcription system derived from Lambda phage thus depends on whether the possibility of DNA looping between these sites are retained.<\/p>\n\n<p>The discussion section gives addditional exposition:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our study confirmed several predictions of previous investigators\n  discussed above about the mechanism of autoactivation and\n  autorepression of PRM by measuring in vitro transcription on\n  supercoiled DNA templates containing different combinations of\n  operator mutations. Our transcription data support the model that\n  autoactivation requires CI binding to OR2, and that activation is\n  stimulated by cooperative dimer\u2013dimer and tetramer\u2013 tetramer\n  interactions between CI molecules at OR2 and those bound to other\n  operator subsites. First, cooperative interactions of CI not only\n  occur between OR1 and OR2 in cis, as reported previously, but also\n  between OR1 ∼ OR2 and OL1 ∼ OL2 in trans, resulting in individual site\n  occupancies at lower CI concentrations as judged by their effects on\n  PRM activation. The trans-cooperativity by octamer formation requires\n  adjacent CI binding sites between OR1 ∼ OR2∕OL1 ∼ OL2 or OR1 ∼ OR2∕OL2\n  ∼ OL3 and not OR1 ∼ OR2 and OL1 ∼ OL3 (Fig. S3 F and J). Similar\n  trans-cooperativity between OR3 and OL3 is inferred from PRM\n  repression at lower CI concentrations. Cooperative interactions lead\n  to DNA looping when they occur between CI at OL and OR sites. PRM is\n  autorepressed by the binding of CI to OR3 as reported previously\n  (1\u20133), and this is stimulated by dimer\u2013dimer and tetramer\u2013tetramer\n  interactions that occur through DNA looping. Our results are in\n  agreement with Revet et al. (18) that looping per se strengthens the\n  binding of CI to the suboperators (Fig. 5). Our work provided\n  quantitative evaluation of the contribution of each operator to\n  autoregulation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you wish to accurately model the system described by Huang et al., I would look very closely at the circuit sequence and determine which parts of the lambda phage system are actually present.

The lambda repressor (CI) is in fact a repressor and activator of transcription, depending on where it is bound and to what promoter you are referring to. I know your question isn't directly about lambda phage, but I think this mechanism may be best explained in the context of where it was first invented: nature. So, I will try to briefly explain how the lambda repressor's dual role allows regulation of its own expression and controls lysogenic induction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cI gene is under the control of the PRM promoter. The PRM promoter is weak because the sigma factor of RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme has low affinity for it. Binding of RNAP to PRM, and thus transcription from there, at a reasonable level requires an activator. There is another protein involved in this process as well, called Cro, that can also bind the OR operators. The cro gene is under the control of the PR promoter. PRM is not a constitutive promoter because it requires an activator. I have heard PR called constitutive because it is a strong promoter and can bind RNAP without an activator. But, at the same time, it is under the control of the lambda repressor. I suppose it depends on which definition of 'constitutive promoter' you use.<\/p>\n\n<p>The OR operators are not identical and thus CI and Cro bind them with different affinities: CI has the highest affinity for OR1, followed distantly by OR2 and OR3, while Cro binds OR3 with highest affinity. Binding (of any two molecules) is dependent on both their affinity to each other as well as their effective concentration. At lower concentrations, CI can only bind OR1 and OR2 cooperatively. That is, each lambda repressor dimer binds to another, forming a tetramer, with one half binding OR1 and the other binding OR2. Binding both operators as tetramer allows for a stronger interaction. At higher concentrations, CI can bind OR3. Furthermore, OR1 and OR2 are located in the PR promoter, while OR3 is located in the PRM promoter.*<\/p>\n\n<p>Most lambda genes are under the control, directly or indirectly, of the PR and PL promoters (PL is similar to PR, but the promoter itself is not directly involved in cI regulation). When lambda exists as a prophage, its DNA is integrated into the host genome and most of its gene expression is repressed. This requires CI repression of PL and PR. When the viral DNA is first integrated, there is no CI in the cell (because it is a phage gene). Expression of cI is initially dependent on a different promoter (PRE), but I won't get into this here. Once CI concentration is high enough, it can bind to OR1 and OR2 as a tetramer. Binding here physically blocks the PR promoter and prevents expression of cro (CI acts as a repressor of PR here). It also interacts with RNAP (actually the sigma factor) and facilitates is binding to the PRM promoter, which leads to further cI expression. This process is commonly called recruitment: since CI is bound tightly to the DNA and has some affinity for RNAP, it can create a stronger interaction between the DNA and the RNAP-CI complex. Simply put, it induces the PRM promoter and is thus functioning as an activator of cI transcription. As CI concentration increases, it will bind OR3 more (which is located in the PRM promoter) and repress the PRM promoter by physically blocking RNAP from binding. In these ways, cI can autoregulate its expression level, both positively and negatively.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the lysogen is in some kind of stressful condition, normal host processes will result in proteolysis of CI and its DNA/sigma binding domain is cleaved from the dimer- and tetramerization domains. This means that CI can no longer oligomerize and is no longer able to bind cooperatively to OR1 and OR2. The result is loss of PRM activation (leading to vastly reduced cI expression) and also a loss of PR repression (leading to cro expression). Cro can then bind OR3 and represses PRM. Lack of PR repression also allows expression of early phage genes (which are under the control of PR).<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that a similar situation occurs at the PL promoter region, and binding of CI to both OR and OL as well as CI octomerization is important in prophage regulation, but that seems even further out of the scope of your question. Hopefully you can see how he lambda \"repressor\" actually functions as both a repressor and activator of transcription. If this kind of stuff interests you, I highly recommend a textbook called Molecular Biology of the Gene by Watson et al.<\/p>\n\n<p>*See comments. Upon further research, the PRM and PR promoters both overlap OR2 (Autoregulation and Function of a Repressor in Bacteriophage Lambda, Ptashne et al.), as the diagram in the OP shows. It appears that the -35 region of both PRM and PR overlap OR2 by 2 and 3 base pairs, respectively. That led me to wonder that if CI binds to OR2, which is in PRM, wouldn't it physically inhibit RNAP binding and thus repress transcription? Well it appears that CI interacts with the same region of sigma that is responsible for binding the -35 region of PRM (Amino acid substitutions in the -35 recognition motif of sigma 70 that result in defects in phage lambda repressor-stimulated transcription, Kuldell and Hochschild). So instead of blocking sigma binding here, it enhances it.<\/p>\n","answer_id":16616,"question_id":16611,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1397787453}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16611/how-can-ci-repressor-both-activate-and-repress-p-rm-promoter-found-in-lamb","last_activity_date":1427458418,"creation_date":1397688439,"answer_count":2,"title":"How can CI repressor both activate and repress $P_{RM}$ promoter found in $\\lambda$ phage?","body":"<p>I'm reading <a href=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/6/1/9\" rel=\"nofollow\">a paper<\/a> where the authors constructed a toggle switch that uses bidirectional $P_R/P_{RM}$ promoter found in the $\\lambda$ phage.

So why does CI binding to $O_{R2}$ (and $O_{R1}$ as well?) activate $P_{RM}$, while binding to $O_{R3}$ represses it - why the inconsistency?

Most of the dreams present situations where the individual is confronted with challenges or risks he/she might face during the life. Evolutionary concept of dream suggests that its a way by which brain try to notify some risks and train us to invade through it. The evolutionary acceptance of dreams is due to the \"threat simulation\" feature it possess. By which an individual can gain advantage of several situations he/she confronts in life.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finnish psychologist Antti Revonsuo posits that dreams have evolved\n  for \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream#Evolutionary_psychology_theories_of_dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\">threat simulation<\/a>\" exclusively. According to the Threat\n  Simulation Theory he proposes, during much of human evolution physical\n  and interpersonal threats were serious, giving reproductive advantage\n  to those who survived them. Therefore dreaming evolved to replicate\n  these threats and continually practice dealing with them. In support\n  of this theory, Revonsuo shows that contemporary dreams comprise much\n  more threatening events than people meet in daily non-dream life, and\n  the dreamer usually engages appropriately with them. It is suggested\n  by this theory that dreams serve the purpose of allowing for the\n  rehearsal of threatening scenarios in order to better prepare an\n  individual for real-life threats.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Question 1\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Yes they do. Studies suggests that animals can dream while sleeping, entire  human dreams occur during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">REM<\/a> sleep period. Most of the mammals do have the REM sleep period and it suggests that they do dream in this time of sleep.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dreams occur during REM sleep. We typically have 3 to 5 periods of REM\n  sleep per night. They occur at intervals of 1-2 hours and are quite\n  variable in length. An episode of REM sleep may last 5 minutes or over\n  an hour. About 20% of sleep is REM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a\n  night, perhaps an hour and half of that time, 90 minutes, is REM\n  sleep.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>REM sleep is characterized by a number of other features including\n  rapid, low-voltage brain waves detectable on the\n  electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, irregular breathing and heart\n  rate and involuntary muscle jerks.\n  <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp%3Farticlekey%3D8677+&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://animals.io9.com/what-do-animals-dream-about-1625103575\" rel=\"nofollow\">link<\/a> provides much more examples.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the studies of MIT,<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wilson, associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT,\n  and biology graduate student Kenway Louie trained rats to run along a\n  circular track for a food reward.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>They monitored the animals' brain activity during the task and while\n  they were asleep. While the animal ran, its brain created a\n  distinctive pattern of neurons firing in the hippocampus, a brain area\n  known to be involved in memory.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Like us, rats go through multiple stages of sleep, from slow-wave\n  sleep to REM sleep. In humans, it is during REM sleep that most\n  dreaming occurs.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The researchers then examined more than 40 REM episodes recorded while\n  the rats slept. About half repeated the unique signature of brain\n  activity that was created as the animal ran. The correlation was so\n  close that the researchers found that as the animal dreamed, they\n  could reconstruct where it would be in the maze if it were awake and\n  whether the animal was dreaming of running or standing still.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>These memories were replayed at about the same speed that the animal\n  had experienced them while awake.\n  <a href=\"http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/dreaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Question 2\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Dreaming about their future life while being awake, good question. If they do so then it will be a contradiction to our long held view of animal thought process. Most of the animal thought process that we try to reveal is through the firing of particular areas in their brain with the association of certain hormones. By this process we can find that which all neural pathways are used while dreaming and which are not.<\/p>\n\n<p>As we can find that animals also have dreams, then it is obvious that they could recollect it (some what vague) and can prepare mentally to face those particular situations. This doesn't mean that they do have plans about events coming for them in future, but researchers states that dreams are their only offline experience with those events. The memory of those dreams help them to ensure little advantage over those future events. While in the case of humans, we have a highly complex brain which is so good at simulating events by which we can plan our future, but other animals lack this complex structure(complex but not as much as ours), so they entirely rely on dreams for that purpose.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why do animals dream about one experience and not another? \"This work\n  allows us to evaluate the content of dreams and create tests to see\n  which awake patterns create patterns when the animal is asleep,\"\n  Wilson said. \"If we are able to evaluate the content of the dreaming\n  state, we may be able to find out why certain events get replayed and\n  others don't.\"<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This work also raises questions about long-held assumptions about\n  animals' thought processes. Only a handful of species \u2014 among them\n  chimps and dolphins \u2014 were thought to have any ability at all to\n  recall and evaluate detailed sequences of events after they occurred.\n  Wilson points out that \"dreams are the ultimate off-line experience.\n  This work demonstrates that animals are capable of re-evaluating their\n  experiences when they are not in the midst of them.\"\n  <a href=\"http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/dreaming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":30788,"question_id":8897,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8897/do-animals-also-dream","last_activity_date":1427452642,"creation_date":1371972230,"answer_count":3,"title":"Do animals also dream?","body":"<p>By \"dream\", I mean:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dreaming while sleeping.<\/li>\n<li>Dreaming about their future life while being awake.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.<\/p>\n","question_id":8897,"tags":["ethology","dreaming"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":3,"protected_date":1427447955,"is_answered":true,"view_count":174,"up_vote_count":6},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a8bd60d95876983dcf983188c5fa682?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":636,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/636/pete","reputation":21,"display_name":"Pete"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/222b478bab6d59dc5de514a87dba88cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":389,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/389/bobthejoe","reputation":4911,"display_name":"bobthejoe","accept_rate":53},"score":0,"post_id":1469,"edited":false,"creation_date":1332121384,"comment_id":1833,"body":"I&#39;m not sure is RAP5 is an antibody.

However they concern RAP-1A, so I guess my question is now what is the difference in  structure and function of RAP-1A and RAP-5? Does anyone know of X-ray structure analysis being used to examine RAP-5? <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>original question<\/h2>\n\n<p>I'm a University Physics student writing a mock review article on what to me feels like a very 'un-physicsy' antibody - RAP-5. <\/p>\n\n<p>Although my knowledge of Biology is pretty poor, research is going quite well. I've found a lot of papers from the 80s talking about conducting immunohisto(/cyto)chemistry experiments, most of them finding that RAP-5 can be used to determine whether a cell has the ras in it, so they are able to measure the percentage of cells that are neoplastic (I believe this means cancerous) and contain ras and the percentage of cells which are normal and contain ras. (the ras-gene being a proto-oncogene which on mutation can result in permanently switched on ras proteins (p21?), which results in proliferation of cells and therefore can cause tumors). This is all very nice but on first glance immunohistochemistry doesn't seem to involve a huge amount of physics (for my bio-physics assignment), apart from using an optical microscope. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was hoping to be able focus a section of my article on the physical techniques involved in determining the structure of RAP-5. Although there seems to be plenty of literature on uses of RAP-5, I am struggling to find anything on the details on why it is able to be used in such experiments. In other words, I presume that its function is to bind on to an epitode specific to the ras protein (amino acids 10 -17 have popped up a few times) but I don't know if there is any imaging one can do to have a look at the structure and conclude 'yes this is why it binds to ras proteins and not to others'. Is there a technique that is likely to have been used to examine the structure of RAP-5? Is it's tertiary structure likely to be 'Y' shaped like other antibodies? Does it differ in structure from RAP1-4? (<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ht1bypUY7c8C&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=ras%20Adenylate%20cyclase%20rap&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WXvSq69THL&amp;sig=ijXnD_UdHlkBumk2DmSOQUy3fu8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LABlT_eeGeOy0QWLg8iWCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ras%20Adenylate%20cyclase%20rap&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book<\/a> informs me that RAP1 and RAP2 have 60% sequence identity, but most sources seem to leave out RAP3-to-5, some evening telling me that the RAP family consists of RAP1A/B, RAP2A/B/C and no others!).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, if RAP-5 is an antibody, does this mean that it is produced in the body and gets involved in the ras protein signal pathway in order to reduce too much ras expression?

Simply speaking, an adaptation might be defined as a trait that is now fixed in the population (meaning that all individuals in the population carry this trait) but when it was not fixed yet it was beneficial. Such definitions would not fit the concept of greediness if we assume there is some genetic variance for greediness. But while I am not aware of any study on the subject, a level of greediness very probably influence the fitness  (=~ reproductive success) of its carrier. If someone is extremely greedy, he might not find a mate and may fail to reproduce. On the other side, someone that is extremely generous may give everything it has up to its life and would definitely fail to reproduce. Therefore, it seems at first though that there is what we call stabilizing selection on the level of greediness.<\/p>\n\n<p>--> It depends on the meaning of adaptation.

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex\" rel=\"nofollow\">neocortex<\/a>, the outer most layer of brain which is considered as the recent evolved part of brain. The neocortex is actively developing in both humans and dolphins, one of the most striking features among them is that human neocortex is having large thickness and dolphins are having thin one with more folds than ours. The folding in neocortex is a technique to increase its surface area. This substantial difference is due to the evolutionary divergent way both the species took. <\/p>\n\n<p>Dolphins have a complex echolocation system and binocular eyes, they need to create the visual and sonar image of their surroundings and studies shown that their increased brain size is due to the tremendous volume of data they need to process for these purposes. Also being a social animal their neocortex consists of connections like us but as we both are evolutionary separated for about 95 million years ago most of the brain areas are diversified and evolved. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dolphins showed that they can understand a symbolic, human-based\n  language, where the words are either whistles or hand gestures. And\n  the dolphins could easily understand that we use different word orders\n  to mean different things. So they understand syntax. The dolphin brain\n  is arranged in a completely different way from ours, and yet they can\n  still understand what we are trying to teach them. Lou Herman also\n  showed that dolphins are right up there with humans and chimpanzees in\n  being able to understand that when we point at something or look at\n  something, we\u2019re meaning \u201cDon\u2019t look at me; look at what I\u2019m looking\n  at.\u201d He\u2019s done all kinds of really fascinating things, and his work\n  has contributed the most to our understanding of what these animals\n  can do.<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aLwZGGfACqsJ:www.earthintransition.org/2010/05/dolphins-how-smart/%20&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":30821,"question_id":30805,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30805/behavioral-change-in-dolphins-during-different-hemispheres-activity-periods","last_activity_date":1427432548,"creation_date":1427388474,"answer_count":1,"title":"Behavioral change in dolphins during different hemispheres activity periods?","body":"<p>It is known that dolphins never sleep in the sense that we do, instead they have one hemisphere of the brain sleeping while the other one is awake.
