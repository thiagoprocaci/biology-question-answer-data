Broadly speaking these can be classed as pro- or anti-inflammatory. Pro-inflammatory cytokines promote inflammation, and anti-inflammatory cytokines inhibit inflammation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Inflammation (again, broadly speaking) is associated with the 'innate' immune response - this is the immediate response by neutrophils and macrophages (among others), and these cells release a variety of molecules designed to damage cells around them.

The causes of this aren't entirely certain, but it could be that the adaptive immune response (i.e. the memory T-/B- cells) is not as effective in older ages so the innate response is more important, or that it is just simply left 'unchecked'. Either way, the result this that the pro-inflammatory response can end up damaging host tissues, including the brain, without the corresponding repair instigated by anti-inflammatory cells/cytokines.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, or glucocorticoids) will, in theory, reduce inflammation, but by suppressing the immune system the risk of infection naturally rises, and there may be unforeseen consequences to prolonged use (the immune system does a lot more than just fend of bacteria - e.g. it is essential for tissue maintenance and regeneration), so I am by no means suggesting the use of anti-inflammatories to protect brain function!<\/p>\n","answer_id":1986,"question_id":1980,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1980/from-inflammation-to-sickness-and-depression-when-the-immune-system-subjugates","last_activity_date":1335467475,"creation_date":1335437273,"answer_count":1,"title":"From inflammation to sickness and depression: when the immune system subjugates the brain","body":"<p>Recently, some research, for example <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2919277/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a> has proposed that inflammation can cause innate immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on the brain to cause sickness behaviour.<\/p>\n\n<p>My questions are:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) What medication would potentially help to reduce the inflammation?

These can be made in the lab manually, or purchased commercially from reputable vendors (I recommend Invitrogen/Life Tech, NEB, Promega).<\/p>\n\n<p>Chemically competency is achieved using <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=6345791\">Hanahan<\/a>'s method or some a variation thereof. The method involves washing the bacteria in a series of buffers containing various di-valent cation chloride salts (CaCl<sub>2<\/sub>, RbCl<sub>2<\/sub>, etc). <strong>Commercially available <em>E. coli<\/em> are sold as \"regular\" and \"ultra\" competent, ranging from 10<sup>6<\/sup> to 10<sup>6<\/sup> for regular, and the highest I've seen is 10<sup>10<\/sup> cfu/&micro;g DNA.<\/strong> For maximum efficiency, especially since a small plasmid such as yours will be easy to transform, <strong>electroporation is a more efficient technique, but requires specialized equpment<\/strong>. <strong>Electroporation can yield >10<sup>10<\/sup> cfu/&micro;g<\/strong>.

Transformation efficiency is very sensitive to many factors, including heat shock time, cooling times, thawing time, amount and size of plasmid DNA. All things being equal, the size and quantity of DNA are important for your purposes. Transformation efficiency generally increases with quantity of DNA, but there is a saturation point, and evenetually having too much DNA decreases the yield. Also, efficiency decreases linearly with plasmid size. For example, pUC19, the control vector, is ~2.7 kbp, and your library plasmid is ~6.6 kbp, so you should expect for the same mass of DNA you will have lost 60% transformation due to plasmid size. This loss is due to the physically larger size of DNA being more difficult to move into the bacteria.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1893,"question_id":1892,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1334886247},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2550aa98332616362fa07d023da45d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":28,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/28/gergana-vandova","reputation":5081,"display_name":"Gergana Vandova","accept_rate":35},"score":6,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user560"},"score":0,"post_id":1904,"edited":false,"creation_date":1334958715,"comment_id":2459,"body":"That&#39;s quite the downside to electrocompetent cells.

Simple Mendelian traits, where smooth or wrinkly peas will have wrinkly offspring, allow us to segregate individuals with pure dominant / heterologous and pure recessive traits.  When we have done so the chance of inheriting the trait can be predicted precisely (i.e. 25/50/25%).<\/p>\n\n<p>The number of simple mendelian traits which are observed in an individual are pretty doggone rare. Even things that are dominant like dark hair are usually more complex.

There are single mutations that cause diabetes like systems (called MODY diabetes) for instance, but more than 99% of diabetes are not caused by these mutations.

One example that comes to mind is Joe Thornton's research where he reconstructed a gene for an ancient protein and compared it to the more modern versions. They found out that the key mutations that modified the protein sequence could not be simply changed back to obtain the more ancient form, because in the meantime many neutral mutations had accumulated in that protein and while they did not change the protein sequence, they interacted with the protein-changing mutations and prevented the de-evolution of the protein.<\/p>\n\n<p>The paper I have in mind (there are many more on this) is: Bridgham, Jamie T, Eric A Ortlund, and Joseph W Thornton. 2009. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08249.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">An Epistatic Ratchet Constrains the Direction of Glucocorticoid Receptor Evolution.<\/a>\u201d Nature 461 (7263) (September 24): 515\u2013519. doi:10.1038/nature08249.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in a sort of more esoteric example (as it is not directly de-evolution), blind cavefish have multiple mutations (and sometimes in multiple genes) that cumulatively result in loss of vision. Let's then say you have population of the fish that have sight-losing mutations in gene A and another population with mutations in gene B. Both populations are blind, but if you could cross the fish from the two populations, the eye-loss mutations in genes A and B would be substituted by 'correct' versions from the other population and thus both fish would be able to see again. While not de-evolution in itself, it shows that for relatively simple changes that were not influenced by other changes in the genome, you can rewind the clock and get the long-lost phenotypes, even like the sight.<\/p>\n\n<p>See here: Borowsky, Richard. 2008. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207022622\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restoring Sight in Blind Cavefish.<\/a>\u201d Current Biology : CB 18 (1) (January 8): R23\u20134. doi:10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.023.

Furthermore, all promoters share highly similar elements, for instance the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TATA_box\">TATA box<\/a> \u2013 literally the occurrence of \u201cTATA\u201d in the genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, just looking for occurrences of \u201cTATA\u201d would yield vastly more spurious hits than actual promoters but combined with other information you get a <em>gene model<\/em> \u2013 a statistical machine which can tell you with high confidence where on a genome the genes are located.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Once you have found the genes in a sequence which you can trivially translate to amino acid sequences, you can try to form inferences about the function of the proteins (a protein\u2019s function is an almost-direct consequence of its sequence). Unfortunately, discovering the function of a protein from its sequence alone isn\u2019t possible but we <em>do<\/em> know the functions of many proteins.<\/p>\n\n<p>When we now look at a genome and find a mutation in a protein-coding gene we can infer that the function of this protein is probably modified. Most mutations are so-called deleterious mutations (e.g. by deleting a single nucleotide you get a <em>frame shift<\/em> in the codons, and all the subsequent codons no longer make sense), meaning that they <em>destroy<\/em> the protein\u2019s function.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other, much rarer, mutations modify the protein\u2019s function, making it more or less efficient, or giving it another function altogether.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the simplest case (but these are rare), a single such mutation can explain a complex phenotype. This is known as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mendelian_traits_in_humans\">Mendelian trait<\/a> and can be used to explain a phenotypes such as eye colour, but also hereditary diseases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually, though, it is merely one of many adjusting screws which skew your susceptibility to a certain phenotype in one direction. For instance, you might be slightly more susceptible to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation\">breast cancer<\/a> or diabetes.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is <em>one<\/em> use of the DNA sequence, there are many more; in the last decade, we have realised that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulation\"><em>regulation<\/em><\/a> of gene activity plays a much larger role than anticipated, and most research today looks at regulatory patterns on the DNA level. This is also done with sequence data, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be a simple schema analogous to the genetic code to understand regulation. Instead, it\u2019s a complex interplay of many completely unrelated mechanisms.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1885,"question_id":1884,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1334825943},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c66c4d97a7bc3859a85253f003e1fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"moderator","user_id":6,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6/mad-scientist","reputation":6781,"display_name":"Mad Scientist","accept_rate":55},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1334826680,"creation_date":1334826680,"body":"<p>There is a whole lot you can do with genome sequences, I'll focus on a specific example here. <\/p>\n\n<p>A gene encodes for a protein, but as long as you have only the DNA sequence of that gene you can't easily find out what exactly the protein that is encoded by the gene does.

I'll do the latter, but in brief.<\/p>\n\n<p>The strings of the four nucleotides encode genes. Sometimes these genes are broken into protein-coding portions (exons) and sometimes intervening, non-coding regions (introns). Bacteria, for example do not have introns within genes while most human genes do. The nucleotides in the protein-coding portion of the gene do just that - give instructions on how to synthesize the protein by directing which tRNAs the ribosome uses to translate the genetic code into a protein chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>A useful phrase is <strong>protein sequence dictates protein structure and that structure dictates function<\/strong>. So, the proteins do things and many act as enzymes or modulators of enzyme activity. An enzyme catalyzes a biochemical reaction, lowering the activation energy to go from reactant(s) to product(s). One enzyme can be thought of as one unit within a metabolic network. A modulator might activate or deactivate an existing enzyme. A protein kinase is a good example of a modulator.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, string some of those enzymes together to build a pathway. A common example is glycolysis. Think of this as a chain where the output or product of enzyme A serves as input to enzyme B, whose product is the input to enzyme C, and so on. These pathways are two-way, but it is exceedingly difficult to travel from the final product all the way up such a pathway to the initial input within the confines of a biological system. Thus, the pathways in practical terms are thought of as one-way.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the pathways do not function in isolation. The final product may serve as input to one, two or more other pathways. Your pathway of choice may begin with the output of another process. Furthermore, pathways can branch: Glycolysis can proceed to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, or directly after glucose 6-phosphate formation can be shunted to the pentose phosphate pathway to yield reducing power and 5-carbon sugars (to be used in ATP, CoA, FAD, NAD+, DNA and RNA). Now, pathways leading to other pathways and branches and such make a network. <\/p>\n\n<p>You and your colleagues might want to know if genes within a metabolic network are over- or under-represented in a test compared to control. Or, genes for a given network are not present in one species compared to several others. Or, one could estimate the flux through such a network given a set of measures.<\/p>\n\n<p>Peruse examples at both KEGG and Reactome, expecially at KEGG where you can view pathways pertinent to your organism(s) of choice.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1798,"question_id":1794,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1794/mechanics-of-going-from-dna-sequence-to-metabolic-network","last_activity_date":1334319419,"creation_date":1334264829,"answer_count":1,"title":"Mechanics of going from DNA sequence to metabolic network","body":"<p>My apologies for possibly a naive question.

In biology the organisms are classified according to how constant their body temperature is:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>homeothermic<\/strong> (from greek \"hom(e)o\" = equal, same) -- organisms, who manage to maintain constant body temperature.<\/li>\n<li><strong>poikilothermic<\/strong> (from greek \"poikilos\" = changing, changeable) - ogranisms, whose body temperature fluctuates over time. It is implied here, that  the body temperature follows the fluctuation of the environment temperature, even though this is strictly not correct (see below)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There is another orthogonal classification, which takes into account the metabolic properties of the organisms:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>endothermic<\/strong> organisms actively produce heat in their bodies, whereas<\/li>\n<li><strong>exotermic<\/strong> organisms mostly rely upon external heat sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>What do we know about dinosaurs' methabolism?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there is no one living dinosaur, so we can only reason about their methabolism basing upon the fossils (and possible DNA from moskitos trapped into ambers).<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the most cited works here is the \"Dinosaur Fossils Predict Body Temperatures\" (<a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040248\">link<\/a> to the free full text), where the authors write:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps the greatest mystery surrounding dinosaurs concerns whether\n  they were endotherms, ectotherms, or some unique intermediate form.\n  Here we present a model that yields estimates of dinosaur body\n  temperature based on ontogenetic growth trajectories obtained from\n  fossil bones.

The common discussion revolves around viruses which do many of these things but not in a self-sustained way.<\/p>\n\n<p>The question at hand then asks if cells are the minimum unit of life? What makes a cell a cell is that there is <a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/research/the-emergence-of-competition-between-model-protocells/\" rel=\"nofollow\">compartmentalization<\/a>. The underlying reason behind this compartment is due to the necessity of tying the phenotype to the genotype. Paraphrasing using our definition of life, it links the information with the function that the information carries out. In the modern biological scheme, it keeps the proteins (phenotype) with the DNA (genotype).<\/p>\n\n<p>The necessity of compartmentalization is negated when the phenotype is already linked with the genotype. The most frequent example is RNA where the material that carries the information is also the material that carries out its function. It tend, is reasonable to hypothesize that life can be made entirely with RNA without the need for compartmentalization (although compartmentalization certainly helps see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20659684\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paegal and Joyce<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16173749\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chen and Szostak<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Recent <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131595\" rel=\"nofollow\">experiments<\/a> by Gerry Joyce and others have been able to satisfy several of the requirements of life. The have self-replicating RNAs, that store information, that reproduce their information, that introduce alterations to their information, and do it in a self-sustained manner. What Gerry and his colleagues agree on is that their current self-replication Ribozyme system doesn't do anything particularly novel. However, by introducing a larger variety of functional elements to their ribozymes perhaps they will.<\/p>\n","answer_id":1666,"question_id":1663,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1333685413},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TMSvO.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":542,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/542/hermann-ingjaldsson","reputation":586,"display_name":"Hermann Ingjaldsson"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13f5a730dead005d0a3a947d3c09ab81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":691,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/691/chm","reputation":553,"display_name":"CHM"},"score":1,"post_id":1670,"edited":false,"creation_date":1333642750,"comment_id":2154,"body":"Molecules aren&#39;t &quot;alive&quot;.

This is pretty good as it discusses all the different stages including breakup.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, there seems to be a <em>lot<\/em> factors at play which elicits various responses through different stages of love.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of anxiety and stress, initially, there's a large increase in levels of cortisol[2] and a marked drop in serotonin. Depletion of serotonin is found in many psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety and panic disorder. There's even been evidence that these levels at early stages of love are similar to those suffering with OCD. Obviously, the 'symptoms' of early love are quite similar to these conditions so it's hypothesised that this, at least in part contributes to those feelings.[1]. It was found that these levels are back to normal in 12-24 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>The elevated levels of cortisol contribute to the feelings of stress but this hormone has also been shown to promote attachment.[2].<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also changes in activity of the amygdala. Responsible for regulating a lot of emotions such as fear and sexual drive, the amygdala can activate autonomic nervous system responses through the mechanisms which Kevin described. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are a bunch of other things at play here including dopamine, oxytocin, vasopressin, nerve growth factor (NGF), testosterone, increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA) and variations in activity in other areas of the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, that first reference gives a pretty comprehensive overview of the mechanisms involved.<\/p>\n\n<p>To answer the actual question about the fluttering feeling, as Kevin mentioned, it's hypothesised that this is caused by reduced peristalsis in the intestines as a result of sympathetic stimulation. I don't have an academic reference for this but there are plenty of non-academic sources that talk about it (a quick Google of <em>butterflies in stomach and physiology<\/em> will probably show them).<\/p>\n\n<p>A lot of the mechanisms noted above can contribute to, sensitise for or cause sympathetic activation.

Zoidberg has posted an answer describing the mechanism as I was writing mine, so I'll move directly onto effectiveness. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason that, as you say, the mechanism is not particularly effective in humans is our relatively small amount of body hair.  As mentioned the purpose of the erector muscles causing the hairs to stand up is to allow for air to be trapped at the surface of the skin rather than absorbing heat from the body then taking it quickly away.  Mammals with denser fur/hair are likely to have a much better insulating effect from goosebumps.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Some animals have adapted to use the mechanism for another purpose, however; the porcupine being a prime example.  When threatened, the porcupine uses its <em>arrectores pilorum<\/em> muscles to elevate all its quills, making it appear larger and more threatening or to actively repel an attacker.  The extra rigidity that they gain from doing this<sup>1<\/sup> also helps to contribute towards making their spines a very effective defence:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1xxM4.jpg\" alt=\"Dog after porcupine attack\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Goosebumps have also been reported in humans during periods of stress, anxiety and even sexual arousal.

It's also said that a large variation in fiber composition of skeletal muscle within subgroups of athletic ability. This suggests that factors other than fiber-type composition contribute to performance.[3].<\/p>\n\n<p>A small study carried out in the Croatian Navy found that ectomorphs had a better ability to sprint than endomorphs.[5]. They also found a positive correlation between calf girth and sprinting ability.<\/p>\n\n<p>The information is a bit disjointed and sparse. However, to finally come around to the question at hand, it seems that although there may be differences according to body type initially (which obviously also has a genetic basis), training and physical activity contributes significantly to what number and types of fibres individuals possess. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are lots of sport-specific research papers examining individuals' performance and suitability on body types.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>A note on somatotyping:<\/em> I guess it might also be handy note that somatotyping (endomorph, ectomorph and mesomorph) is just one theory on measuring an individual and it does have critics. The theory was initially developed in an attempt to link body type to behaviour. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's been suggested that measurements like BMI are much more objective and useful.[6]. Another point made was that bodies change according to a number of environmental variables, nutrition etc.[7]. For example, one study suggested that intense labour during adolescence may affect somatotype (there are a few similar studies).[8]. So perhaps while using somatotypes to identify a person at one point in time is useful, it has limits in use as a long term classification. <\/p>\n\n<p>This point probably has more relevance to the question at hand since with training and physical activity, a person can potentially change their somatotype at least to some extent; and also the number and types of muscle fibers (which evidence supports).<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Puthucheary Z, et al. <em>Genetic influences in sport and physical performance.<\/em> Sports Med. 2011. 41:845-59.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Nielsen J. <em>Glucose intolerance in the West African Diaspora: a skeletal muscle fibre type distribution hypothesis.<\/em> Acta Physiol. 2011. 202(4):605-16.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>DeLee: DeLee and Drez's Orthopaedic Sports Medicine. 3rd ed.

I don't know how this works for chronic use, as most literature refers to acute scenarios. Either way, orally ingested, 30-50g is said to be toxic to humans while 350g can be fatal.[3].<\/p>\n\n<p>So...<\/p>\n\n<h2>Gasoline's Constituents<\/h2>\n\n<p>A lot of components that make up gasoline are toxic to humans. This includes for example, benzene, toluene, xylene and butadiene. It's a mixture of more than 500 hydrocarbons and additives made up of:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>60\u201370% alkanes (paraffins)<\/li>\n<li>25\u201330% aromatics<\/li>\n<li>6\u20139% alkenes (olefins).[2].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you really want to know specifics about metabolism of gasoline, you can probably check out how some of the constituents are metabolised (processed) and their effects. This is because different components have varying metabolic pathways. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to check this out, see Reese, et al at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1520023/pdf/envhper00383-0118.pdf.[3]. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Ingestion and Toxicity<\/h2>\n\n<p>Apparently, most <em>reported<\/em> cases of toxicity from gasoline occur from inhalation or absorption through the skin (intravenous use has also been reported). Even though ingestion is a frequent occurrence, there's not much data on outcomes after oral ingestion.[1],[2]. Gasoline can however be well absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract[2]. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main target organ of gasoline toxicity is the nervous system and at high doses, this effect can cause death within minutes.[3]. However, generally, the primary cause of mortality seems to be related to gasoline's toxicity to the lungs. There are severe effects on the pulmonary system. Other effects of ingestion hasn't been as well documented.[1],[2]. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's suggested that these compounds have a direct effect on lung tissue and  disrupts gas exchange and causes fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This in turn causes the oxygen levels in the body to drop (hypoxemia).[2]. There are many other toxic effects on the lungs as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, liver damage, kidney damage, damage to blood cells, gastric ulcers and toxicity in the heart can occur.[2],[3].

Oxygen in the gel interferes with polymerisation, slowing it down and making it less consistent, so degassing makes it faster and more uniform.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/SDS-PAGE.htm\">EncorBio SDS-PAGE protocol<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Polymerization is quicker and more uniform if you degas the first three solutions for a few minutes in an Ehrlenmeyer flask on a house vacuum prior to addition of the last three reagents. Molecular oxygen inhibits polymerisation by reacting with the free radical SO<sub>4<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup> ions, which is actually the reason why PAGE gels are poured in tubes or between plates and not in open top horizontal apparatuses, as can be done with agarose. Also it's a good idea to layer some isopropanol on top of the gel as this prevents oxygen getting in and inhibiting polymerisation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Oxygen can also lead to oxidation of protein products, which might be crucial if you then want to extract the products and use them for something else (e.g. <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.200305800/abstract\">Sun &amp; Anderson, 2004<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, having bubbles in your gel can distort the results and make them less reproducible, as the bubbles will not form consistently with each repetition and they disrupt the physical medium of the polyacrylamide. So another purpose of degassing is to ensure repeatability.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_1156.pdf\">Bio-Rad acrylamide polymerisation info sheet<\/a> has the best info I could find:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The formation of polyacrylamide gels proceeds via free radical\n  polymerization. The reaction is therefore inhibited by any \n  element or compound that serves as a free radical trap\n  (Chrambach 1985). Oxygen is such an inhibitor. Oxygen,\n  present in the air, dissolved in gel solutions, or adsorbed to\n  the surfaces of plastic, rubber, etc., will inhibit, and in extreme\n  cases prevent, acrylamide polymerization. Proper degassing\n  is critical for reproducibility. Therefore, one of the most \n  important steps in the preparation of polyacrylamide gels is\n  the evacuation, or \u201cdegassing\u201d of gel solutions immediately\n  prior to pouring the gel. This is done by placing the flask of\n  gel solution in a vacuum chamber or under a strong aspirator.\n  In some cases, a vacuum pump may be required.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Buffer stock solutions and monomer stock solutions are usually\n  stored at 4°C. Cold solutions have a greater capacity for \n  dissolved oxygen. The process of degassing is faster and\n  more complete if the gel solution is brought to room \n  temperature (23\u201325°C)\u201a before degassing begins.\n  Furthermore, if a cold gel solution is placed under vacuum,\n  the process of evacuation tends to keep the solution cold.\n  Pouring a gel with a cold solution will have a substantial \n  negative effect on the rate of polymerization and on the \n  quality of the resulting gel.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Polymerization in which riboflavin is used as one of the \n  initiators calls for degassing. The conversion of riboflavin from\n  the flavo to the leuco form (the species active in initiation)\n  actually requires a small amount of oxygen (Gordon 1973).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This explains why polymerization initiated primarily by riboflavin\n  can be completely blocked by exhaustive degassing. However,\n  oxygen in excess of that needed to convert riboflavin to the\n  active form will inhibit polymer chain elongation, as it does in\n  reactions initiated only by ammonium persulfate and TEMED.\n  Thus, while degassing is still important for limiting inhibition, \n  it must not be so extensive that it prevents conversion of\n  riboflavin to the active form. For polymerization initiated by\n  riboflavin/TEMED, or riboflavin/TEMED/ammonium persulfate\n  systems, degassing should not exceed 5 min.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>A consequence of the interaction of riboflavin with oxygen is\n  that riboflavin seems to act as an oxygen scavenger. This is\n  supported by the observation that the addition of riboflavin \n  (5 µg/ml) to stacking gel solutions containing ammonium \n  persulfate/TEMED initiators results in cleaner, more uniform\n  polymerization at gel surfaces exposed to oxygen (such as\n  combs). The same effect could likely be achieved by more\n  thorough degassing of solutions without riboflavin.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Whether using chemical polymerization (ammonium \n  persulfate/TEMED) or photochemical polymerization\n  (riboflavin/TEMED or riboflavin/TEMED/ammonium persulfate\n  initiators), reproducible gel quality and separation \n  characteristics require careful attention to gel solution \n  temperature before degassing, and to degassing time, \n  temperature, and vacuum. These parameters should be \n  kept constant every time gels are prepared.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long quotes, but they are pasted here in case the original sources disappear.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.200305800\">Sun, G. &amp; Anderson, V.E.

But that does not necessarily matter. <\/p>\n\n<p>Relatedness, in modern taxonomy, depends purely on common ancestry, not necessarily on similarity of specific traits. As others have explained, we make theories about ancestry relationships based on many criteria and logic, not just variation in one gene. In this tree, you should think of A, B, and C as theoretical, extinct common ancestors of the species below them in the tree. The list of apes at the bottom represent the relevant extant species species only. Bonobos and Common Chimps have a more recent common ancestor (C) than either Bonobos and Humans (B) or Common Chimps and Humans (B). This is why @mgkrebs said that both qualify equally as most closely related, because the common ancestor of each pair is the same. <\/p>\n\n<p>Few would disagree that Bonobos do seem to be more similar to humans than Chimps are to humans, but that actually does not mean they are more closely related evolutionarily! Theoretically there are two ways this could happen even if Bonobos and Chimps are equally related to humans, either our common ancestor with Chimps and Bonobos also shared the traits we have in common with Bonobos and Chimps changed, or Bonobos and Humans happened to develop these similarities independently. The former is a simpler explanation, but either are possible for each similarity. Again, the key in understanding this is in thinking about the theoretical ancestor species, B and C. The only way Humans could be more closely related to Bonobos than chimps is if the common ancestor, B, was a descendant of C, which seems extremely unlikely and as far as I know is not supported by the genetic research in this area.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our common ancestor with Gorillas (A) on the other hand is much \"earlier\" than our common ancestor with Chimps and Bonobos, so Gorillas are less closely related to use than the group containing Bonobos and Chimps. <\/p>\n","answer_id":1476,"question_id":1216,"up_vote_count":12}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1216/what-is-the-closest-species-to-humans-in-animal-kingdom","last_activity_date":1332056606,"creation_date":1330351754,"answer_count":4,"title":"What is the closest species to humans in animal kingdom?","body":"<p>I presumed chimpanzees were the closest relatives of us.

That explains why chimpanzees\n  are very like us, while mice are less so. Chimpanzees are our close\n  cousins, mice are our more distant cousins.

Baboons and rhesus macaques are both monkeys, close\n  cousins of each other, and with almost identical FoxP2 genes.

These nodal cells are found throughout the heart and they make up what's called the conducting system. These nodal cells don't need neural or hormonal input for them to spread action potentials, they have this mechanism to spontaneously start action potentials on their own called a pacemaker potential, BUT they can be influenced by neural (think sympathetic and parasympathetic) or hormonal input. These external inputs change the frequency (the pace) of the heart beat by influencing the pacemaker potential of the nodal cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>The sympathetic nerve fibers send out epinephrine which cause the pacemaker potential to occur at a faster rate, that's why during exercise (when epinephrine is released... hopefully) the heart beats faster. Parasympathetic nerve fibers send out acetylcholine which causes the pacemaker potential to occur at a slower rate, thus slowing down the heart. What does this mean in regards to the cardiac cycle? It influences how much blood (the volume) is ejected during the cycle. The volume of blood that is ejected from the ventricles, called cardiac output (CO), which is also how many liters/min, is determined by 2 other factors: stroke volume (volume of blood ejected during each ventricle during systole) and heart rate (CO = HR x SV). And therein lies a part of the answer to your question: when heart rate decreases because of parasympathetic stimulation, cardiac output should also decrease, granted stroke volume stays constant. <\/p>\n\n<p>I unfortunately do not know how acetylcholine affects blood pressure.
