Amino acids 'snap' together in a very specific way. The amino group bonds to the carboxyl group of the previous amino acid, making a chain. The side groups of an amino acid aren't involved. Like Legos that snap together only one way and can be any color or have any designs on the side. The difference here is glutamate has a carboxyl group as part of its side chain. It's like a Lego with holes on two sides. The NRPS here connects the cysteine to the side chain of the glutamate instead of the 'bottom' where it would go if a ribosome-synthesized glutamate-cysteine bond. <\/p>\n\n<p>This gamma bond also explains the increased longevity of the product. Proteases aren't designed for things that look like this. The gamma bond doesn't 'fit right' in the protease active sites and therefore activity is slower.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40354,"question_id":40130,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40130/non-ribosomal-peptide-synthesis-why-glutathione-cannot-be-produced-by-the-ribos","last_activity_date":1446844461,"creation_date":1446299302,"answer_count":2,"title":"Non-ribosomal peptide synthesis: why Glutathione cannot be produced by the ribosome?","body":"<p><strong>Case<\/strong>: I am writing a summary for a class in protein structure and function, and was asked to describe some different ways that peptides are synthesized (that does not involve the ribosome).

There are many possible diseases that can cause amino acids to be detected in the urine, some as innocuous as overexertion or exposure to temperature extremes, and some as serious as Hodgkin's lymphoma, Amyloidosis, Malaria, Lupus, etc. For a more complete list see this <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/protein-in-urine/basics/causes/sym-20050656\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mayo Clinic page<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the blood, there are certain normal levels of amino acids found naturally in the blood. The reason for testing these levels is that certain imbalances can be indicative of different medical conditions. A doctor can use these levels to help to identify a problem that may not be noticed or may use it to diagnose a disease that you are seeking treatment for. This <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003361.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">MedlinePlus page,<\/a> has information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Testing of Blood and Urine amino acids can and will be done in conjunction with one another in order to help narrow down the possible diagnoses that are likely.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: Personal medical questions and health advice are off-topic on Biology SE. We cannot safely answer questions for your specific situation and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit to address comments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"Also, based on your answer and the Mayo Clinic link, what I understand is in a healthy individual - testing amino acids from urine might give false positives?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n\n<p>I think that your concept of false positive here is incorrect. A false positive for this test would be indicating higher levels of amino acid in a sample than the sensitivity and standard error for the test would allow for. <\/p>\n\n<p>That there is a laundry list of reasons why one might find abnormal levels of amino acids only goes to the fact that the kidneys \"see\" the results of several metabolic processes (normal or abnormal) and urinalysis is only a single datapoint from a spectrum of data for a clinician to begin to recognize a pattern and formulate a diagnosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for greater accuracy, when comparing \"Urine Random\" to \"Urine 24 hour\" I would say that the \"Urine 24 hour\" test is more accurate strictly from a perspective of statistics. The larger the sample size for any test, the greater the level of confidence that the results observed are not due to random chance, error, or outliers in the data. <\/p>\n\n<p>But this is the same concept for a political poll, marketing research analysis, or medicine; larger sample size gives you a clearer picture, but it does so at an increased cost. So the single screen is there just to look for issues, possibly based on a complaint that brought you into the doctor's office, or a way of monitoring a previously diagnosed condition and/or treatment, while the time courses are done to provide a clearer understanding of what is representative for the levels in that individual. <\/p>\n\n<p>The single test has a number of reasons why it might be anomalous. Maybe the elevator from the underground parking garage was out of order and you had to walk up several flights of stairs to the office where they were collecting the sample, so it would show an elevated result due to exertion. Or maybe your drank a liter of water before the exam and your urine is dilute, causing a false negative. So to mitigate those anomalies, you run the time course, but usually only if there is a problem suspected because of the fact that it is an increased and unnecessary cost if all other indications are that the person is healthy or the result is easily explainable due to other data collected.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>\"I also understand that at times they would be used in conjunction - which seems logical. What I am trying to understand is which would give more accurate 'picture'. If one is not more accurate than the other, then what would be the difference between the 'picture' acquired from a blood test and the urine test.\"<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Each test has its own parameters and give you an independent picture, that can be used to put together a more complete whole. Their accuracy will be based on their own sensitivities and built in standard errors and one will not be more accurate than the other because comparing free amino acids in the blood versus in the urine are two different pictures with different normal outcomes. <\/p>\n\n<p>More samples, i.e. \"Urine 24 Hours\" or multiple blood draws over a time course is really the only way that you will improve on the accuracy of the individual tests, for the reasons I gave above. <\/p>\n\n<p>They also have different baselines. Blood you expect to find free amino acids and there are ranges of normal results that you would expect to find in the blood. Here, too much or too little amino acid would be an indicator of a possible problem. For urine on the other hand, one would not expect to see elevated levels of amino acids, so here, a test that indicates elevated levels of amino acids indicates that more follow up is needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Think of it in terms of an analogy about astronomical observation. The electromagnetic spectrum is far broader than any one instrument can detect, so astronomers/astrophysicists use different sensors; visible light, radio waves, infrared, x-ray, etc. telescopes to detect many of these different pieces of data coming from the same object to gain a better understanding of what they are studying as a whole.

This is why mutations in a gene which cause non-function of the product can be silent if the mutation is heterozygous (only found on one of the alleles), because the effect is masked by the second, fully-functional, copy of the gene. In other cases heterozygous mutations may cause slight phenotypes, because half of the protein produced is non-functional.<\/p>\n\n<p>A small minority of autosomal genes have monoallelic expression, through a process called imprinting. This is where one of the alleles of the gene is modified by methylation of the DNA, or of histones (the proteins which are used to package and condense DNA). This imprinting switches off the expression of that allele, so that protein is only made from the other allele of the gene. Usually in this case, which allele is switched off depends on which parent it came from.<\/p>\n\n<p>Things are slightly more complicated in the case of genes on X or Y chromosomes. Men have only a single X chromosome, and a single Y chromosome. This means that any mutation on X or Y which causes a phenotype will always present itself, because there is no second copy to mask it.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the case of women, who have two X chromosomes and no Y, something similar to imprinting happens, where one of the X chromosomes is chosen to be inactivated. This X-inactivation process occurs very early in development, and the inactive X chromosome is kept that way for the rest of that person's life. In this case, however, the choice of which chromosome is inactivated is not dependent on which parent the chromosome came from, and is entirely random.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Some further reading:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/monoallelic-expression-8813275\">http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/monoallelic-expression-8813275<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-imprinting-and-x-inactivation-1066\">http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-imprinting-and-x-inactivation-1066<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":40334,"question_id":40316,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1446822585}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40316/which-of-the-two-chromosomes-in-a-pair-is-expressed","last_activity_date":1446822585,"creation_date":1446758355,"answer_count":1,"title":"Which of the two chromosomes in a pair is expressed?","body":"<p>I have completely dummy question.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells 23 single coming from my mother and 23 single from my father.

It wasn't until the 1920's that therapeutic experimentation with maggots was instigated by William Baer, a clinical professor in orthopaedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, whose unorthodox methods were successful in the treatment of osteomyelitis and pyogenic wounds. He is also considered the father of modern MDT since he was the first to devise a way to sterilize maggots (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedure<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to removing necrotic tissue from the wound (a procedure known as debridement) maggots have also been proven to disinfect wounds, promote healing, and inhibit a pesky substance known as biofilm from forming on the wound bed. Maggots are nature\u2019s cleansers, showing up to remove dead tissue and promote healing (<a href=\"http://www.thewca.com/blog/201401/%E2%80%9Coh-maggot-where-art-thou%E2%80%9D-quick-history-and-update-maggot-therapy\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently <em>Lucilia sericata<\/em>, or the greenbottle blowfly larvae is preferred for MDT because<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, larvae have been shown to debride wounds with extremely low\n  probability of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myiasis\" rel=\"nofollow\">myiasis<\/a> upon clinical application. Larval secretions\n  have been shown to help in tissue regeneration. <em>L. sericata<\/em> have also\n  been shown to lower bacteremia levels in patients infected with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus\" rel=\"nofollow\">MRSA<\/a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_green_bottle_fly#Medical_importance\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Sterilizing maggots<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In early applications, sterilizing the larvae was a major problem. Doctors had to first bathe the eggs in bleach and then soak them in mercuric chloride or formaldehyde. The bandages, gaudy and cumbersome for the patients, were held in place with either surgical tape or Unna\u2019s paste\u2014made of zinc oxide, gelatin, glycerine, and water. Other problems that doctors faced included the maggots escaping during the application process and the leakage of toxic waste secreted by the maggots into the wound, which led to infections such as tetanus. Today, commercial and research laboratories produce sterile larvae. And instead of the bulky gauze bandage, a form-fitting cast with a nylon net to corral the larvae is placed over the wound. An absorbent pad put on top of the netting soaks up the larvae\u2019s toxic waste products. The number of larvae used has also changed. Early prescriptions ranged from 5\u20136 maggots for a fingertip injury to 500\u2013600 for a more serious wound. Today, the scientific standard of 10 larvae/cm<sup>2<\/sup> is used (<a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v04/i10/html/10health.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>William Baer proposed a method to produce sterilized maggots and it is understood that sterilization has to start from the egg stage in itself (<a href=\"http://jbjs.org/content/16/3/572\" rel=\"nofollow\">reference<\/a>). The sterilization solution that he proposed was.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stock Solution of bichloride of mercury, strength one in 1,000 parts.\n  Stock Solution of fifty per cent. ethyl alcohol. Take equal volume of\n  each Solution, mix, and add one-half of one per cent. chemically pure\n  hydrochloric acid. The final Solution will contain bichloride of\n  mercury, strength one in 2,000 parts, twenty-five per cent. alcohol,\n  and one-half of one per cent. hydrochloric acid.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>He did not sterilize the maggots as such but took care to feed it sterile food.

This is accomplished by negative feedback systems incorporating pressure sensors (i.e., baroreceptors) that sense the arterial pressure. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of external and internal carotids) and in the aortic arch (Figure 1). These receptors respond to stretching of the arterial wall so that if arterial pressure suddenly rises, the walls of these vessels passively expand, which increases the firing frequency of receptor action potentials. If arterial blood pressure suddenly falls, decreased stretch of the arterial walls leads to a decrease in receptor firing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The carotid sinus baroreceptors are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX cranial nerve). The glossopharyngeal nerve synapses in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) located in the medulla of the brainstem. The aortic arch baroreceptors are innervated by the aortic nerve, which then combines with the vagus nerve (X cranial nerve) traveling to the NTS. The NTS modulates the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) neurons in the medulla, which in turn regulate the autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pp9V6.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Of these two sites for arterial baroreceptors, the carotid sinus is quantitatively the most important for regulating arterial pressure. The carotid sinus receptors respond to pressures ranging from 60-180 mmHg (Figure 2). Receptors within the aortic arch have a higher threshold pressure and are less sensitive than the carotid sinus receptors. Maximal carotid sinus sensitivity occurs near the normal mean arterial pressure; therefore, very small changes in arterial pressure around this \"set point\" dramatically alters receptor firing so that autonomic control can be reset in such a way that the arterial pressure remains very near to the set point. This set point changes during exercise, hypertension, and heart failure. The changing set point (response curve shifts to right) explains how arterial pressure can remain elevated during chronic hypertension.<\/p>\n\n<p>Baroreceptors are sensitive to the rate of pressure change as well as to the steady or mean pressure. Therefore, at a given mean arterial pressure, decreasing the pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic pressure) decreases the baroreceptor firing rate. This is important during conditions such as hemorrhagic shock in which pulse pressure as well as mean pressure decreases. The combination of reduced mean pressure and reduced pulse pressure amplifies the baroreceptor response. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Kza8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Although the baroreceptors can respond to either an increase or decrease in systemic arterial pressure, their most important role is responding to sudden reductions in arterial pressure (Figure 3). This can occur, for example, when a person suddenly stands up or following blood loss (hemorrhage). A decrease in arterial pressure (mean, pulse or both) results in decreased baroreceptor firing. Autonomic neurons within the medulla respond by increasing sympathetic outflow and decreasing parasympathetic (vagal) outflow. Under normal physiological conditions, baroreceptor firing exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on sympathetic outflow from the medulla. Therefore, acute hypotension results in a disinhibition of sympathetic activity within the medulla, so that sympathetic activity originating within the rostral ventrolateral medulla increases. These autonomic changes cause vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance, SVR), tachycardia and positive inotropy. The latter two changes increase cardiac output. Increases in cardiac output and SVR lead to a partial restoration of arterial pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>It is important to note that baroreceptors adapt to sustained changes in arterial pressure. For example, if arterial pressure suddenly falls when a person stands, the baroreceptor firing rate will decrease; however, after a period of time, the firing returns to near normal levels as the receptors adapt to the lower pressure. Therefore, the long-term regulation of arterial pressure requires activation of other mechanisms (primarily hormonal and renal) to maintain normal blood pressure.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This information from <strong>PhD Richard E.

Also, the visual system strongly adapts to low and high lighting conditions through <a href=\"http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/adaptation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">light and dark adaptation<\/a>. The <strong>tactile system<\/strong> also shows substantial adaptation, as touch receptors in the skin fail to convey information after prolonged stimulation (you won't feel a watch/ring/band aid etc after wearing it for a while). For example, mechanoreceptors in the skin such as the <a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/M/Mechanoreceptors.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacinian corpuscles<\/a> fail to transmit tactile stimuli when activated for a prolonged time. The <strong>auditory system<\/strong> also adapts to loud sounds by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2504588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cortical mechanisms<\/a> as well as  <a href=\"http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/adaptation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">peripheral mechanisms<\/a> through the middle ear muscles.

The list of adaptational mechanisms provided is not comprehensive, but I just used some obvious examples to show that adaptation occurs in all the senses in a variety of ways. In fact, one of the hallmarks of <em>any<\/em> physiological intact sensory system is the capability to operate over a wide range of stimulus levels. For example, vision operates over a range of intensities differing 8 orders of magnitude, while hearing operates in an intensity range of 10<sup>13<\/sup>. To maintain such an impressive range of input intensities sensory systems have to adapt at various levels. As an analogy, the same applies to your photo camera in which the exposure time has to be regulated in order to take pictures under different lighting conditions. <\/p>\n\n<p>So to come back to your suggestion that smell cannot be revived after continued stimulation while it can be revived with other senses is not true I think.

If your question is &#39;why six &quot;legs&quot;?&#39;, then the answer is &#39;by definition, from common descent&#39;."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bbe3bd8b81991d8ccf5c6763edb1184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":740,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/740/luke","reputation":4547,"display_name":"Luke","accept_rate":69},"score":1,"post_id":39203,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1443783554,"comment_id":65577,"body":"As it stands I agree with @fileunderwater -- this is a question about evolutionary advantages.

It is generally agreed that <strong>insects were derived from many-legged ancestors<\/strong>, e.g. centipedes. <\/p>\n\n<p>One explanation is the <strong>tripod gait<\/strong> that results from having six appendages. This hypothesis, formulated more than 6 decades ago <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Lanham, 1951)<\/a>, reasons that a reduction of the number of legs during evolution did not go further than 6, because locomotion of a small animal encased in a rigid exoskeleton is not effective with less than 3 pairs of legs. Insects generally walk by lifting the two outer legs on one side and the middle on the other side, sweeping them forward and placing them down together. Hence, insects <strong>support their rigid structures with a tripod<\/strong> at all times. <strong>Tripods are<\/strong> among the most <strong>stable<\/strong> configurations, and they never wobble (why on earth do tables have 4 legs?).

Insects' locomotion resembles a double tripod. Insects have a cyclic gait which consists of two phases, the stance phase and the swing phase. The stance phase is the power stroke, it pushes the body forwards in the direction of travel while the leg remains on the ground. Three legs are used is this phase by forming a tripod with the front leg and the hind leg on one side of the body and the middle leg on the other side. This formation is why this gait is known as the tripod gait.

Because insects are so small, their strides are so quick that the nervous system may not be fast enough to deal with gait control. Instead, insects rely on the tripod gait to prevent any imbalance, rather than adjusting it. In addition, the exoskeleton effectively restricts small bodily movements to control balance. Larger animals such as mammals make small adjustments in their gait constantly to maintain balance. An insect has less opportunities to do so, because of their rigid exoskeleton <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Lanham, 1951)<\/a>.    <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/113/2945/663.1.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lanham, <em>Science<\/em> (1951); <strong>113<\/strong>(2946): 663<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":39210,"question_id":39203,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1446211720},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a51980d404d08ba2b8c640ce12120c88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17617,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17617/bshane","reputation":1739,"display_name":"bshane"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1443799686,"creation_date":1443799686,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Apparently, there is an advantage to having 6 legs in the insect world. What is that advantage, if anything? Why would such an advantage exist for insects, but not for other, larger land animals?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Legs\" is a tricky term, with insects. Colloquially, in the terrestrial world, they are things that an organism walks on. But the scientific definition of 'legs', for insects, relies on homology: many insects have six 'legs' because they all descend from a common ancestor, which had six legs. The anatomical structures derived from those legs, regardless of whether they are functionally used as paddles, or as claws, or as feeding appendages or elaborate mate-signalling devices, all get called 'legs'. Referring to all of these as 'legs' makes as much sense, from a functional perspective, as referring to our arms as 'legs'. We only do it to keep the homology clear when talking about evolutionary relationships between species.<\/p>\n\n<p>The diversity of uses to which insects put their legs makes it clear that there is no single universal advantage of having six - it is just that completely losing (or gaining) appendages is a difficult evolutionary process, so it seldom happens over evolutionary time. Regardless, some groups of insects (members of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidae\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coccidae<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspididae\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diaspididae<\/a>, for instance) have lost their legs completely - an apparent adaptation to their obligate parasitic lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What do those middle legs do that the front and hind legs cannot, if anything? Are they really essential, or do they just generate more muscle power? If it's an advantage either way, why don't bigger life forms like mammals have 6 limbs?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the insect groups which use six legs for locomotion, AliceD's answer provides an excellent description of how all six legs are used. However, there really is nothing special which can be achieved with six legs, which could not be achieved with some other number of legs: mantises handle their locomotion perfectly fine on just four of their six legs, and arachnids (not insects, I know - but with many of the same design challenges such as a rigid exoskeleton) manage equally fine on eight.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39211,"question_id":39203,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39203/why-do-adult-insects-have-6-legs","last_activity_date":1446708210,"creation_date":1443763132,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why do adult insects have 6 legs?","body":"<p>Apparently, there is an advantage to having 6 legs in the insect world.

From wikipedia:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The definition of symbiosis is controversial among scientists. Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it should apply to any type of persistent biological interaction (i.e. mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic).[6] After 130+ years of debate,[7] current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter \"de Bary\" definition or an even broader definition (i.e. symbiosis = all species interactions), with the restrictive definition no longer used (i.e. symbiosis = mutualism)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Blurry limits<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Generalities<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It may seem pretty obvious that two species should have either one type or another type of interaction. However, the reality is often more complicated than that. An interaction might fall in one category under one set of environmental conditions and fall under another category under another set of environmental conditions. In addition to that, it is not uncommon that due to selection on the host genes due to the presence of a parasite, the host evolve so to tolerate the presence of the parasite up to the point of actually having a lower fitness in the absence of the parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Example of environment-dependent interaction type<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Consider an animal that is host to an algea. The host is providing shelter to the algea while the algea is providing sugar (produced through photosynthesis). If there is no light or if the enviroment is loaded with sugar, then the host has no gain of hosting the algea. In such case, the algea may even be parasitic. If, however, there plenty of light and there is few nutrients in the environment, then the algea and the host have a mutualist relationship.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Example of the evolution of a parasitic interaction<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Consider for example a snail which is infected by a parasite. Let's assume (I think it is a real world example but I am too lazy to find out a reference) that the parasite need the snail to be eaten in order to reproduce in the body of the predator. In order to improve the chance of its host to be eaten the parasite is selected so to diminish the thickness of the snail's shell. In response to that, there is selection (which intensity depend also on the proportion of infected snails in the population) for having thicker shells. But now, snails that are not infected have shells that are so thick that the can't move as fast as they'd need to forage. So, by the end infected snails may have a higher fitness than non-infected snails. And therefore the interaction between the snail and its parasite is not a parasitic interaction anymore but a mutualistic interaction.<\/p>\n","answer_id":40298,"question_id":40296,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40296/how-to-determine-the-relationship-of-competition-or-cooperation","last_activity_date":1446691838,"creation_date":1446690671,"answer_count":1,"title":"How to determine the relationship of competition or cooperation?","body":"<p>I am currently studying the interaction of Twitter memes (two or many), such as competition and cooperation.

This could be due to the factuality that in some genus's, the males have rougher skin than the females. As well as the skin texture, sometimes male frogs have \"thicker\" and more muscular front limbs than their female counterpart! Considering this, you may now be able to spot one of the reasons towards the theory, of why <a href=\"http://australianmuseum.net.au/blogpost/science/how-can-you-tell-a-male-from-a-female-frog\" rel=\"nofollow\">female frogs are larger in overall size, than males<\/a>. During mating, the male has to fully mount the female which, obviously would cause strain and possible injury. You can relate this to us as humans: if you were to mount (like a frog) your partner and you weigh more than her there's an increasing probability that she will get hurt; unless it's Ronda Roussey -  it would be you getting hurt. Incoherently, there are many variables to consider for example, muscle mass of \"the one taking the weight\".  This could be used to explain how some male mammals are more adapted to mating, by having a longer penis (male sex organ) e.g. a Horse. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, the general rule: the larger the objects mass, the greater the resolved downwards force. To put it briefly. Providing you're on earth, and the force of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity\" rel=\"nofollow\">gravity<\/a> is equal to, 9.80665 NM, that is. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Presumably you used flash to capture the image on the camera, and this sometimes affects identification of the species since, it alters colours slightly and the appearance of certain features.

It's not an exact mathematical answer, but it is basically the same approach as Kimura and Ohta took in (the second half of) their paper, except that my computer is more powerful than their one, so I could get far more precise estimates by simulating more populations than they did.<\/p>\n\n<p>Figure One is a lattice plot of the relationship between P0 and the expected time to reach P1, for different values of P1 (by column) and different population sizes (by row). It is clear that the same relationships between P0, P1 and expected time to get from P0 to P1 are seen in every population size, but with larger populations, you should expect a longer time to get from P0 to P1. <\/p>\n\n<p>When P0 and P1 are close together, you generally expect a smaller time to get from P0 to P1 than when P0 and P1 are far apart. You might think of this as a rule like 'it takes a longer time to travel further'. Expected time taken to get from P0 to P1 is smaller when P0 and P1 are on the same side of 0.5 as each other and P1 is further from 0.5 than P0 is, than when P0 is further from 0.5 than P1 is. You might think of this as a rule like 'it is quicker to travel when you're closer to fixation or extinction, than when you're in the middle frequencies'.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8z3zX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8z3zX.jpg\" alt=\"First-passage time lattice plot\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Figure One: Expected time for a neutral allele to go from frequency P0 to frequency P1, given differences in P0, sub-plotted by P1 and population size. Modelled frequencies of P0 and P1 are 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. Modelled population sizes are N = 10, N = 50, and N = 100. Each sub-plot represents one combination of P1 and population size, with P1 increasing from left to right, and population size increasing from bottom to top. All expectations are estimated from 10,000 simulated populations.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Some populations take longer than others to go from P0 to P1. Generally, most populations take a small number of generations to reach P1, and a smaller number take a long time \u2013 but a very few can take a very very long time. <\/p>\n\n<p>I've attached my code, so if you know how to use R you can use it to estimate the expected time to get from P0 to P1 for any combination of P0, P1, and population size.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional details and assumptions for the technically inclined:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Relevant theory:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In a diploid, sexually-reproducing population of size $N$, there are $2N$ copies of a given locus. Each locus is occupied by some allele. All variation at our locus of interest is selectively neutral. For our purposes, we can consider that each locus is occupied either by our allele of interest ($A$), or another variant ($a$), ignoring variation in the 'other' alleles. The number of copies of $A$ in the population at the start of the process, $A | t=0$, is given by  $2N*P0$.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let us assume that population size is constant ($Nt+1 = Nt$ for all $t$), and that mating is random. Let us further assume that generations are distinct. Let $t = 1$ be the first generation born, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>The expected number of copies of $A$ at time $t+1$ then follows a binomial distribution:<\/p>\n\n<p>$At+1$ is distributed $Binom(2N, At/(2N))$ <\/p>\n\n<p>Since we have a transition rule for $At → At+1$, it is a fairly simple matter to simulate populations undergoing this form of evolution. I have written the R function neutralFPT to carry out this simulation and estimate the proportion of all populations which reach $P1$ at some point in their history, the expected time for a neutral allele to reach $P1$ from $P0$, given that it will reach $P1$, and the distribution of lengths of time taken to reach $P1$, given that a population will reach $P1$.

In this hypothetical state, water mollecules would need to orientate themselves in order to minimize the contact with the hydrophobic tail (wich are very big mollecular gropus who doesn't atract the polar water mollecules) and to maximize the contact with the polar head. If this mollecule finds more mollecules of their kind they will stick together by their hydrophobic tails, because that will reduce the urge to organize water mollecules, and by so, raising the entropy of the system.

A synapse is generally one way, transmitting information from the presynaptic neuron's axon to the postsynaptic neuron's dendrite. I'm sure there's caveats and exceptions because biology always has that, but that's the norm. A simple feedback loop might look like this: A excites B which excites C. C inhibits A as negative feedback.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second question relies pretty heavily on the assumption that conscious thought originates from a particular part of the brain, or that one neuron is dedicated to one concept. This doesn't seem to be true. Things like memory and thought appear to be distributed, emergent properties of several circuits and areas. They might be organized or integrated by a particular part of the brain but it's not the same as having one central executive looking at all the inputs deciding what you think. <\/p>\n\n<p>Think of it like a person working on an Excel spreadsheet. There's all the code for the OS, the software, the formulas in the spreadsheet. Those are all important parts of the process but the user doesn't need to see any of that. All they need to see is the end products of each process, and then they can figure out what to do with those products. So circuits and neurons can be involved in lower processing without connecting directly to the area that organizes and integrates information. Also, because higher level processes like thought are so distributed, there's likely to be multiple centers organizing/integrating information and all giving feedback to each other. Does that make sense?<\/p>\n\n<p>Side note: I think you might be misunderstanding Dale's principle. When it says that neurons have the same chemical action at every synapse, that means they release the same neurotransmitter(s) but that doesn't mean they have to be connected the same way or that the neurotransmitter release has the same results. For example, say a neuron releases the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. If it synapses on another neuron that releases glutamate, that will promote excitation. But if it synapses on an inhibitory neuron that releases GABA, then exciting that neuron will actually result in inhibition. <\/p>\n","answer_id":40247,"question_id":40243,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40243/do-individual-neurons-communicate-with-the-origin-of-thoughts","last_activity_date":1446572825,"creation_date":1446562588,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do individual neurons communicate with the origin of thoughts?","body":"<p>When mapping the different neural pathways in the brain, often pictures such as these are <a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">drawn<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/on4KL.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/on4KL.png\" alt=\"map of neural pathways\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Or <a href=\"http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/images/ebrainmap.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar versions<\/a>. Clearly these sketches draw the neural pathways as being a two-sided connection, as can be judged from the double arrows. I was wondering, how such bidirectional pathways work. Specifically, I am interested to know whether individual neurons constitute such a bidirectional pathway between different parts of the brain, or if the bidirectional pathway can be thought of as a 'circuit': a pathway of neurons that eventually comes back to a certain part of the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>This question is especially interesting in light of abstract thoughts. Let's make some extremely generalising (and ludicrous) assumptions and assume that our conscious thoughts are governed by our hippocampus <em>only<\/em>. That is, we assume that thinking about a matter without input from sensory neurons causes the hippocampus to fire an action potential into some specific cluster of neurons (somewhere in the brain). E.g. we assume that thinking about the letter 'A' causes the hippocampus to fire an action potential into the cluster of neurons that represents the letter 'A'. Let's also assume that the memory we have regarding the letter 'A' must be returned to the hippocampus, in order to continue our thought process. For example, I might want to recite the alphabet in my head. Starting with the letter 'A', I then continue to the letter 'B', which arises in my conscious thoughts as a result of the firing of the cluster of neurons that contain information regarding the letter 'B'.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if we assume the circuit, <em>conscious thoughts<\/em> $\\rightarrow$ <em>cluster of information fires<\/em> $\\rightarrow$ <em>conscious thoughts<\/em> to exist, then how would its feedback <em>most likely<\/em> work?<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's take the example where we think of the letter 'A' and want to think of the letter 'B'. I have sketched two different theories about how the communication between these two clusters of information and the 'governing body of thoughts' (which I assumed to be the hippocampus), might be:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DkRxN.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DkRxN.png\" alt=\"theories about neural pathways\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The difference is the following: in the second theory, all individual neurons are expected to be able to communicate directly to the hippocampus. Whereas in the first theory, the feedback to the hippocampus arises only when we have reached our destination: the letter 'B'. Clearly, if we assume that a specific thought process is able to self-induce action potentials (of course, this is highly debatable), at least one of the two theories must be partially true. For which one exists evidence? <\/p>\n\n<p>My first intuition would be to say that the first theory is more likely, but this is ambiguous under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%27s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dale's principle<\/a>: <em>why would only some cells be connected to the hippocampus?<\/em> On the other hand, I found it hard to believe that <em>every individual neuron<\/em> is directly connected to the hippocampus.<\/p>\n\n<p>So now that I have explained my thought process, my question can be formulated as follows:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How are clusters of neurons that are involved in abstract thoughts bidirectionally connected to the thought-governing-body (whichever actual part(s) of the brain this is)? Can we say that just a single neuron in the cluster provides the feedback to the thought-governing-body, or is every individual neuron that is involved in conscious thought potentially capable of a feedback loop?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><sub>Disclaimer: Yes, I'm not up-to-date to all the latest advances in neuroscience. Yes, I'm aware that my question might be ambiguous with respect to all the different types of neurons, connections and theory about neuronal networks and micronetworks. My question, however, is concerning the likelihood of the theories I presented. For which one do we have evidence. Are both wrong? If so, in what way? Are both right?

Hair cells are involved in changing mechanical energy into changes in membrane potential, a process called transduction. <\/p>\n\n<p>When the cells are displaced and move in the direction of the tallest stereocilium, K+ enters the cell and causes depolarization which allows more transduction channels to open. This depolarization opens voltage gated calcium Ca2+ ion channels. The influx of Ca2+ causes neurotransmitter release from the basal end of the hair cell to the auditory nerve endings which sends signals to the brain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Movement of the hair cells in the opposite direction causes hyperpolarization which prevents influx of K+ and closes the Ca2+ channels at the base resulting in smaller release, or no release of the transmitter. This allows hair cells to generate a sinusoidal receptor potential in response to a sinusoidal stimulus which preserves the temporal information present in the original signal up to frequencies of 3 kHz.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the depolarization and hyperpolarization of hair cells is significant because the constant release of transmitter drives the spontaneous activity in the auditory and vestibular nerve fibers. The interaction of Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ dependent K+ efflux lead to electrical resonances that enhance the tuning response properties within the inner ear.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a more detailed response see: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10867/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10867/<\/a> and <a href=\"http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/psy394U/hayhoe/perception/Chapt.%201%20Hair%20cells%20of%20the%20cochlea%20copy%203.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/psy394U/hayhoe/perception/Chapt.%201%20Hair%20cells%20of%20the%20cochlea%20copy%203.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":39732,"question_id":39729,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1446550995,"creation_date":1446549244,"body":"<p>There are roughly two modes of pitch coding in the cochlea: place-coding and temporal coding. The place-theory is the most prevalent accepted model of how the cochlea realizes pitch coding (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2068911\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zwislocki, 1991<\/a>). Basically, it is based on a frequency-to-place Fourier transformation on the incoming sound, where each frequency is coded on a different place on the basilar membrane, as described accurately in the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is another, much overlooked way of coding pitch, namely <strong>temporal coding<\/strong>. Up until about 1 kHz, spiral ganglion cells in the auditory nerve and acoustical brain stem regions (such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_colliculus\" rel=\"nofollow\">inferior colliculus<\/a>) have been found to respond in a phase-locked pattern <a href=\"http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn/Paper/UsrFile/512.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Du <em>et al<\/em>., 2011)<\/a>. Electrophysiology in auditory nerve fibers illustrates the <a href=\"http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/psych115s/notes/lecture12/\" rel=\"nofollow\">phase-locked<\/a> activity in response to low-frequency sounds (Fig. 1). This phase-locking behavior of neurons in the auditory system is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_following_response\" rel=\"nofollow\">frequency-following response<\/a> (FFR).<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ItWhj.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ItWhj.png\" alt=\"FFR\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>fig. 1.

Source: <a href=\"http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perception/lecturenotes/loudness/loudness.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York University<\/a><\/sup>.   <\/p>\n\n<p>However, as you rightfully state in your question - why would inhibition of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) be helpful? Figure 1 illustrates nicely that the auditory nerve FFR is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)\" rel=\"nofollow\">rectified<\/a>, i.e. only the upper half is coded, while negative action potential counts obviously don't exist; ANFs fire, or they don't, they don't fire negative action potentials. However, one has to realize that a relatively large proportion of ANFs in healthy ears <strong>spontaneously fire<\/strong>, i.e., in the absence of sound the auditory nerve is still remarkably active. Spontaneous firing rates vary from 0 to more than 100 spikes/s <a href=\"http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/carney-lab/publications/res/jacksoncarney-jaro-2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Jackson &amp; Carney, 2005)<\/a>. Hence, <strong>suppression of spontaneous activity codes pitch too<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, as a theoretical and un-referenced side note - the auditory system processes acoustic information on the sub-millisecond level. Left/right sound localization is performed by the auditory system by resolving <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization\" rel=\"nofollow\">inter-aural time differences (ITDs)<\/a>. By analyzing the delay at which sound arrives in one ear with respect to the other, the localization in the horizontal plane can be estimated. ITDs do not exceed <a href=\"http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/courses/perception/lecturenotes/localization/localization.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">0.8 ms<\/a>, given the speed of sound and the size of the human head. This is well below the time it takes for any action potential to develop(!). Hence, by deploying both phases of the sound, one phase being excitatory, the other inhibitory at the ANF level, no time is lost when a sound wave happens to enter the cochlea with its inhibitory flanking phase first.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn/Paper/UsrFile/512.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Du <em>et al<\/em>., <em>Neurosci Biobehav Rev<\/em> (2011)<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/carney-lab/publications/res/jacksoncarney-jaro-2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jackson &amp; Carney, <em>JARO<\/em> (2005); <strong>6<\/strong>: 148\u201359<\/a><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2068911\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zwislocki, <em>Acta Otolaryngol<\/em> (1991); <strong>111<\/strong>(2): 256-62<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":40237,"question_id":39729,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1446550995}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39729/depolarization-and-hyperpolarization-in-stereocilia-of-the-inner-ear","last_activity_date":1446550995,"creation_date":1445167577,"answer_count":2,"title":"Depolarization and hyperpolarization in stereocilia of the inner ear","body":"<p>It\u2019s a well mentioned fact that when the stereocilia of the cochlear hair cells bend in one direction, the hair cell depolarizes, and when the stereocilia bend in the other direction, the cell hyperpolarizes.

In contrast, humans have confounding factors that may reduce weight <em>and<\/em> health (for instance smoking status, early-life diseases, malnutrition, etc) that are not modelled in these experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, the relationship between BMI and mortality is complicated in older humans, known as the 'obesity paradox'; overweight and obese elderly hospital patients have a lower mortality risk than low-normal weight patients [2]. There are a number of hypotheses regarding this, but the favoured one appears to be that the association is not actually paradoxial, but that higher BMI only <em>appears<\/em> protective because losing weight is associated with many diseases of ageing, so after accounting for many of these confounding factors (e.g. dementia, cancer, etc) high BMI no longer appears protective.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore the study you found only appears to be contradictory to the dietary restriction experiments; in human populations the situation is much more complicated.

Thus, this part of the question is hypothetical. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>ERG is performed after pharmacological mydriasis (pupil dilation to ensure retinal mass response or to perform multifocal ERG), so in the standard settings there is no substantial pupils reaction during the test. Thus, this part of the question is hypothetical too.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>ERG measures electrical changes when one of the electrodes is directly attached to the cornea - here we should stress \"to one cornea\", and \"reads\" the current from only one side. This is why, the reaction of contralateral pupil, skeletal muscles, heart/defibrillator activity are irrelevant since they are out of the electrical loop existing between the electrodes (the second electrode is on the forehead).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>ERG measures electrical activity only - there is no muscle contractions in the process, while EMG involves the time needed to acetylcholine to be released and muscle contraction to begin. This means that the time scopes of these tests are different. In addition, as stated, pupils react as an efferent organ (III nerve, mediator related), while retinal photoreceptors react directly to the light stimulation, so there is a clear delay between these two processes. Theoretically, one can perform full cut of the optic nerve with the resultant loss of afferent signal and consequent loss of efferent pupil reaction, but the ERG will still detect the normal curves if the photoreceptors are intact.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Back to question itself: according to the mentioned facts we should state that the question is more hypothetical and theoretical, thus answering it directly is problematic and the answer should not be assessed without facts mentioned above.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, the final answer - 1+2: No, pupil reaction does not affect the ERG in the real and standard settings and should not be counted as an interfering factor.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Version2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I've found an interesting patent claiming that pupillary responses can contribute to eERG (electrical stimulus instead of light).

It is typically recorded from the cornea with a wire electrode or gold-foil electrode. Generally, the the ERG is considered to reflect the retinal processing of a light stimulus, typically a photoreceptor response followed by secondary neuronal activity and electrical activity evoked by supportive Muller cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am wondering if the pupil response will add signal on top of the ERG? Firstly, there is the direct pupil response, which causes the pupil to constrict when the eye is subjected to bright light. Pupil constriction may, perhaps, induce <strong>electromyogram (EMG) activity<\/strong> when the smooth sphincter muscle around the pupil contracts, which in turn could theoretically contaminate the ERG. Secondly, there is <strong>neuronal activity<\/strong> involved in constricting the pupil, as light is processed in the retina by ganglion cells that in turn drive the pupil reflex. Furthermore, there is the consensual pupil response as well. This response causes the contralateral pupil to constrict when the ipsilateral eye is subjected to bright light. The consensual response is mediated by efferent input from the brain following stimulation of the other eye and causes both eyes to restrict. Hence, neural input arrives in the contralateral retina from the brain.

The way I will do this is by explaining a bit about what moon planting is, then I will go through the articles I have found one at a time, to provide the different persepctives on moon planting, as it is called.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What is moon planting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Moon planting is a methodology of planting, in which the lunar cycles are used as guides to know when to plant.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How might it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The first article is a great article about a gardener who tried to do moon planting, but it did not work for her, until she realized she did it wrong. Then, she found out the logic behind why lunae planting <em>works<\/em>. It really doesn't have to do with lunar cycles. Here is her explanation:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let\u2019s look at a possible scenario. Gardener I is a moon planter; Gardener II isn\u2019t. Both gardeners wait till spring to plant their beans. (No sensible cool climate gardener will plant beans in winter. It\u2019s too cold for them to germinate, and many seeds will rot or be taken by ants.) But come the first warm spell Gardener II succumbs to one of the great spring urges and plants the beans at the first hint that spring has arrived. Gardener I, on the other hand, waits till the next good moon planting time before planting the seeds. Early warm spells are usually followed by another cold one\u2026 and again seed planted too early may rot. Even if it doesn\u2019t, plants that suffer any set-back when they are young usually don\u2019t do as well as plants that have flourished right from the start. (The set-back can be from cold, boggy soil, snail or scale attack \u2014 the effect is the same). So counterintuitively, beans that are planted later in spring will probably do better than beans planted too early. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The opposite works too when planting in autumn. By the lunar planting schedule, it is better to grow earlier, and since the soil is warmer, the plants will grow better.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the second article, the author reviews the research done on the effect of lunar cycles on reproduction, germination, and more. However, only the work of a researcher, L. Kolisko, shows evidence for the benefits of lunar planting. Therefore, the conclusion was lunar planting are not significant to affect crop yield.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, in another article, it shows that there are many cycles in plants that are affected by the lunar cycles and that for some organisms, the lunar cycles do affect reproduction, germination, and production of different metabolites. Therefore, lunar planting might have an effect in that way as well.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The conclusion is that lunar planting may actually work, but many scientists are debating about it. So in reality, we aren't 100% percent sure about it, because there is evidence supporting it, and evidence contradicting it. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://danfingerman.com/skeptic/Moon_planting.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://danfingerman.com/skeptic/Moon_planting.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.howplantswork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/beeson_1946.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.howplantswork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/beeson_1946.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.howplantswork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/schad.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.howplantswork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/schad.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":40215,"question_id":40209,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40209/do-lunar-rhythms-have-really-impact-on-plant-growth","last_activity_date":1446502025,"creation_date":1446496992,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do lunar rhythms have really impact on plant growth?","body":"<p>It is commonly known that lunar rhythms have influence on plant growth, and there are even lunar calendars to know when planting, pruning, transplanting, harvesting, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know that the lunar cycles affect the tidal patterns, and this consequently can affect the life of sea organisms like reef corals, fishes, etc., but I am very skeptical that this can affect the growth dynamics or plant physiology.\n I would like to know how it works from a scientific perspective, E.g. the temperature and precipitation are the main limiting factors on plant growth, but I'm curious if the moon light or its magnetic field can also be a limiting factor on plant growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then my question is simple, the lunar rhythms really influence the growth of plants, if so, how?<\/p>\n","question_id":40209,"tags":["botany","plant-physiology","adaptation","cycle"],"score":3,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1446499178},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mcdCa.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":19729,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19729/b-t","reputation":111,"display_name":"B T"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":0,"post_id":40111,"edited":false,"creation_date":1446247273,"comment_id":67352,"body":"It depends on whether it is neutrally or negatively selected (and how strongly so), it depends on the population size, it depends on the mutation rate and mutational variance and - most important of all - it depends on the level of genetic variance for this trait to start with.

Conditioning on fixation, the expected time for fixation to occur is $-4N \\left(\\frac{1-p_0}{p_0}\\right)\\ln(1-p_0)=399998$ generations. In consequence, the expected time to fixation in this case is $10^{5}*10^{9}+399998 ≈ 10^{14}$ generations, that is about 77 times the age of the earth assuming there is one generation per day!

Brain damage is induced due to photo-activation of the dye and subsequent endothelial damage with platelet activation and thrombosis, resulting in local blood flow interruption. The light source can be applied on the intact skull with no need of craniotomy, which allows targeting of any cortical area of interest in a reproducible and non-invasive way <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Labat-Gest &amp; Tomasi, 2013)<\/a>.

The transmitter substance is <strong>glycine<\/strong>, an amino acid which is used frequently in the central nervous system as a transmitter that produces inhibitory actions. It is not the most common, however. The most common transmitter with inhibitory actions is gamma amino butyric acid (GABA).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Glycine receptors<\/strong> activate a <strong>chloride-selective transmembrane channel<\/strong>, which is predominantly expressed in the spinal cord and brain stem <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725896001635\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Rajendra <em>et al<\/em>, 1997)<\/a>. Chloride <strong>hyperpolarizes the neuron<\/strong>, thereby inhibiting the motorneuron controlling the flexor muscle, and thereby facilitating the extensor muscle to contract. If the opposing flexor muscle would not be inhibited, the extensor muscle would be counteracted and the knee jerk reflex would be less efficient, if present at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, an <strong>inhibitory interneuron<\/strong> will only release <strong>inhibitory neurotransmitter<\/strong>. In the example here, the opposite circuit to bend the knee would activate the flexor muscle. This would be accompanied by opposite events. However, the inhibitory F neuron above in your figure would <em>not<\/em> reverse its action though, it will simply be silent, thereby allowing the acetylcholine from the E neuron do its job. In more general terms, neurons cannot reverse their action from <strong>inhibitory to excitatory<\/strong>. Their outputs are typically simply the release of a pre-defined vesicle pool, which is a yes/no event without further qualities. In other words, an inhibitory neuron will be inhibitory and it cannot change the nature of the neurotransmitters released (excitatory versus inhibitory) based on different inputs.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725896001635\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rajendra <em>et al<\/em>, <em>Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics<\/em> (1997), <strong>73<\/strong>(2): 121\u201346<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":40163,"question_id":40157,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1446436143}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40157/how-do-neurons-inverse-an-action-potential","last_activity_date":1446436143,"creation_date":1446379629,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do neurons inverse an action potential?","body":"<p>See the following figure (<a href=\"http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cuv1Q.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cuv1Q.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The pathway on the right (SN $\\rightarrow$ interneuron $\\rightarrow$ F Neuron $ \\rightarrow $ flexor muscle), is explained as follows:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The action potential in the sensory neuron invades the synaptic terminal of the sensory neuron causing the release of transmitter, and subsequent excitation of the postsynaptic interneuron colored black.

From there you would need to run some form of microarray to detect what it is that you are pulling down. So, no, unless you are putting primers in for specificity for the microorganism you have, you should not get amplification, unless you use random primers."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":40175,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1446554812,"comment_id":67570,"body":"@canadianer That is false. <a href=\"http://www.neb.sg/applications/cloning-and-synthetic-biology/dna-analysis/colony-pcr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colony PCR<\/a> can allow amplification of bacterial DNA even when the bacteria are added into the PCR mixture while still alive and viable, and the same applies to mammalian cell culture."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fcf9d3bdac2c3fa35177730c31b34f79?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6307,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6307/canadianer","reputation":6147,"display_name":"canadianer"},"score":0,"post_id":40175,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1446562610,"comment_id":67583,"body":"@MarchHo Nowhere in that description do I see PCR conducted inside living organisms."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0329819d1cfd8d00c4bddc535abe1c94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19770,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19770/b-m","reputation":113,"display_name":"B M"},"score":0,"post_id":40175,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1446672119,"comment_id":67700,"body":"@MarchHo canadianer is basically correct: the KIT you have linked uses denaturation of proteins at mostly 95&#176;C as described in the instructions.

You've given a good justification for dendrites---an efficient way to fit lots of connections in a small space. A pyramidal neuron in cortex, for instance, will have tens of thousands of synapses. If you only had axosomatic connections, the soma would have to be enormous to fit all of them (and this would cause lots of other issues).<\/p>\n\n<p>Dendritic structure also allows the cell more efficient electrical properties (see cable theory) and to process inputs independently. In fact, different parts of the dendrite are now thought of as independent computational compartments. For instance, the cell might want to selectively strengthen a single synapse or all the synapses on one dendritic branch. By physically isolating those synapses in small dendritic structures, it is easier to make those targeted changes without unwanted \"crosstalk\" on other synapses or cell activities. What's more, incoming connections from different areas often segregate into regions of the dendrite (e.g. in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, cortical connections to the most distant part of the dendrite, internal hippocampal connections to the part of the dendrite closer to the soma).<\/p>\n\n<p>When a cell has a large dendrite (some neurons have no dendrites), its useful to think of axodendritic synapses as the normal inputs that contribute to fine-grained computation, and axosomatic and axoaxonic synapses as more global gates.

This neurotransmitter can be excitatory or inhibitory, the main excitatory one being <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate\">glutamate<\/a> and the main inhibitory one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA\">GABA<\/a>.<sup>*<\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>GABA and Glu are far from being the only neurotransmitters in the brain, they're just a classic example, so we'll stick with them. When the neurotransmitter is released it binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron (provided, of course, that the postsynaptic neuron expresses these receptors).<\/p>\n\n<p>Various GABA and Glu receptors exist, both ionotropic (i.e. channel-receptors that let ions flow through the membrane upon binding of the ligand) and metabotropic (i.e. receptors which activate an intracellular pathway that does not <em>per se<\/em> start the flow of ions, but that can induce it or prevent it indirectly).\nFor simplicity we'll stick to ionotropic receptors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Glu binds to three types of ionotropic receptors: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA_receptor\">AMPA<\/a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor\">NMDA<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kainate_receptor\">kainate<\/a> receptors. These have different kinetics/properties, but the bottom line is that they let cations (positively charged ions, such as Na+ and Ca++) into the cell. When this happens a postsynaptic depolarization happens, which is named EPSP (excitatory post-synaptic potential).<br>\nSo, if the resting membrane potential was, say, -57mV, it will become, for instance -52mV. \nThis means that, if the threshold potential for firing an action potential were -43mV the cell, which first needed a 14mV depolarization to fire now will need a 9mV depolarization.\nIf subsequent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential\">EPSP<\/a> sum they can depolarize the cell sufficiently to reach threshold and let the cell fire.<\/p>\n\n<p>This image from Wikipedia is quite self-explicatory: in this case 3 synaptic events generated 3 EPSPs that summed, making the cell depolarize enough to reach threshold potential, and generate an action potential, that will then propagate to the cell body.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cdiDk.png\" alt=\"Sum of EPSP\"><\/p>\n\n<p>GABA, on the other hand, binds to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA-A\">GABA-A<\/a> receptor, which is a chloride channel. In most cases, upon binding of GABA, GABA-A lets Cl- in the cell, effectively hypopolarizing it and generating an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential\">IPSP<\/a> (inhibitory post-synaptic potential). The situation is the same (but opposite) to Glu, this time, though, the potential becomes more negative.<\/p>\n\n<p>EPSP and IPSP can and do happen at the same time: as they can vary in frequency and intensity depending on the firing frequency and firing pattern of the presynaptic neuron, a pretty much continuous range of voltages can be achieved in the postsynaptic neuron.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other controls over this process come from metabotropic receptors that can, for instance [de]phosphorylate (add or remove a phosphate group) ion channels modulating their permeability to ions or from the different kinetics of the different channels (for instance certain channels stay open for longer or open in a delayed manner etc), allowing for fine-tuning of the system. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>*<\/sup>I am making a gross generalization here.

The cable equation describes how the voltage will change over time and space along a cable. The theory was originally developed for signal decay in trans-Atlantic telegraph cables, but the principle holds for a voltage-independent length of membrane like a dendrite. <\/p>\n\n<p>A key point is that the potential change \"seen\" by the cell body <em>is<\/em> different from the potential change seen locally at the site of the synapse itself. In fact, the voltage decays exponentially with increasing distance from the synapse. The extent of the signal decay is governed by the axial resistance (influenced by dendritic diameter), the membrane resistance, and membrane capacitance, and the branching pattern. A common neuron modeling environment called <a href=\"http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NEURON<\/a> is basically a fancy solver for the cable equation.<\/p>\n\n<p>You'll note that a consequence of this signal decay is that synaptic location matters a lot. Given an identical synaptic potential, a very distal synapse will have much less of an effect on the soma than a more proximal dendrite. Sometimes, the synaptic strengths are scaled to compensate for this location issue (a distal synapse will have a much larger local potential change). Many inhibitory synapses capitalize on this location dependence and are located close to the soma to act as shunts for all signals coming from the dendritic tree. When activated, an inhibitory synapse will decrease the local membrane resistance thereby decreasing cell excitability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'll note that although we often talk about dendrites as being passive conductors, dendrites are actually quite active and have many voltage-dependent channels. The voltage-dependent phenomena in the dendrite complicates the use of pure cable theory to understand the dynamics of synaptic potentials. However, cable theory is still the essential foundation upon which our growing understanding of the active dendrite is built.<\/p>\n","answer_id":852,"question_id":849,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1446406391}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/849/how-does-an-inhibitory-synapse-communicate-to-the-cell-body-of-a-neuron","last_activity_date":1446406391,"creation_date":1327904262,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does an inhibitory synapse communicate to the cell body of a neuron?","body":"<p>I picture a neuron as having multiple trees of dendrites attached to the cell body with a single axon leaving the cell body.

As this is where most of our development is obviously done, I do not know where I can further proceed with the question about how it would affect development?  Perhaps the issue is more how it would effect the day to day performance of a developed individual?  If this is the case then it is suggested by Dr Wozniak that this is likely to be highly disruptive to the individual <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those well-defined effects of natural sleep affecting stimuli on sleep patterns lead to an instant conclusion: the claim that humans can adapt to any sleeping pattern is false. A sudden shift in the schedule, as in shift work, may lead to a catastrophic disruption of sleep control mechanisms. 25% of North American population may work in variants of shift schedule. Many shift workers never adapt to shifts in sleep patterns. At times, they work partly in conditions of harmful disconnect from their body clock, and return to restful sleep once their shift returns to their preferred timing. At worst, the constant shift of the working hours results in a loss of synchrony between various physiological variables and the worker never gets any quality sleep. This propels an individual on a straight path to a volley of health problems...<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>It appears that polyphasic sleep encounters the precisely same problems as seen in jet lag or shift-work. Human body clock is not adapted to sleeping in patterns other than monophasic or biphasic sleep.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It would therefore seem that polyphasic sleep is certainly detrimental to health, if not development.<\/p>\n\n<p>However studies into cognitive performance resulting from differing sleep patterns run by Dr Claudio Stampi (Published <a href=\"http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf\">ISBN 0-8176-3462-2<\/a>), he concluded that polyphasic sleep was more efficient than monophasic sleep.  Therefore it may be possible that polyphasic sleep patterns have no detrimental effect on development.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Individuals sleeping for 30 minutes every four hours, for a daily total of only 3 hours of sleep, performed better and were more alert, compared to when they had 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a couple of theories mentioned in the above book (beginning pg 5) which support the development of monophasic sleep as evolution rather than a social convention:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Polyphasic sleep is regularly seen in smaller mammals that have very high metabolic rates, requiring them to spend most of their time foraging or hunting.  Therefore a long sleep would be highly impractical for them as they would wake without the energy required to hunt their next meal. Humans do not have this need as they are larger and do not require such regular meals.<\/li>\n<li>Monophasic sleep would be beneficial for the early human hunter gatherer as our eyes are not well adapted to see at night.  Therefore any time spent not using the daylight is wasted and any time without the light is not nearly as useful.  This makes it more beneficial to sleep for an extended period when the sun is down.  <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I am sure that social factors would have an effect, however I would imagine the evolutionary pressures to be more significant.<\/p>\n\n<p>I really would recommend the book (<a href=\"http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf\">http://sleepwarrior.com/Claudio_Stampi_-_Why_We_Nap.pdf<\/a>) if you have not yet encountered it as I found it very informative and packed with references to studies that you may find helpful. <\/p>\n","answer_id":366,"question_id":319,"up_vote_count":6}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/319/effects-of-polyphasic-vs-monophasic-sleep-in-humans","last_activity_date":1446365482,"creation_date":1324705273,"answer_count":1,"title":"Effects of Polyphasic vs Monophasic sleep in humans","body":"<p>Why do humans practice monophasic sleep cycles? <\/p>\n\n<p>When altering one's circadian rhythm to a Polyphasic sleep schedule, how much would that affect development?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is Monophasic sleep (once per day) chosen because of biological evolution or is it due to cultural influence?<\/p>\n","question_id":319,"tags":["human-biology","sleep"],"score":9,"accepted_answer_id":366,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4177,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1325652226}]}
