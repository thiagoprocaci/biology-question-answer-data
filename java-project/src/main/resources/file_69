This is what a receptor put in that specific position will sense: a disturbance (here it's the height of a string, in your case the amplitude of the electric field) changing $\\nu$ times per second.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wavelength, on the other hand, tells you how far the maxima and minima of the sinusoid are separated in the medium. In this case, two subsequent crests are separated by $\\lambda$ meters. For a given disturbance frequency, this number depends on how fast the wave is allowed to travel in the medium. A slow wave will have a shorter wavelength (because it will travel a smaller distance in space during the time the red dot completes a cycle); conversely, a fast wave will have a longer wavelength.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: the speed can depend on the frequency of the disturbance - in that case the medium is said to be 'dispersive' and the relation between frequency and wavelength (or energy and momentum, or - if you are into quantum physics - between energy E and wavenumber k) is called a '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation\" rel=\"nofollow\">dispersion relation<\/a>'.<\/p>\n\n<p>In an isotropic homogeneous medium, the speed is the same in every point and in any direction and you can write<\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\lambda(\\nu) = c(\\nu) / \\nu $$<\/p>\n\n<p>The frequency is determined by the physical process in the source.

For example, Chevron's DA model started 1990 and continuing, implementation takes time. For example, scale hydration level to some level in all samples. When you have low-quality information, you need to use ad hoc models (often based on high-quality samples) such as supposed correlations between things to improve prediction accuracy. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1.1.

Lower end PCR testing uses 10uL of sample.  This is ok when you are trying to bring molecular diagnostics to the point of care or developing markets, but the best PCR tests use 50uL of sample (more than a drop of blood which is traditionally 25uL or so),  regardless of how good your device is, at some point you start amplifying junk. The better the primers and other reagents the less junk you amplify, but at the end of the day you want more sample to be more sensitive.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>From a NON-molecular standpoint (chemistries, cellular analysis, coag, etc.), they aren't/can't multiply the analyte of interest.  In these tests, they rely more on dilution or small volumes to perform detection.  This is where their ability to reliably dilute and correct for the dilution comes into play. Although there is certain limits to this.  Coagulation tests would not be representative if you diluted the sample so in this case they will have to rely on working with a small volume.  Cellular analysis can only be diluted so much as you get to a point where you miss important but less common cell types.  Take eosinophils (a type of WBC) while they can get to 15 or 20 percent of all WBC cell types, in general they only make up a couple percent.  Assume that 2% of all your WBCs are eosinophils.  If you only have 3500 WBCs per 1uL of blood (which is on the lower end of normal), you have approximately only 70 of these cells in that same volume.  If you dilute the sample so that way there is more of it available for other tests like electrolytes, but you still analyze 1uL, The number of those cells is even less.  If you had perfect detection you might be ok, but you generally want to analyze more blood so that statistics work in your favor and your performance goes up. Most of the other chemistries, proteins, and as mentioned earlier, electrolytes will probably be ok for dilution and detection and in fact this is why there are plenty of small devices already out there that use a drop of blood and perform the same tests.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Their issue in diluting or amplifying analytes of interest is that biology still is governed by the laws of physics and even though technology may allow you to analyze samples down to 10nL, that just isn't use full in biology, and limits their their capability to perform the supposed menu of tests from one microtainer of blood.  They don't publicize that they may need to draw a venous sample (needle in your arm) for some tests and depending on what tests you order, you may need a separate finger prick for each test. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>How can Theranos blood test's be specific and accurate compared to conventional full blood test?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If they reliably control dilution of the small sample, they maybe able to provide high quality results for some tests.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Finger pricks actually can be easily skewed via technique.  Theranos has specially trained people to draw these samples, but it is time consuming >5 mins and until it is fully automated this is one variable that no matter how good sensors are, you can't correct for variation pre-analytically when you have that small sample.  Finger pricks also skew certain tests even when technique is good such as platelet and WBC values in the CBC.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I discussed the sample volume issue above regarding PCR amplification and how good tests use up to 50uL.  So if they compare to a 10uL test, they may be able to compete, but not full lab quality.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>A lot of the future techniques they have regarding small techniques (in their applications) like their coagulation tests work great in an academic setting, but they fail to be able to handle the full range of blood samples they will see, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Theranos is working on modular micofluidic devices/cartridges that will use small sample<\/li>\n<li>There are certain biological limitations that stand in the way of them performing all the tests in their catalog with only a drop of blood<\/li>\n<li>The FDA will eventually be requiring them to submit their tests for approval as they are currently doing tests that are available on commercially and FDA approved devices already (this makes sense because LDTs were never ment to be used in place of standard tests and equipment and since there is NO published data on their performance it can be worrisome to providers and payer)<\/li>\n<li>Their true business plan has yet to be elucidated, but if they really did have a box that did all this, they would be selling them to physicians and clincs where those results could actually be used in diagnosis rather than 4 hours later.<\/li>\n<li>I hope they succeed, but there is just way too much hype to buy in on it yet.    <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I am sorry I don't have sources, most of this is from intimate knowledge of the space and from the little info available on them so I could definitely be wrong on some of this.

According to serveral wikipedia articles IL-17 induces the production of other cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α. IL-21 is required for sustained CD8+ T cell effector activity. IL-22 is a mediator of cellular inflammatory responses. IL-6 modulates the resistance of T cells against apoptosis, induces activation of T helper cells and promotes osteoclastogenesis. TNF-α is an endogenous pyrogen which is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and inhibits tumorigenesis and viral replication.

Sadly it failed the clinical trials, it had only mild effect. It probably does not reach the inflammation in sufficient amount. Maybe later there will be an effective delivery method and so a drug which can be taken orally.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are alternative natural therapies: TNF-α inhibitors which you can take orally, for example γ-linolenic acid, ω−3 fatty acids, chondroitin sulfate, etc... These can be useful by mild cases of RA. Probably fever therapy works by mild cases as well. Afaik. cryotherapy has nice results in treating RA and its positive effect lasts much longer than the effects of any drugs, so if you aren't afraid of cold, that is a nice alternative therapy as well.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2013 - <a href=\"https://www.oapublishinglondon.com/article/494\" rel=\"nofollow\">The interleukin-23/interleukin-17 axis and the role of Treg/Th17 cells in rheumatoid arthritis and joint destruction<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2010 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02361.x/pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL-23 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2003 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2567.2003.01749.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid inhibits tumour necrosis factor-α production by human leucocytes independently of cyclooxygenase activity<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2011 - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159111004685\" rel=\"nofollow\">Omega-3 supplementation lowers inflammation and anxiety in medical students: A randomized controlled trial<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2006 - <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja061906t\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discovery of a TNF-α Antagonist Using Chondroitin Sulfate Microarrays<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01645280\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Ustekinumab (STELARA) and CNTO 1959 Administered Under the Skin of Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis, Despite Existing Methotrexate Therapy<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2014 - <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1586/1744666X.2014.870036\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cryotherapy in inflammatory rheumatic diseases: a systematic review<\/a><\/li>\n<li>2012 - <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.34339/pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Phase IIa, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of\nApilimod Mesylate, an Interleukin-12/Interleukin-23 Inhibitor, in Patients With\nRheumatoid Arthritis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":24524,"question_id":11025,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11025/how-does-humira-work-when-injected-into-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis","last_activity_date":1417662446,"creation_date":1382473941,"answer_count":2,"title":"How does Humira work when injected into patients with rheumatoid arthritis?","body":"<p>OK, I have rheumatoid arthritis and I've been injecting Humira 2 times a month for the last 8 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know rheumatoid arthritis is simply an immune system disorder which makes the immune system produce more proteins called Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha which regulate body disorders.\nWhen I inject Humira I actually import a protein called Adalimumab which is a TNFα inhibitor.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far so good but my question is <\/p>\n\n<p>Does my body throw this protein away after some time?

Please forgive me for repeating information you may already know.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two main families of acetylcholine receptors: muscarinic and nicotinic. Acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are exclusively nicotinic (N<sub>1<\/sub> or N<sub>M<\/sub>), so that's the only receptor I'll address.<\/p>\n\n<p>Myasthenia Gravis is caused by an immune response to nicotinic postsynaptic receptors on skeletal muscle. An antibody can either destroy or block the receptor site. The antibodies destroy the receptor sites more rapidly than the body can replace them. In MG, there can be as much as an 80% reduction in the number of these receptor sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic cleft. AChE has a remarkably high specific catalytic activity: each molecule of AChE degrades about 25000 molecules of ACh per second. Any drug which serves to inhibit AChE will increase ACh concentration at the N<sub>1<\/sub> receptor. AChE inhibitors can be irreversible or reversible. Reversible inhibitors, (competitive or noncompetitive) have therapeutic applications; irreversible AChE  modulators are toxic. <\/p>\n\n<p>Carbamates are organic compounds derived from carbamic acid (NH2COOH). They are reversible AChE inhibitors. This group includes neostigmine, pyridostigmine and physostigmine. Pyridostigmine is an analog of neostigmine, so has the same basic mechanism of action. Because they are not lipid soluble, they are selective for the NMJ; both also have direct action on Nm Receptors.

Often it indicates when one's basic boundaries are violated. Sheila Videbeck describes anger as a normal emotion that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Anger may have physical correlates such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline.

While our understanding of the chemical interactions underlying the stress response has increased vastly in recent years, much remains poorly understood. The roles of two peptide hormones, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine-vassopressin (AVP), have been widely studied. Stimulated by an environmental stressor, neurons in the hypothalamus secrete CRH and AVP.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>CRH, a short polypeptide, is transported to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates the secretion of corticotropin (4). Consequently, corticotropin stimulates increased production of corticosteroids including cortisol, the primary actor directly impacting the stress response (5). Vasopressin, a small hormone molecule, increases reabsorption of water by the kidneys and induces vasoconstriction, the contraction of blood vessels, thereby raising blood pressure.\n  <a href=\"http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/fall-2010/the-physiology-of-stress-cortisol-and-the-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis#.VH7k8cnQoX0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/fall-2010/the-physiology-of-stress-cortisol-and-the-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis#.VH7k8cnQoX0<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bmqcb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":24498,"question_id":24492,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24492/how-does-anger-relate-to-blood-pressure","last_activity_date":1417606779,"creation_date":1417597587,"answer_count":1,"title":"How does anger relate to blood pressure?","body":"<p>Anger is an emotion generated by neural processes in the brain and is associated with elevated blood pressure.

Depending on what you want to do with your cloned gene, you need different strategies. The method is based on the assumption that the gene sequence has only very little differences to the known sequences of other organisms.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to express your gene from a vector, you need to find the right processed mRNA which is then processed into cDNA and then cloned. Here two strategies are possible: If you have a gene, which is strongly expressed, you can design a primer primer (based on the orthologous sequences) which is anchored in the poly-A tail and has a gene specific seuqence next to it. With this it should be possible to amplify your gene specifically and isolate it. If the gene is not strongly expressed (the resulting amount of cDNA would be very small, since there is no amplification involved), I would opt for making cDNA from total mRNA (use anchored polyA primers) and then amplify the sequence from the cDNA pool with two primers (again based on the orthologous sequences) to amplify the gene sequence. I would go for TA-cloning here, since you do not know, which restriction enzyme recognition sites are present on your gene.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you need the complete sequence containing introns and exons, there are two possible strategies. First you can use primers to amplify the gene and subsequently clone it. Then it is possible (and this is probably what I would do) to use a set of primers which bind to the end of the gene (and also the reverse strand) to amplify the sequences at the end and then sequence these PCR products. This gives you the exact sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the gene and allows you to include possible regulatory sites, since you then can design exactly matching primers for this region. Again, I would go for TA cloning.<\/p>\n\n<p>And finally you could start by sequencing the whole region based on homologous sequence primers first and then with primers designed on the newly analyzed sequences. This is the most exact way, but is also costly and takes some time (since you need to make new primers after each round of sequencing until you are done).<\/p>\n","answer_id":24494,"question_id":16220,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16220/cloning-a-gene-of-an-organism-with-an-nonsequenced-genome","last_activity_date":1417599650,"creation_date":1396191516,"answer_count":1,"title":"Cloning a gene of an organism with an nonsequenced genome","body":"<p>What would be the best protocol to clone a gene about 5kb in size?

These include (1) a semidominant gene for whorls on the thumbs (one homozygote has whorls on both thumbs, the other homozygote has ulnar loops on both thumbs, and the heterozygote has two ulnar loops or one ulnar loop and one whorl); (2) a semidominant gene for whorls on the ring fingers that acts like the gene for whorls on the thumbs; (3) a dominant gene for arches on the thumbs and often on other fingers; (4) one or more dominant genes for arches on the fingers; (5) a dominant gene for whorls on all fingers except for an ulnar loop on the middle finger; (6) a dominant gene for radial loops on the index fingers, frequently associated with an arch on the middle fingers; and (7) a recessive gene for radial loops on the ring and little fingers.

If you care about humans, though, yup, males can lactate just fine (though I have no idea about the amount or quality of milk so produced)."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zh52G.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10294,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10294/jayachandran","reputation":1408,"display_name":"Jayachandran","accept_rate":71},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":1,"post_id":24469,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417526806,"comment_id":39192,"body":"The last sentence in your wikipedia quote is contradicting the first sentence in your answer."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zh52G.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10294,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10294/jayachandran","reputation":1408,"display_name":"Jayachandran","accept_rate":71},"score":0,"post_id":24469,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1417527063,"comment_id":39193,"body":"@fileunderwater: I saw it but it may be because they just used &quot;vestigial&quot; as an inappropriate organ(literal sense)they may not be thinking the controversy in using &quot;vestigial&quot; and &quot;rudimentary&quot;."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5upF.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3624,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3624/fileunderwater","reputation":10502,"display_name":"fileunderwater"},"score":1,"post_id":24469,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417527809,"comment_id":39197,"body":"I rather see it as a reason to have healthy scepticism towards unreferenced statements in Wikipedia.

At the time of fertilization, the father can provide either X or Y chromosome. If he provides Y chromosome the child will be male and if he provides X then child will be female. The mother always provides X chromosome. So the Y chromosome in the male child is responsible for the development of male sex organs and due to the presence of X chromosome the female sex organs are suppressed. Note that the female organs are suppressed but they are not eliminated. At the time of puberty males don't receive hormones which initiate the development of female sex organs. As a result the mammary glands stay in males as nipples but the hormone effects are only present in females and cause the formation of large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples and develop as breasts.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A distinguishing characteristic of the class Mammalia is the presence of mammary glands.

I'll explain QSSA and EA using the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics.<\/p>\n\n<p>MM considers following steps:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enzyme-Substrate binding (Reversible): $ E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES $ with forward rate constant <strong><em>k<sub>1<\/sub><\/em><\/strong> and reverse rate constant <strong><em>k<sub>2<\/sub><\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Enzyme-Substate complex converting to Product and Enzyme (Irreversible): $ ES \\to P + E$ with rate constant <strong><em>k<sub>3<\/sub><\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><br> <br><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EA<\/strong> (The actual MM model): <br>\nAssuming step 1 is in equilibrium. $k_1[E][S]=k_2[ES]$\n<br> Get <strong>[<em>ES<\/em>]<\/strong> in terms of <strong>[<em>E<\/em>]<\/strong> and <strong>[<em>S<\/em>]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>QSSA<\/strong> (The revised MM mddel):<br>\nAssuming <strong>[<em>ES<\/em>]<\/strong> is in steady state. ${\\Large \\frac{d[ES]}{dt}}=k_1[E][S]-k_2[ES]-k_3[ES] = 0$ <br> which means $[ES] = \\Large \\frac{k_1[E][S]}{k_2+k_3}$<\/p>\n\n<p>This way you have removed certain reactions from the model.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can do stochastic modeling as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>For simulations you can use Matlab or Fortran. <\/p>\n","answer_id":24459,"question_id":21645,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1417523708}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21645/modeling-intracellular-interactions-between-sender-and-receiver-bacteria","last_activity_date":1417523708,"creation_date":1411650788,"answer_count":1,"title":"Modeling intracellular interactions between sender and receiver bacteria","body":"<p>I am involved in a modelling task of a biological process described as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>--\n\"Objective: to model behavior of a sender receiver type system<\/p>\n\n<p>The process goes as follows<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Pre-signal [PS] is in media<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Pre-signal diffuses into bacteria<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Pre-signal binds to activator as a co-activator<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Co-activator activator complex binds to DNA and starts transcription of enzyme mRNA<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enzyme mRNA is transcribed then translated into enzyme<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enzyme begins converting Pre-signal to signal [S]<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Signal diffuses out of the cell into media<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Signal diffuses into receiver cell from media<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Signal binds to repressor inducing activation of reporter gene<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Questions for model:<\/p>\n\n<p>What concentrations of signal will be required to get a response from receiver cell?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>--<\/p>\n\n<p>My questions are: what kind of mathematical/computational model or simulation tool is more suitable for this task? is it neccesary to model every step, or can some of these be ignored?

Before answering the question I think you're getting at, I'll first note that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid\" rel=\"nofollow\">cannabinoids<\/a> (of which THC is one) are primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochromes rather than being excreted directly. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3012605\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> is a classical pharmacokinetic paper on the topic if you\u2019re able to access it; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one<\/a> is a more recent general review accessible on Pubmed Central. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cannabinoid metabolites are excreted both renally (via kidneys) and in the feces, so I\u2019ll understand your question to refer to the renally excreted portion.

If ADH is completely suppressed, the kidneys can produce up to 25 L/day of urine with an osmolality as low as 60 mOsm/kg.<sup>2,3<\/sup> This huge volume of urine, however, reflects water homeostasis achieved at the distal tubule rather than increased glomerular filtration.

This degenerative disorder is precipitated by the death of neurons in the substantia niagra. This brain structure is composed of multiple neurological nuclei. Its function is to connect cortical regions and nuclei together, most significantly with the basal ganglia. The difference between nuclei and cortical brain circuits is important to your question. <\/p>\n\n<p>The symptoms of Parkinson's are directly correlated with the function of nuclei in central nervous system: the integration of information. It's the integration of conscious thought, muscle memory, sensory-motor pathways that makes voluntary movement possible. Disruption of this network in Parkinson's degrades one's ability to voluntarily execute a movement.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cerebellum also controls voluntary movement. As a cortical structure, it is involved more with the formation and maintenance of muscle memory than information integration. Damage here results in the loss of fine motor control as opposed to gross motor control in Parkinson's. <\/p>\n\n<p>This problem has a sensory and motor component. It might be difficult to tackle your problem as a whole.

It is also questionable, if this protective effect is present at all. There are around 40 studies on the topic available which have subsequently undergone meta-analysis. In a meta-analysis all data from recent studies which meet certain quality criteria are analysed together. This gives a much bigger dataset and stronger statistical data. It also helps eliminating the effects of too small test groups.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of these meta-analysis identified circumcision to have a positive effect on the prevention of HIV infections (reference 1). The authors recommended considering it as a preventive measure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two other meta-analysis were more cautious on the topic and either found only a weak link (reference 2) or that only \"randomized control studies\" (reference 3) would provide clear data. The problem with all these studies is, that they are observational studies, where unknown other effects can play a bigger role than the supposed main effect. It is ethically very difficult to make controlled trials on the transmission of deadly diseases in humans. This is also the reason why all trials on this have been stopped.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a hypothesis on how circumcision may help preventing the infection with HIV (when you not get infected in the operation itself due to improper hygienic standards). The skin in the penis contains a large number of immune cells (dendritic cells, CD4/CD8-T-cells) which are the target cells of the HIV virus. It is thought that the virus can more easily penetrate the relatively thin skin of the foreskin. It is also possible, that the surface size is important here, as there are reports which show that men with a larger foreskin also have a larger risk of getting infected. See reference 4.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another hypothesis has to do with the with the bacteria which live under the foreskin. The number of different strains present is much lower in circumcised men, which led to the conclusion that the dendritic cells, which present these to the immune system have an easier job in the circumcised men and are more likely to prevent the infection with HIV.\nSee reference 5 and 6 for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2000&amp;issue=10200&amp;article=00018&amp;type=abstract\">Male circumcision and risk of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa: a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://apps.who.int/rhl/reviews/langs/CD003362.pdf\">Male circumcision for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV\nin men<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3820/6krnh2wf_pdf.htm\">HIV and male circumcision--a systematic review with assessment of\nthe quality of studies.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042054\">Male circumcision for HIV prevention: current research and\nprogrammatic issues.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/17/why-circumcision-lowers-risk-of-hiv/\">Why Circumcision Lowers Risk of HIV<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/2/e00076-13.full\">Male Circumcision Significantly Reduces Prevalence and Load of\nGenital Anaerobic Bacteria<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":24372,"question_id":24370,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002216540067/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":10375,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10375/hugh-young","reputation":21,"display_name":"Hugh Young"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":24407,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417337357,"comment_id":39035,"body":"One of the first proponents that circumcision could be helpful is indeed a strong advocate of circumcision."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWL7o.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9268,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9268/susan","reputation":2544,"display_name":"Susan"},"score":1,"post_id":24407,"edited":false,"creation_date":1417361263,"comment_id":39046,"body":"This doesn&#39;t seem to me to really answer the question (which is about a hypothetical biologic mechanism), although it&#39;s relevant and interesting.

Virtually any male researcher into this topic has a vested interest in vindicating his own penile condition. Men feel strongly about the perfection of their own penises, however they find them.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is very clear from the discussion and tone of many of these studies that the researchers are themselves circumcised, and want circumcision to be treated as the norm. The same effect is possible in the other direction, but seems to occur to a lesser extent because intactness is the biological norm and requires no action to make it so. <\/p>\n\n<p>For that reason, studies out of the USA (including those led by American researchers in Africa) disproportionately favour circumcision, while those out of Europe do not. One reason this bias can creep in is that it is difficult to do double-blinded and/or placebo-controlled trials of circumcision. Thus experimenter and experimentee effects can creep in at every stage. <\/p>\n\n<p>Circumcision is an intervention with deep social, religious, historical and cultural roots, and once it has become customary, rationality about it is difficult to achieve. Especially considering the operation on healthy infants, the fact that the foreskin is an integral part of an adult sexual organ gets lost from sight. <\/p>\n\n<p>It is very common for the circumcised penis to be treated as the norm (with terms like \"uncircumcised\" common, where \"normal\" \"whole\" or \"intact\" would apply to any other body part that had not been surgically reduced). After that, circumcision may be treated as equal and opposite to the alternative of doing nothing, when it is no such thing.

In order to make the connection that \"I am the being in the mirror\" and that every action I do will be reflected in the mirror (or, <em>vice versa<\/em>, every action I see the being in the mirror take is a reflection of my own action), one must first have a concept of self. One requires a constant present-tense (at least) story of oneself: \"I am doing this. Now I am doing that. Oh look, I am doing this and that guy is doing the exact same thing.\" And then there's the ultimate realization, \"Ah ha! That's me!\". That realization would make no sense if the individual has no sense of \"me\"! <\/p>\n\n<p>[speculation] On the other hand, perhaps it is too strict. It seems that it would unfairly favor social species, since it requires not only recognizing another member of the species (and being able to associate the anatomy of another member of the species with one's own anatomy), but it may also require the recognition of intent. That latter requirement is complicated by differentiating between intent and compulsion: at some point, one must realize that the being in the mirror isn't trying to copy but rather it always, inevitibly reflects one's motions. So, perhaps a cat is self-aware, in a sense that it has a constant story in its head of what it is doing and what it intends to do, but it cannot easily ascribe intent to other members of the species and thus cannot figure out that the cat in the mirror is automatically mirroring all of its movements. [/speculation] <\/p>\n\n<p>Herein lies the rub: there is no perfect test for self-awareness; we can cast doubt on any outcome. The best would be if these animals could communicate with us by language. In lieu of that, we have to think of such tests that demonstrate with reasonable confidence that the species carries all of the characteristics that we attribute to self-awareness. I think another good test would be determining whether the species can plan individual actions in the future; in order to say, \"first I will do this, then that; finally, that will allow me to do that\", it seems like it would reasonably require an understanding of self and the consequences of one's actions.

Many cats making this transition look in curiosity and awe and move on, never really caring that much about it -- much like kids.<\/p>\n\n<p>Bring a cat into a bathroom with a mirrored wall behind the sinks, when he's dealing with something where the mirror is in his line of sight.  Walk in behind.  When the cat turns around to look at you to play instantly, instead of trying to play with the mirror -- it recognizes that it shows whats behind him.  I have observed this.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a cat recognizing it's own tail out of it's \"perif\" is nothing special, neither is recognizing that it's him in the mirror.  He may not be cognitively advanced to think deeper than \"Yep, that's me, I have THIS look.  Oh, am I getting fat?\" -- they care less about that.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good test would be to have a cat with whom you can put something on his head and he doesn't care -- unless it's something he HATES by its LOOK.  Once you've established that over and over 100%, and have been able to put it on him without him caring without him SEEING it -- put him in front of the mirror and see if he tries to take it off.<\/p>\n\n<p>A red dot isn't going to do squat.  They don't give a shoot about things like that.  If you want to know whether they know IT'S THEM, put them in position where there's something they DON'T WANT on them -- and they try to get it off... where it's something they don't mind on them, they don't try to get it off after seeing themselves in the mirror.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not fool-proof, though.  They may not mind it on them because it's purely how it looks.  They can just walk away from the mirror and they don't have to worry about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>But back to the original point:  I don't think it's a big deal that they can recognize that it's themselves.

A mole-rat, no matter how intelligent, is unlikely to use a mirror for much of anything.  Using the same test for animals with very different sensory modalities is bound to fail. For example, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-_5XN6lIf0\" rel=\"nofollow\">the comments<\/a> of the following YouTube video.  The user Sluchesi notes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>sticking a piece of post-it paper on my tom cat's head where he couldn't see it without a mirror and while petting him, waited until I was sure he didn't notice it (he didn't respond to it), showed him the mirror and he instantly started trying to get the paper off his head (not the image in the mirror, his own), shaking it and using his paws.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>A second user (M. Ransom) did the same test and verified it.  Not quite to the level of scientific proof that you would want to see, but certainly worth a follow-up study by someone who focuses on the topic.  If true, it would indicate that cats probably do have a conception that the reflection in the mirror is them, but place little value on introspection or visual self-concepts.  This might indicate that what cats (and many other animals) lack is not the ability to have a model of self, but to have a model of some other being modeling yourself (i.e., 2nd-order model of self).  This is actually a quite complicated level of modeling: even humans are quite bad at guessing what other people think about them.  However, basically all humans try to do it, even if their guess is often mirror-bias (i.e., other people think about them like they think about themselves).  Given that this is nearly at the limit of average human cognition (3rd order models of other/self are rare and usually limited to strategic games like poker), it seems reasonable that most animals lack this ability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Having a model of another's conception of oneself is necessary for a being to care what they look like, for instance.  After all, if you can't comprehend that the world attaches importance to how you look, you would be unlikely to develop mechanisms to attach importance to it either.  In that second case, the mirror test may be accurate (i.e., it measures higher order thought), but it is in fact measuring something very different (and more advanced) than what it has been assumed to measure.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24408,"question_id":9297,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9297/is-recognizing-ones-own-mirror-reflection-a-valid-test-of-animal-intelligence-s","last_activity_date":1417329124,"creation_date":1373974366,"answer_count":3,"title":"Is recognizing one's own mirror reflection a valid test of animal intelligence/self awareness?","body":"<p>I've been looking at this <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/the_interspecies_internet_an_idea_in_progress.html\">Ted talk on interspecies internet<\/a>, and it appears that they have selected a small number of species of animals (dolphin, elephant, and some ape(?)) and are intent on developing interfaces for these animals to be able to connect with other animals over the internet. <\/p>\n\n<p>From the talk, it appeared as if one of the criteria for animal selection was whether or not an animal recognizes itself in the mirror.

Myelination is definitely a trait that has been acquired later in evolution, but \"the more the better\" does not apply. Imagine an electrical conductor - to insulate it a bit of plastic is enough. Adding more after that doesn't make a substantial difference. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) ...the order in which these receptors evolved...: myleine sheaths are made up of glial cells that wrap themselves around axons of neurons. Myeline makes neural transduction more efficient and faster. Hence, the amount of myelination tells you something about the efficiency and speed of transduction of the nerve (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206025231/pdf?md5=6d1b10008c625c0ef51f98480f72b9e2&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0960982206025231-main.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hartline (2007)<\/a>). For example, longer axons tend to be myelinated, short ones not. That, in turn, will have certain evolutionary benefits for the host, as more efficient communications means less energy required, lesser loss of information, and increased processing speeds. The amount of myelin hence tells you something about the importance of efficient communication of that sensory system. However, it does not tell you anything about when this receptor evolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, the relation between myelination and receptor evolution is remote at best. In terms of evolution, amounts of myelination may tell you something about the evolutionary pressure placed on faster and more efficient workings of the receptor systems.     <\/p>\n","answer_id":23566,"question_id":20647,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20647/what-can-myelination-tell-you-about-the-evolution-of-sensory-receptors","last_activity_date":1417220045,"creation_date":1408568130,"answer_count":1,"title":"What can myelination tell you about the evolution of sensory receptors?","body":"<p>I am reading Avi Chaudhuri's <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195433753.do\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Fundamentals of Sensory Perception\">Fundamentals of Sensory Perception<\/a> and wondering if the information given about the somatosensory system could tell us anything about the way it evolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems (at least naively) reasonable to assume that nerves became larger and more myelinated as time went on.

During this time it has gone from the most basic forms of life, simple self-replicating units, to the complex beings we see today. Evolution, the process of change within a collection of units, is caused by 4 factors, mutation, selection, drift, and gene flow. So firstly, the current state is not thought to just be the result of natural selection but instead a result of all the mechanisms of evolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Selection can itself be subdivided in to two types, natural and sexual selection. Therefore \"natural selection\" does not even contain all types of selection. Selection is not a simple process, but occurs in a very complex manner, simultaneously affecting the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005FOHQMG\">many levels upon which selection can act<\/a> (nucleotide, gene, organelle, cell, organs, organism, population, species, ecosystem etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of things to consider when discussing whether enough time has elapsed for the mechanisms of evolution to produce the variation we see today, a primary concern is quantifying how much variation there is in the world that has evolved. Here are <em>some<\/em> other factors which would determine the likelihood at arriving at that level of genetic variation:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mutation rates (per generation)<\/li>\n<li>Generation times<\/li>\n<li>Offspring per generation (affects the number of potentially new lineages per generation)<\/li>\n<li>Genome size (number of potential sites)<\/li>\n<li>Complexity and strength of selection<\/li>\n<li>Population size (affecting drift and the efficacy of selection)<\/li>\n<li>Genetic admixture/inbreeding/potential gene flow<\/li>\n<li>Recombination rates<\/li>\n<li>Social structure<\/li>\n<li>Environmental variation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These all vary wildly in contemporary populations and would also have varied in ancestral lineages too, this makes it, in my opinion, <strong>near impossible to even get a rough estimate of how likely our current state of variation evolved via the known mechanisms of evolution<\/strong>. But there is a simple answer, all variation you see today arose from simple life and evolved in the last 4 billion years via the four known mechanisms of evolution - which, in part, includes natural selection. The proof is in its existence and the absence of other possible (plausible) mechanisms.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>To illustrate the complexity of the problem and the high likelihood of these mechanisms leading to substantial genetic variation (this is highly unscientific):<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>I'd suggest a very conservative estimate of just mutation rates and time since life began (3.8 billion years, Last universal common ancestor [LUCA]), using approximate human mutation rates (<a href=\"http://www.genetics.org/content/156/1/297.abstract\">175 per generation<\/a> and 25 years per generation = 7 bp mutations per year), would suggest a single lineage from LUCA to now could have had some 26 billion mutations, an average of 8 mutations per site in the human genome (this would assume constant mutation and generation rates, and starting genome size of 3 billion BP in LUCA - obviously completely ridiculous, but it's just an illustration and assumes evolution purely by drift and mutation).<\/p>\n","answer_id":17285,"question_id":17265,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1399656947},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/719fddd0a3b34f044b28009316bcbe49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8112,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8112/aceofspades25","reputation":61,"display_name":"Aceofspades25"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1417077287,"creation_date":1417077287,"body":"<p>There was a paper that attempted to assess this published in 2010<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22454.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">There\u2019s plenty of time for evolution<\/a> - Herbert S.

Here is a larger section (found at <a href=\"http://books.google.se/books?id=_XitAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">google books<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Natural selection can also occur at the level of species, for certain characteristics enhance the rate of origin of new species or diminish the likelihood of species extinction. For instance, the number of species in lineages of herbivorous insects has generally increased faster than in closely related lineages that have other feeding habits. Neither gene selection nor species selection has molded the advantageous characteristics of individual organisms; rather, they have affected properties at the gene level or at the species level. But individual selection, selection among individual organisms within populations, is at the center of evolutionary theory. It is at this level that selection explains most of the adaptive features of organisms.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Going through this part-by-part; the first two sentences state that lineage/species selection can occur, in the sense that species traits can enhance the speciation rate of a lineage or decrease their risk of extinction, relative to other lineages (e.g. in herbivorous insects). <\/p>\n\n<p>He is then saying that the traits that are the target of this selection are not traits of individuals but traits/properties of the species/lineage. <\/p>\n\n<p>An example might help to explain the point. For instance, it has been argued that pelagic larvae in sessile ocean species will lead to higher dispersal rates, which means that species can colonize new environments, and this can lead to speciation through adaptive radiation (<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/507994\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jablonski &amp; Hunt. 2006. Larval Ecology, Geographic Range, and Species Survivorship in Cretaceous Mollusks: Organismic versus Species-Level Explanations. American Naturalist 168(4)\">Jablonski &amp; Hunt, 2006)<\/a>. A larger range will also correspond to lower extinction rates (everything else equal). The trait might also be fixed within a lineage (so there is no variance at the individual level within-species), and if so, this lineage as a whole could have higher speciation rates and lower extinction rates compared to a sister lineage that lacks pelagic larvae. <\/p>\n\n<p>The individuals within species will naturally have the underlying traits (pelagic larvae), but the traits that are selected at the lineage level (extinction risk &amp; speciation rate) are not properties of individuals but are traits of the lineage/species. <\/p>\n\n<p>He then ends by continuing with \"normal\" individual selection, and states that processes at this level is responsible for most adaptive features of organisms. It should also be noted that lineage selection is still considered controversial, and it has been shown that it is inherently much weaker than selection at the individual level. Personally, I think there are some very good examples of how species/lineage selection can function, but to what extent it is an important process for species and organisms is an open empirical question.

During this process, the external urinary sphincter is normally relaxed. The bladder neck and proximal portion of the urethra, which both contain abundant smooth muscle fibers, receive dual sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Besides the cholinergic and noradrenergic components, the principal mediators found in these nerve terminals are NPY, VIP, and NO.

Generally there are two completely different directions of thinking when talking about dangerous substances (this applies to dangerous chemicals as well): <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">linear no-threshold model<\/a> (LNT).<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">hormesis<\/a> model, in our case the model of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">radiation\nhormesis<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Summarizing the models the LNT model says that every dose has a negative response, so there is nothing like a stimulating dose and exposure should be avoided at any means. This reflects the policy in the handling of radioactive substances. If you look at the figure below, the curves a + b (supra-linear and linear) reflect the LNT model (the figure comes from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BpvNM.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The radiation hormesis model says that there is a dose range in which the radiation above the background level is not only not harmful, but beneficial. High doses are (in line with the LNT model) also considered harmful. This can be seen in the curves c (linear-quadratic) and d (hormesis) in the figure above. The benefits are thought to take place through the activation of repair mechanisms (which are only activated by radiation) which protect against changes in the genome and thus also protect, once activated, against changes which are caused by other agents and reasons. See reference 1 for more details about radiation hormesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of studies which observe this effects in the laboratory and this is also one of the major critic points: To my knowledge it is currently unknown if these effects can also be seen outside a controlled laboratory environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>Other critique points are low study publications (which makes studies prone to statistical errors), using wrong models (cell culture) or too high doses. See references 2 and 3.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since our environment contains naturally radioactive substances as well as cosmic and UV radiation, we have developed pretty efficient mechanisms to deal with these problem. Additionally measurable effect of radiation on the activity repair mechanisms can be seen (and this is not debated at all), but the main question is if these effects can also have a beneficial effect. It is also not known, if all radiation ($\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$) have the same effect, or if some of these like $\\alpha$-radiation is more dangerous. <\/p>\n\n<p>So I think it may be possible that there is some positive effect, but until this is proven, I would rather be safe than sorry.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://radiationhormesis.com/RadiationHormesis/Evidence%20for%20beneficial%20low%20level%20radiation%20effects%20and%20radiation%20hormesis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evidence for beneficial low level radiation effects and radiation\nhormesis.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/0952-4746/30/2/E02/pdf/0952-4746_30_2_E02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncertainties in studies of low statistical power<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://download.nap.edu/login.php?record_id=11340&amp;page=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nap.edu%2Fdownload.php%3Frecord_id%3D11340\" rel=\"nofollow\">Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":24278,"question_id":24203,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/503240e27f4fdf4223c6c8166d91dd3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":10270,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10270/unzipped-genes","reputation":41,"display_name":"Unzipped Genes"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1416888320,"creation_date":1416888320,"body":"<p>I would be inclined to say yes based on the current wording of your question.

So in short, each line represents the distribution of allele frequencies in different hypothetical populations, that all started with the allele frequencey p=0.5. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for your specific questions, as the comment from @remi.b says, t is expressed as <strong>generation time<\/strong> since this is the relevant time scale for evolutionary changes. The reason why it is a <strong>function of population size<\/strong>, N, is that genetic drift acts more stongly in small populations, since it is essentially a sampling effect. You can see it as a repeated application of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">binomial sampling<\/a>. So in small populations different populations will quicky drift away from the starting point of p=0.5, while this takes a longer time in larger populations.

His results show that heterozygozity decreases at the rate of $1/(2N)$ per generation, and after 2N generations the distribution of allele frequencies is essentially flat (if you started at p=0.5). The degree of heterozygocity at time t is given by:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$H_t = H_0*e^{-(\\frac{1}{2N})t}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>However, your graph does not show populations where fixation has occured (only heterozygous populations), and this proportion will increase over time in the absence of new mutations. So what is missing are bars at 0 and 1, and these will become higher as time goes by (more populations will have become fixed for one of the alleles). It should also be mentioned that these results deal with the effective population size, so $N$ is really equal to $N_e$.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the confusion of <strong>frequency/frequencies<\/strong>; the graph shows the frequency of one allele in different populations (so the <em>allele frequency<\/em> on the x-axis), but each line shows the distribution of <em>allele frequencies<\/em> in different populations.

These are coupled to different pathways and are recognized by different T cell populations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The MHCI molecule presents all proteins which are present in the cell on the surface. To do so, peptides coming from the proteasome (where long proteins are digested) are transported in the the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by a special transporter called Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). By doing so, a profile of all proteins expressed in the cell is presented on its surface, including proteins which arise due to an infection of the cell. MHCI is recognized by cytotoxic (or CD8 positive) T cells which subsequently kill all cells which show foreign antigens on their surface (since this is a sign for an infection).<\/p>\n\n<p>The MHCII complex only presents proteins on its surface which have been taken up by phagocytosis (so here only external proteins are presented). To prevent binding of cellular proteins in the ER (like for MHCI), the binding pocket of the receptor is blocked by the invariant chain. This chain dissociates only when the MHCII complex enter the phagolysosome with its acidic conditions. This makes sure that only proteins which have been taken up by phagocytosis are presented. MHCII complexes are recognized by helper (or CD4 positive) T cells, which in turn can activate B cells to raise a proper immune response.<\/p>\n\n<p>In theory this should prevent all problems. In the practical life this is different for dendritic cells in a mechanism called \"cross presentation\". In this mechanism antigens which are taken up by phagocytosis are exported from the phagolysosme and imported into the ER. This pathway also involves the TAP protein. By choosing this way, APC can activate naive CTL which will kill all cells which present this antigen.

I need to make at least 10ug of RNA:DNA, which is 20 times the suggested limit for poly A RNA, so a direct scale up probably isn't practical. <\/p>\n\n<p>I can't find a literature precedent for making such large amounts of DNA through reverse transcription, everything I have found that uses RNA:DNA duplexes used short strands that were chemically synthesized and combined, my mRNA is 1800 bases long, so I can't just order an oligo, I have to make it.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT : I can't comment on my own question.<\/p>\n\n<p>The duplexes will be about 1800 bases long, it's for firefly luciferase.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trying to make the DNA for the duplex from the original DNA template presents other issues. While it would be easy to cut it out from the plasmid, it would be double stranded, and I would have to mix with the RNA and heat it up to dissociate everything and hope that the RNA bound before the DNA strands reassociated. I also think it would complicate my controls, because it would be harder to say that any expression I see after delivering these duplexes came from the RNA and not the DNA. Of course synthesizing the DNA from the RNA could also introduce that problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some crude calculations suggests that the dNTPs are the limiting reagent for a transcript this size, and that even with 5ug of mRNA I should have enough oligo dT primer for the reaction. I right now I am running reactions from 0.5 to 5ug of mRNA, 1uL of primer, and 4uL of dNTPs, to make sure I have enough. Hopefully the gel will turn out ok.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I got the results. So far it looks like 3.0ug of mRNA works the best. It has the darkest band, and looks like the right length. Less mRNA gives fainter bands that appear too short, and more mRNA gives slightly fainter bands that appear slightly too short. Also, I ran the reaction for 2 hours instead of 1.<\/p>\n","question_id":11078,"tags":["molecular-biology","mrna","reverse-transcription"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":24274,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":107,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1382973935},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7LxPC.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":561,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/561/becko","reputation":503,"display_name":"becko","accept_rate":43},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":1,"post_id":21326,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410819215,"comment_id":33512,"body":"Can you provide a link or two to the type of metabolic map design / layout you prefer?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7LxPC.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":561,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/561/becko","reputation":503,"display_name":"becko","accept_rate":43},"score":0,"post_id":21326,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1410872877,"comment_id":33545,"body":"@MikeTaylor Added a picture to the question."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":21326,"edited":false,"creation_date":1410898581,"comment_id":33607,"body":"Have you looked into papers from systems biology groups which publish these networks reconstructions?

It is even relatively meaningless to compare e.g. taxonomic families between taxonomic orders, since they are used in such different ways, and compared to ranks below the species level taxonomic 'order' and 'family' have much clearer definitions.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you with breeds of dogs are referring to distict phenotypes (which is basically what they are), you can easily see that some human populations also have distict phenotypes, so in this sense they are similar. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason why the concept of human races is largely obsolete and controversial (along with breeds) is clearly our human collective history of racism, nazism and eugenics.<\/p>\n","answer_id":24210,"question_id":24208,"up_vote_count":8}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/24208/like-other-animals-why-humans-dont-have-species-breeds","last_activity_date":1416742351,"creation_date":1416561666,"answer_count":1,"title":"Like other animals, why humans don't have species & breeds?","body":"<p>Like other animals, why don't humans have species &amp; breeds ?\n<br/> Even my pet dog is one type of breed, but we (humans) lack breeds &amp; species?
