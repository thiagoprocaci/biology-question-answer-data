They invented a multilumen catheter with a thermal resistor on the end (a Swan Ganz catheter) which could be advanced into the pulmonary artery. Through another lumen, a cold saline solution of known temperature and volume is injected into the right atrium. Using a computer model, the temperature of the blood at the catheter tip is used to determine stroke volume.

The blood temperature is measured by a thermistor at the catheter tip, which lies within the pulmonary artery, and a computer is used to acquire the thermodilution profile; that is, the computer quantifies the change in blood temperature as it flows over the thermistor surface. The cardiac output computer then calculates flow (cardiac output from the right ventricle) using the blood temperature information, and the temperature and volume of the injectate.

Or it might be a result of sequencing errors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, depending on how you assign a taxonomy to the sequence, there might be cases where there are so many different possibilities for where this sequence came from (because it is very conserved in a lot of different organisms, even from different domains of life), that this sequence will not get any taxonomy assigned. Not because there is none, but because we cannot safely decide which it is.\nSome people also speak of this information as \"dark matter\".\nThere is for example <a href=\"http://microbialdarkmatter.org\">this project<\/a> which specifically is designed to study the dark matter we can (or at least for some reason do) assign to be microbes, but not more specifically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, any decision of where to place potential dark matter sequence is guided by our previous knowledge about the domains of life and the genomes of all those organisms. This knowledge is very incomplete. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am sorry this answer lacks some more nice sources. Most of the information is based on my knowledge as a person working with datasets that might include \"dark matter\", if I would call it that. (I call it \"not assigned sequence\".) I don't have the time right now to add more sources, but if needed I can maybe add some later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nAs a fast add-on after re-reading your question: How much of the sequence is unassigned for example if one would study your gut depends a lot on what is actually there in you gut that we know, how diverse the community in your gut is, what database is used for comparison and how old this database is, how the data is preprocessed and analysed, and so much more. But yes, there is still a lot of genomic information in nature that has not made it into any database.<\/p>\n","answer_id":29657,"question_id":29642,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1424248702}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29642/what-is-biological-dark-matter","last_activity_date":1424248702,"creation_date":1424198666,"answer_count":2,"title":"What is biological dark matter?","body":"<p>I recently stumbled upon the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dark_matter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biological Dark Matter<\/a> wiki page.

The fovea has maximal visual acuity (high resolution) and a high density of cones, which are specialized photoreceptors to sense colors. However, cones are not very sensitive to light.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture showing the foveal field of view:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xcRLD.jpg\" alt=\"foveal view\"><br>\n<sup><strong>Source<\/strong>: <a href=\"http://cleareyesight-batesmethod.info/id114.html\">Pinhole Eyeglasses<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p>If you look at the same object using peripheral vision, the image is formed more eccentrically on the retina. Here, cones are sparse, but high densities of rods are present. Rods do not detect color, but are much more sensitive to light than cones. In fact, they can faithfully detect a single photon! (<a href=\"http://webvision.umh.es/webvision/Evolution.%20PART%20III.html\">Webvision<\/a>) Moreover, many rods converge onto a single ganglion cell, and rod responses are therefore summated.

Although the overall pattern of transport in the phloem can be stated simply as source-to-sink movement, the specific pathways involved are often more complex. Not all sources supply all sinks on a plant; rather, certain sources preferentially supply specific sinks. In the case of herbaceous plants, such as sugar beet and soybean, the following generalizations can be made.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Proximity<\/strong>. The proximity of the source to the sink is a significant factor. The upper mature leaves on a plant usually provide photosynthetic to the growing shoot tip and young, immature leaves; the lower leaves supply predominantly the root system. Intermediate leaves export in both directions, bypassing the intervening mature leaves.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Development<\/strong>. The importance of various sinks may shift during plant development. Whereas the root and shoot\napices are usually the major sinks during vegetative growth, fruits generally become the dominant sinks during\nreproductive development, particularly for adjacent and other nearby leaves.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vascular connections<\/strong>. Source leaves preferentially supply sinks with which they have direct vascular connections. In the shoot system, for example, a given leaf is generally connected via the vascular system to other leaves directly above or below it on the stem. Such a vertical row of leaves is called an orthostichy. The number of internodes between leaves on the same orthostichy varies with the species.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Modification of translocation pathways<\/strong>. Interference with a translocation pathway by wounding or pruning can alter the patterns established by proximity and vascular connections that have been outlined here. In the absence of direct connections between source and sink, vascular interconnections, called anastomoses (singular anastomosis), can provide an alternative pathway. In sugar beet, for example, removing source leaves from one side of the plant can bring about cross-transfer of photosynthetic to young leaves (sink leaves) on the pruned side. Removal of the lower source leaves on a plant can force the upper source leaves to translocate materials to the roots, and removal of the upper source leaves can force lower source leaves to translocate materials to the upper parts of the plant.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":29636,"question_id":29635,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29635/do-all-sources-supply-all-sinks-on-a-plant","last_activity_date":1424186885,"creation_date":1424184591,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do all sources supply all sinks on a plant?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Sources include any exporting organs, typically mature leaves, that\n  are capable of producing photosynthete in excess of their own needs.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Sinks include any nonphotosynthetic organs of the plant and organs\n  that do not produce enough photosynthetic products to support their\n  own growth or storage needs.

In the 1960's White and colleagues <strong>transplanted canine brains<\/strong> from one animal to another (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5844085\" rel=\"nofollow\">White et al., 1965<\/a>). In total 6 brains were transplanted. However, the recipients' brains were not removed and the <strong>brains were merely surgically transplanted into the neck region of the recipient animal<\/strong>, and connected to the recipient's cervical vasculature (carotide arteries and jugular vein). Hence, the recipient canines ended up with <strong>two brains<\/strong>. The authors, however showed with these experiments that the transplantation of brains was feasible, and that the transplants survived and remained functional, which was evidenced by EEG activity. The brains survived from 6 hours up to two days.<\/p>\n\n<p>Later, White and colleagues worked out a way to keep an <strong>isolated<\/strong> (but blood-perfused) monkey <strong>brain alive outside the skull<\/strong>, potentially allowing for a primate brain to be transplanted (<a href=\"http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/0300-9572%2875%2990043-X/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">White et al, 1975<\/a>). The procedure could include longer-term 'storage' of the brain by cooling it, making the possibility of transplantation more feasible. However, White realized the difficulties with this approach, since, and I quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] by definition the brain must be isolated before the transplantation, and thus requiring all nervous tissue connections to be severed (e.g. cranial nerves and spinal cord), the isolated transplanted monkey brain is without a mechanism to receive or transmit information. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To address this issue White et al. set out to <strong>transfer  the entire cephalon<\/strong> (head) of a monkey to the body of a recipient whose own cephalon had been removed at a mid-cervical\nlevel. Under these circumstances the brain, being within its own cephalon, still connects to the cranial nerves:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vFJZ9.png\" alt=\"CranialNerves\"><br>\n<sup><a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/cranial.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">source: University of washington<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>White et al. succeeded in transplanting a head, but the preparation rarely survived longer than three days<\/strong> due to haemorrhagic shock (<a href=\"http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/0300-9572%2875%2990043-X/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">White et al, 1975<\/a>). Basically the recipient was quadriplegic, as the face was fully functional and White comments, and I quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Observe the wakeful appearance of the cephalon and the obvious movement of the facial musculature with open mouth and eyes. This preparation gives every evidence of being in intelligent contact with its environment. [...] Cortical [EEG] activity in this preparation demonstrates awake recordings.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, with the current available technology it <strong>does not make much sense to perform a brain transplant, as the transplanted brain cannot be functionally (neurally) connected to recipient body<\/strong>. However, strides are being made in re-connecting a severed spinal cord (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821155/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canavero, 2013<\/a>), endeavors that could bring head transplants a little closer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quadriplegic people obviously face extreme psychological challenges (<a href=\"http://www.sane.org/information/factsheets-podcasts/848-staying-mentally-healthy-when-you-have-a-spinal-cord-injury\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sane Australia)<\/a>. However, even when they have become quadriplegic due to an event later in life, they are not mentally changed, in that they are still 'themselves'. Therefore, although human transplants never have been done, I dare to say that the transplanted head will determine the psychological 'self' of the recipient body, which includes memory and personal traits.

The color of distant objects are also shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (e.g., distant mountains).<\/strong> Some painters, notably Cézanne, employ \"warm\" pigments (red, yellow and orange) to bring features forward towards the viewer, and \"cool\" ones (blue, violet, and blue-green) to indicate the part of a form that curves away from the picture plane.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JgT9f.jpg\" alt=\"Manet's &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The above is Manet's \"Luncheon on the Grass\" - and if you look at it briefly it seems the bathing woman is sort of hovering amidst the trio instead of rinsing herself off in the background.

The daytime sky has numerous reference points - the horizon, mountains, clouds, airplanes, nearby buildings, etc. I would bet the reference points are the number one reason you perceive the daytime sky to be closer, as our brain is constantly taking them into account without us thinking about it. There are other cues, too: The daytime sky has a gradient to it - that is, the blue of the sky differs due to the curve of the atmosphere, and gradients increase depth perception with more saturated colors being perceived as closer (as opposed to the edges of the daytime sky, which are often less saturated). <\/p>\n\n<p>The night sky, on the other hand, is pretty much solid black (<em>if you live in suburban or urban areas<\/em>).

My own attempt at a bottle garden is failing and I'm looking to \"debug\" what's going on. <\/p>\n\n<p>My garden is a 2 litre glass jar filled with gravel, sand and soil, filling about a quarter of the jar. The soil is rather damp. I'm observing the following: When the bottle is sealed, plants such as moss, strawberry shoots and seeds thrive for a couple of weeks. They will then wilt and worms that had hitched a ride in the soil try to escape. When opening the bottle, there is a strong smell exactly like manure. The brief exchange of air when opening the bottle is enough to allow the plants to properly rot over the coming days, with mold only now spreading. (This proves that oxygen was depleted before I opened the jar) I removed the dead plants, sprinkled seeds on the soil and closed the jar. The seeds germinated and thrived for a couple of weeks until the process repeated.<\/p>\n\n<p>At first look, it appears that when oxygen has been depleted, anaerobic bacteria take over, producing H2S, which I assume kill the plants. Or are they killed by changes in pH under high CO2 concentrations? Why does this not occur for all bottle gardens? Is the problem that there's too few plants to keep up the oxygen level which keeps the anaerobic bacteria at bay, is it the waterlogged soil or some other factor I'm unaware of?<\/p>\n\n<p><br><br>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Sfrq.jpg\" alt=\"Latimer&#39;s highly successful bottle garden\">\n<br>Latimer did something right with his bottle garden, which started with a seedling and some compost. <\/p>\n","question_id":28502,"tags":["bacteriology","plant-physiology","ecosystem","anaerobic-respiration"],"score":14,"accepted_answer_id":28609,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":304,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1423736022},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cad89a877102a31fd4642bfd88e3e9a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10304,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10304/tim","reputation":183,"display_name":"Tim"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001738197266/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":13187,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13187/watercleave","reputation":405,"display_name":"Watercleave"},"score":0,"post_id":28606,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424109092,"comment_id":47164,"body":"It seems unlikely purely in terms of the amount of air which comes into contact with the nasal epithelium - the tissue which contains olfactory receptors."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"post_id":28606,"edited":false,"creation_date":1424109968,"comment_id":47166,"body":"Nose doesn&#39;t really absorb it.

I am no mathematician (let alone physicist, both of whom could answer this more accurately) but here is my reasoning (faulty though it may be).<\/p>\n\n<p>You are assuming that someone would pass out from lack of blood supply to the brain.  Given we have absolutely no problems normally at 1 g (the force of gravity on earth), the average non-couch-potato person can tolerate forces of up to 20 G for less than 10 seconds, to 10 G for 1 minute, and 6 G for 10 minutes before passing out. <\/p>\n\n<p>But g is very dependent on (as you stated) distance from center. It's also very dependent on revolutions per minute.<\/p>\n\n<p>$$g=\\frac{R\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\times rpm}{30}\\right)^2}{9.81}$$ \nor \n$$R=\\frac{9.81 g}{\\left(\\pi\\times rpm\\over30 \\right)^2}$$<\/p>\n\n<p>g = Decimal fraction of Earth gravity<br>\nR = Radius from center of rotation in <em>meters<\/em><br>\nπ = 3.14159<br>\nrpm = revolutions per minute<\/p>\n\n<p>The average North American male is 1.75m tall. That means the distance of the top of the head and bottom of the feet (if stretched out at full length) from center is under a meter (<strong>.875m<\/strong>). At <strong>60 rpm's<\/strong> (that's pretty fast), solving for the above, <strong>g = 3.52<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>g = [.875({3.14159x60}/30)^2]/9.81 = 3.521 (so just over 3.5G)<\/p>\n\n<p>Gravity at the top of the head and the bottom of the feet would be 3.5G, while the gravity at the center would be zero G. The heart can easily compensate for that for a while. An astronaut, trained for increased Gs, can do well for longer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Much worse than too little blood to the head is <em>too much<\/em>, which is what I would be worried about. Eventually, slightly less than half the blood volume would end up below the waist with the feet feeling the most pressure, and the rest above, with the brain being engorged with blood, which can cause hemorrhage (not taking into account here precise fluid physics). I'm not sure how this would play out in space over longer periods of time, but survival would be the norm for the scenes we see in <em>Gravity<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>An Air Force physician named John Stapp was the first to determine just what humans could take in the way of G forces. On his final run, firing nine solid-fuel rockets, his \"sled\" accelerated to 632 miles per hour in five seconds, slamming him into two tons of wind pressure, then came to a stop in just over one second. A witness said it was \"absolutely inconceivable anybody could go that fast, then just stop, and survive.\" But Stapp did\u2014in fact, he went on to live another 45 years, dying quietly at home in 1999 at the age of 89\u2014and he experienced a record-breaking <strong>46.2 G's<\/strong>.

The eye regulates the amount of entering light by contracting or expanding the pupil. At night, your pupils will accordingly enlarge to extract more light from their surroundings. However, this dilation also leaves your eyes unprepared for the sudden burst of light from a camera flash.<\/p>\n\n<p>When light from the flash enters your eyes under these conditions, <strong>your pupils are unable to contract fast enough<\/strong> (full constriction takes a few seconds) to prevent the <strong>light from reflecting back<\/strong>, off of the red blood vessels <strong>of the <em>choroid<\/em><\/strong>. The choroid plexus nourishes the retina, and therefore contains ample blood supply. As a result, the camera will pick up the red reflection, resulting in the red-eye effect. Interestingly, due to their increased \u201cdark adaptation,\u201d children more commonly have red eyes in photographs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The amount of melanin, a light-absorbing pigment in the eye, also has a role in the red-eye effect. Individuals with <strong>lower levels of melanin<\/strong> will absorb less and thus <strong>reflect more light<\/strong>, explaining the high incidence of the red-eye effect in albinos.<\/p>\n\n<p>Though the cause of this effect is wired in the biology of the eye, some cameras can reduce red-eye by sending a few preliminary flashes before the final flash to give the <strong>pupils enough time to contract<\/strong> and adapt to the increased-light conditions. Another way to reduce the effect is to avoid looking directly into the camera lens, which will reduce the reflection of light. Finally, if all else fails, modern image editing software, such as Photoshop, can remove the red discoloration.<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to why dogs and other animals may not have red-eyes but other colors, this was indeed answered in your <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27621/why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo\">linked question<\/a>: some animal species have a <strong><em>tapetum lucidum<\/em>, which is situated in front of the choroid and reflects light back<\/strong> onto the retina thereby increasing light sensitivity.

With carbohydrates they would need more than the double amount of stored carbohydrates to get the same energy. Proteins are approximately on the same level as carbohydrates.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you look on this problem not by energy per mass but volume per mass, fat still wins. For this we need the density of protein (muscles in this case) and fat. Paper 1 (see reference below) say that the human muscles have an average density of 1.06g/cm³. Paper 2 lists a density of 0.92g/cm³ for fat. So fats (this is practically only valid for the human body, but should be in the same range for other animals) are about 15% less dense than muscles. As the energy density per weight is about double as high for fat, this compensates for the lower density.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carbohydrates are better, but are still not as good as fat. It's a bit hard to find specific densities for carbohydrates in the human body, so let's use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glycogen<\/a> (which is a widely found carbohydrate used for mid-term storage of energy) for this purpose. Paper 3 lists a density for Glycogen between 1.40\u20131.62 g/cm³, so fat has only 55-65% of it's density. Since the energy density of fat is about 2.25x that of carbohydrates, fat is still better.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATP<\/a> in comparison, it has relatively little energy to provide. ATP delivers about 32.3 kJ/mole (with 507.18 g/mole this make around 64 J/gram) per phosphate released from the molecule, which is 128 J/gram if both phosphates are released. This is approximately 300x less energy per gram than fat. This makes sense, since fats are completely oxidized (down to water and carbon dioxide), while in ATP only the phosphate bonds are broken.

So <strong>Chris Stronks is correct<\/strong> in telling the heat flux is <strong>perceived<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Mechanism of feeling cold:<\/h2>\n\n<p>When you touch a cold object the heat is lost through conduction and radiation through the portion of skin that is in contact with the object. The cold will cause vasoconstriction of that part of skin - This means that the temperature of that part of skin rapidly equilibriates with that of the object. As there is rapid cooling (assuming that the object is cold) the rate of firing of the warmth receptors decrease and the rate of firing of the cold receptors increase. This allows the brain to interpret that the skin is losing heat (the flux).<\/p>\n\n<p>The radiation part of heat loss is more appreciated when you pass a uncurtained window during the winter - the temperature difference is so great that very high loss of heat occurs through radiation that you shiver. You have to note that during these instances there is no decrease in the core body temperature. The actual decrease in core body heat needs a long exposure to such conditions. In the scenarios detailed above the heat loss is primarily from skin which reflects the ambient conditions (very quickly). Thus the peripheral receptors effect <strong>Anticipatory Control<\/strong> which is effectively measuring the flux of heat through skin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The opposite occurs when you suddenly stand beneath the sun coming from a cold room - the radiant temperature of the sun being so great will cause the skin temperature to rapidly rise causing the body to feel very hot (though the core body temperature has not changed much).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Interesting details that may increase your understanding (though not directly related to the question):<\/h2>\n\n<p>The heat control effected through sensing the change in the skin temperature is called <strong>Anticipatory Control<\/strong>. In this the brain \"anticipates\" what is going to happen - for example a sudden cold draught - and will respond to it - reponds by increasing the heat production (shivering).<\/p>\n\n<p>The heat control effected through sensing the core body temperature is <strong>Negative Feedback Control<\/strong>. In this the brain <strong>responds<\/strong> to increase in the core body temperature and takes steps to remedy this (the response will bring the temperature back to the set point).<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>For more see:Boron &amp; Boulpaep Textbook of Medical Physiology, 2nd Edition, Chapter 59.<\/sup><\/p>\n","answer_id":28522,"question_id":28520,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1423757899},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78f38914e0d07733567672a47c53904b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8015,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8015/hav0k","reputation":1090,"display_name":"Hav0k"},"score":0,"post_id":28527,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423734540,"comment_id":46918,"body":"I&#39;ve got two examples that I can&#39;t really bring in line with that: First, why then do we feel such a difference between, for example, 10&#176;C cold water and air?

Also see <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21258/how-does-temperature-influence-the-rate-of-protein-degradation/24218#24218\">this<\/a> post. <\/p>\n\n<p>So while temperature sensing is absolutely necessary even for cold-blooded animals, plants and other organisms, there is no mechanism to measure heat flux. You can just measure the effect of heat not the flow of heat. For e.g. you cannot say if a body is cooling more rapidly than the other just by perceiving it for a short duration. It is possible to consciously calculate heat flux but it is neither measured nor (afaik) is fed in as a parameter to any control systems that regulate body temperature.<\/p>\n","answer_id":28527,"question_id":28520,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1423833596},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":6,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":28530,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423745461,"comment_id":46936,"body":"&quot;I say yes, heat-flux is definitely sensed as it per definition generates a temperature difference.&quot; I disagree with this statement.

In other words, after being exposed for a while to a certain temperature, one looses the perception of temperature <em>per se<\/em> (assuming temperatures are within comfortable limits of course, otherwise general discomfort will arise such as shivering or sweating etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, temperature sensing in humans <strong>is not absolute, but differential<\/strong>, and occurs when differences occur relative to the baseline.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03212769#page-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Holmes and Wood (1968)<\/a> mention in their Introduction the following, and I quote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...three variables of thermal stimulation [...] affect the sensitivity of human subjects to warm and cool stimuli. These are (1) the temperature to which the skin has been adapted, (2) the area of skin over which the thermal energy is applied, and (3) the rate at which the temperature of the skin is changed.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Variables (1) and (3) clearly emphasize the differential nature of temperature perception in humans. Variable (2) is a general psychophysical phenomenon, and basically shows that when a stimulus is sufficiently large, temperature differences will be more easily felt, while when the skin surface being stimulated is excessively small (say a needle with a small temperature difference is pressed against the skin) certain temperature differences may not be felt any longer.<\/p>\n\n<p>With regard to your question on metal and whether heat-flux can be sensed: a metal surface will feel cool only when it is lower in temperature than your body. Suppose now you touch a metal object at room temperature, i.e. lower than your body temperature. In that case, as you already indicate, it will draw away heat quickly from your skin by conduction, creating a 'heat-flux' if you like. The extraction of heat thereby elicits a powerful stimulus, because a large temperature difference creeps into your skin as heat is drawn away from your skin and underlying tissues. As such, and contrary to other answers given elsewhere, I explicitly say <strong>yes, 'heat-flux' can be sensed<\/strong> as it <em>per definition<\/em> generates a <strong>temperature difference<\/strong>. This in contrast to touching insulators like wood or plastic, which will quickly adopt the temperature of the skin very locally where you touch it. However, as has been pointed out by others - this <strong>does not mean<\/strong> that temperature is measured by <strong>heat-flux sensors <em>per se<\/em><\/strong>. In contrast, temperature is measured by temperature sensors that detect temperature differences (<em>differential stimuli<\/em>) between skin and external media. Because a temperature change is also a differential stimulus, it will also be detected, and hence 'heat-flux' will therefore be detected as well.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/sup><br>\n<sup><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03212769#page-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Holmes &amp; Wood, <em>Perception &amp; Psychophysics<\/em> 1968; <strong>3<\/strong>:81-4<\/a><\/sup>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":28530,"question_id":28520,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1423833839}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28520/do-humans-perceive-temperature-or-heat-flux-or-both","last_activity_date":1423833839,"creation_date":1423701051,"answer_count":3,"title":"Do humans perceive temperature or heat-flux?

The three biggest reasons for selecting these genes are 1) their ubiquity; 2) the presence of many copies per cell, so it's easier to PCR amplify the sequences; and 3) mitochondrial and plastid DNA has a much higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA, making it possible to uniquely barcode very closely related organisms. This method is incredibly sensitive, reliable, and easy. The original DNA barcoding publication can be found at <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1512/313\" rel=\"nofollow\">doi: 10.1098/rspb.2002.2218<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of consortia like <a href=\"http://www.barcodeoflife.org/content/about/what-cbol\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBOL<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.boldsystems.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOLD<\/a> and <a href=\"http://ibol.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iBOL<\/a>, there are now many millions of reference sequences databased, covering pretty much any multicellular organism you are ever likely to encounter (assuming you don't work on a deep-seq sub or something).<\/p>\n\n<p>As you say in your post, there are significant limitations to using qPCR to identify species.

The method is very fast, and in cases where you are only interested in detecting a single species or small number of species, it's much more convenient than getting the DNA sequenced (for example, during quality control in a meat processing plant, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02652030701584041\" rel=\"nofollow\">doi: 10.1080/02652030701584041<\/a>).<\/p>\n","answer_id":28541,"question_id":28535,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1423805791,"creation_date":1423805791,"body":"<p>DNA Barcoding is a method or a protocol which, as you have already mentioned, uses genetic markers to identify species.

At first we thought it was a piece of lint, but then it suddenly <em>moved<\/em>. I picked it up in a paper towel, and put it in one of my mother's eye cream containers, which it is currently in. I believe this means that it is pretty strong, since it appeared to have pulled itself all the way up from the floor, to the top of the bed, then across to the other side of a King-sized mattress. <\/p>\n\n<p>It appears to be a worm wrapped in a cocoon. It is pretty short, being small enough to fit inside an eye cream container.<\/p>\n\n<p>The creature is a pale yellow-white/cream, with brownish-red tips on each end (unless it can somehow turn around without exiting its casing). It looks from the side as if it has a rather flat face, one that comes to a slight bump at the bottom, but is pretty much flat. The casing is light grey, with some small portions that appear to be almost the same color as the organism, just slightly darker. There is an opening at each end of the casing, which the organism uses to slide slightly out. It has never fully come out of the casing. The edges of the openings at each end are white. The casing seems to either be made out of or covered in dust.<\/p>\n\n<p>It can create a substance that is sticky and strong enough to support its weight. I cannot tell if the substance is created by the 'worm', or the 'cocoon'. A thread at each end of the casing is connected to the side of the container by the substance. When I accidentally detached one end of the casing, the entire thing began to shake violently when held so that one end was hanging. It wouldn't stop until I had turned it so that both ends were touching the side of the container. Within minutes, though, it had reattached the broken end. <em>Minutes<\/em>. Not hours, but <em>one minute<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The holes at each end of the cocoon can either grow or shrink closed. I believe this allows us to tell which opening is in use. If it is nearly shut, it will come out the other end.<\/p>\n\n<p>It appears to be nocturnal, since it doesn't move during the day, but it is very active at night. It also appears to react to light. If some is put on it, it will poke out to look around.  <\/p>\n\n<p>It has survived for four days straight without food, as far as we know. We put a small piece of lettuce in with it. However, there are two small, brownish things on the bottom of the container. This may be its excrement.<\/p>\n\n<p>The creature moves by reaching out with its 'tentacle/worm', grabbing onto something (including the ground), and pulling itself forward.<\/p>\n\n<p>I cannot tell if the creature is attaching to the container's side to climb, or because it is morphing. If that is the case, then the outer shell may be a cocoon. It did detach itself from the side of the container, and first hid under a ledge of lettuce, but now has wrapped itself in lettuce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for helping me figure out what this thing is. I haven't ever seen anything like it, and it may be interesting to keep alive and study/watch.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize: can someone please help me identify this creature?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eXbpL.jpg\" alt=\"Creature\"><\/p>\n","question_id":28479,"tags":["species-identification"],"score":14,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":365,"up_vote_count":14,"last_edit_date":1423587679},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6e8cc1cfea0efb8c5c77445bc064298?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":13407,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13407/warrenu","reputation":26,"display_name":"WarrenU"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":6,"post_id":28484,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423597444,"comment_id":46795,"body":"The drone bee is haploid, they only have 1 copy of each chromosome, so the chromosomes aren&#39;t duplicated.

In order to make that conclusion you need to run your samples twice (on two separate membranes) and do a 1:1 and 2:1 ECL and if you observed such a difference then you are on firmer grounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect what has happened in the above experiment is that you have done a 1:1 (with 1Ab and 2Ab not distributed equally on the membrane) then after perhaps not a very thorough wash, you have done another 1Ab and 2Ab incubation using the a 2:1 mix. I suspect what has happened is that in your 1:1 the left hand side has not received the Ab mixtures very well and when you did the 2:1 since the right hand still Ab attached to it (if you didn't strip the membrane) so the left hand side was \"forced\" to get the Abs hence again the Ab mixture and ECL not equally bound. It is obvious since one image is opposite the other so its the Ab incubation step that has gone wrong. Otherwise if you have done the second ECL incubation mixture straight after the first and didn't do a wash step, the same can result if the membrane did not receive the initial ECL mixture equally since you can get a blocking effect by the old ECL mixture and perhaps what has happened is that the H2O2 or the substrate was present in excess in the second incubation step hence amplifying the signal in the sections of the membrane that did not receive the ECL mixture very well in the first place, relative to the rest of the membrane, which still has ECL liquid on it from the last experiment (again if you haven't washed the membrane well as ECL can be active for up to 24 hours in some kits but after a few hours the activity usually reduces but can still be observed)<\/p>\n\n<p>What you need to do is after ECL, wash the membrane with TBST for a few minutes followed by TBS, leave the membrane in the sun to dry so that the Ab slowly denature (although that doesn't always happen specially with high affinity Abs such as anti-tubulin and actin). After at least 24 hours, strip the membrane from Ab and redo the Ab incubation. The best thing to do is to do all the incubation steps in a sealed bag then make sure the membrane receives the ECL mixture equally and do the visualisation. I would say however since the membrane is unequally \"contaminated\" with the Abs then the best thing to do is to redo the experimental run and re-run the gel.

Only living organisms can produce amylase. Animals produce only alpha-amylase. Plants, bacteria, and fungi produce both beta- and alpha- amylases. Like all proteins, the presence of amylase in food depends on if it is permanently denatured by high enough temperatures or extremes in pH. Interestingly, amylases can be classified into high/intermediate/low thermostability groups, depending on whether they become inactivated at a certain temperature. Taking this into consideration, saliva would definitely have alpha-amylase. Bread and biscuits may have alpha or beta amylase (depending on baking temperatures/pH, if amylase was added at all, and if it comes from a grain). Of the rest of your list, banana, corn, milk, and sweet potato would have amylase. Honey (not listed) would also have it. Tomato seems to amylase activity as well. For ketchup, it seems to be an added ingredient to speed processing. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sources:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/enzymes/80.amylase.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/enzymes/80.amylase.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/2_7SOFT.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/2_7SOFT.PDF<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/info_12013063_plants-contain-amylase.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ehow.com/info_12013063_plants-contain-amylase.html<\/a> <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ajofai.info/Abstract/Detection%20of%20amylase%20activity%20from%20vegetables%20and%20fruit%20in%20an%20undergraduate%20classroom.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ajofai.info/Abstract/Detection%20of%20amylase%20activity%20from%20vegetables%20and%20fruit%20in%20an%20undergraduate%20classroom.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":28418,"question_id":28408,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1423524843}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28408/do-these-things-contain-amylase","last_activity_date":1423524843,"creation_date":1423330733,"answer_count":1,"title":"Do these things contain amylase?","body":"<p>I have 10 samples of some food or other things and I need to know, if it contains amylase.

There is debate about how to best describe the problem, but narrowly defined, <em>overdiagnosis<\/em> occurs when increasingly sensitive tests - or changing definitions - identify abnormalities that are minor, non-progressive, or likely to resolve on their own, and that, if left untreated, will not cause symptoms or shorten an individual's life. Having a <strong>diagnosis<\/strong> makes well-persons think <em>they're ill<\/em> (overdiagnosis). If they are then treated for this <strong>diagnosis<\/strong>, they are <strong>overtreated.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>An example involving changing definitions pertains to diabetes. When the official definition of <em>diabetes<\/em> changed from having a fasting blood sugar (FBS) of \"X\" or greater to an FBS of \"X-y\" or greater, 1.6 million new diabetics were instantly <em>diagnosed<\/em>, <em>some of whom<\/em> are not likely to develop symptoms and complications and are not likely to benefit from treatment. This is <em>overdiagnosis<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If one goes on to put such a patient (let's say, on the lower end, \"X-y+1\" on a blood sugar (BS) lowering agent, and they pass out because their BS drops too low, then they are <em>overtreated<\/em>. If they happened to be driving when they pass out, and get into a fatal accident, they literally die from overtreatment, <em>if it can't be shown that they would have suffered from a marginally elevated FBS.<\/em> (If it can be shown to be dangerous to have an FBS of X-y+1, then this is a risk of <em>treatment<\/em>, not <em>overtreatment<\/em>.)<\/p>\n\n<p>For an example of increased sensitivity of tests, say a new test is available, a blood test called a \"D-dimer\", which will reveal with 100% accuracy the presence of a dangerous pulmonary embolism (it's <em>very sensitive<\/em>). However, it is also known to be positive when there is no pulmonary embolism as well, but it's not known how often (so it's <em>not specific<\/em>). But it's an exciting new test! <\/p>\n\n<p>A patient goes into the Emergency room for <em>one<\/em> of the following: atypical chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, leg pain consistent with a blood clot in the calf, or loss of consciousness. In addition to an EKG, chest x-ray (CXR) and a few other tests, a <em>D-dimer<\/em> is ordered. The EKG, CXR and other tests are negative, but the D-Dimer is positive. The tentative diagnosis is pulmonary embolism (PE).<\/p>\n\n<p>Because the D-dimer indicates that a dangerous condition <em>may be present<\/em>, a spiral CAT Scan with contrast is ordered on all those people. Some will have a life-threatening PE (appropriately diagnosed*). A large number will have a negative CAT Scan. (<em>diagnosis excluded<\/em>) But a significant number will have a very small PE. Because this is relatively new and surprising, and it's not known whether they should be treated (maybe nothing will happen if they don't treat? Maybe this happens in normal people and we just never knew it?), the doctors, who are accustomed to treating <strong>all PE's<\/strong> will put the patients on blood thinners. This is <strong>overdiagnosis<\/strong> of PE, and treating it is <strong>overtreatment<\/strong>, because some treated people will have \"bleeds\" - a stroke, GI bleeding, other. It is now known that these tiny PE's are often seen in patients who suffer <em>no harm at all<\/em> from them, therefore in order to stem <em>overdiagnosis<\/em> (and subsequent <em>overtreatment<\/em>), the D-dimer test is ordered less frequently.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...[We] are in the midst of an <strong>epidemic of diagnosis<\/strong>. Conventional wisdom tells us that finding problems early saves lives because we have the opportunity to fix the problems early. [Conventional wisdom tells us that} There is no risk in finding things early.

During weather\n  favourable to pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers increased\n  pollen deposition on stigmas of young flowers, but this difference was\n  not evident in older flowers, probably because of autonomous\n  self-pollination in poorly visited flowers. Total pollen receipt per\n  stigma decreased with increasing fertile display size. In the\n  population with more pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers\n  increased fruit number but not seed set or mass, whereas in the other\n  population sterile flowers enhanced seeds per fruit, but not fruit\n  production. These contrasts are consistent with dissimilar\n  cross-pollination and autonomous self-pollination, coupled with the\n  strong predispersal inbreeding depression exhibited by L. comosa\n  populations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yURN0.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n","answer_id":19663,"question_id":19610,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1405356477}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19610/why-are-neutral-sterile-female-flowers-present-in-inflorescences-when-they-are","last_activity_date":1423418372,"creation_date":1405140852,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why are neutral [sterile] female flowers present in inflorescences when they are reproductively incompatible?","body":"<p>In many compound and special inflorescences like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spadix\" rel=\"nofollow\">spadix<\/a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_hypanthodium\" rel=\"nofollow\">hypanthodium<\/a> there are sterile female flowers along with male and female fertile flowers and are often present in between male and female flowers, but what is their need in an inflorescence?<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/kb0dT.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vaAvj.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know inflorescences are meant for perpetuation of a plant's race by pollination of female flowers by the male gametes [pollen grains which bears vegetative and reproductive cells].<\/p>\n\n<p>I know the infertile female flowers of the spadix inflorescence possess some surface area and this area would get some of the pollen grains which are coming in to the inflorescence, and eventually a sum of pollen grains might go in vain.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is the need of sterile female flowers when fertile ones are present in it?<\/p>\n","question_id":19610,"tags":["botany"],"score":4,"accepted_answer_id":19663,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":259,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1423418372},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f85d6b7b3d252633879bba19350cba5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":13374,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/13374/marian-such","reputation":11,"display_name":"Marian Such"},"closed_date":1423332474,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f437d9a11deebd214089822c26197f35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3553,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3553/james","reputation":4533,"display_name":"James","accept_rate":83},"score":0,"post_id":28403,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423321202,"comment_id":46587,"body":"Fascinating question, but you would get a better answer on <a href=\"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/\">cooking.stackexchange.com<\/a> if you can put it in the format of &#39;how to prepare it for cooking or brewing&#39;."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae0014e2b5be5ac76e0892cdd6f72e8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6289,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6289/l-b","reputation":764,"display_name":"L.B."},"score":0,"post_id":28403,"edited":false,"creation_date":1423326198,"comment_id":46601,"body":"Welcome to Biology S.E!

There are several major differences at the cellular level that distinguish the 2 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_%28biology%29\">Kingdoms<\/a> (Animalia and Plantae). Without getting technical, the most crucial difference in relation to your question is that plants contain <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll\">chlorophyll<\/a>, and as such can generate their own food using sunlight.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is very important when you consider that plants (by definition, those Eukaryotes that contain chlorophyll) have therefore evolved to be very efficient at converting sunlight to 'energy', whereas animals have evolved without this option and have to eat what food they need. So they have instead evolved mechanisms that allow them to forage, or even to hunt, for their food.<\/p>\n\n<p>At some point, a unicellular organism incorporated chlorophyll, leading to multicellular plants in the course of evolution. The ancestor of animals evolved independently from the last common ancestor of plants and animals. Therefore, plants and animals are quite diverged, e.g. in mating 'rituals' (in plants this involves flowers and seeds - whereas in animals there are mating and gestation periods), and systemic changes, such as the immune system and the circulatory system (these are generally much more complex in animals than plants). All of which has stemmed from the difference in evolutionary pressures applied by the choice of food-source.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you have pointed out, there are exceptions to all rules, so not all plants have chlorophyll, but as a rule it is the case!
