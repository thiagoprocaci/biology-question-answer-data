To some extent, if you want to understand how speciation can occur, then you have to consider how you are going to define a species. There is no species concept that applies to all species, past or present. The most widely applied concept is the <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/VA1BioSpeciesConcept.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">biological species concept<\/a> (Mayr 1942), which applies (imperfectly) to sexually reproducing species. Of course, <em>Taenia<\/em> does not always reproduce sexually. I think the discussion of species concepts is beyond this question but I encourage those that are interested to check out references [2-4] as well as a series of papers published in Systematic Zoology in the mid-70s. Here, I'll focus on genetic differentiation with a subtext of reproductive isolation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic differences can accumulate between populations$^1$ of <em>Taenia<\/em> in two different ways. The first is non-adaptive evolution via <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIDGeneticdrift.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift<\/a>. Drift is when allele frequencies change by random processes. For example, just by chance, tapeworms in a particular host may not live very long because the host was killed in a mudslide. Those tapeworms don't produce as many proglottids over their interrupted life so they don't leave as many copies of their alleles. Tapeworms in a host that lives a long time produces lots of proglottids and therefore produce many more copies of their alleles.  The key point here is that the process of genetic drift is random. Allele frequency changes in one population of <em>Taenia<\/em> will be different from allele frequency changes in another population. Thus, over time, different populations of <em>Taenia<\/em> can become genetically different solely by chance. It's called non-adaptive evolution because natural selection is not evolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>Adaptive evolution by natural selection can still occur on individuals that are asexually reproducing. Genetic differences will accumulate in a population over time to due mutations. Some mutations may be beneficial, some may not. Selection can increase the frequency of beneficial mutations and decrease the frequency of very mutations. Note that non-lethal but harmful mutations can accumulate in asexually reproducing species (see <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n12/box/nrg1728_BX1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muller's Ratchet<\/a>) but I am assuming survivorship is decreased by harmful mutations for this example. If we assume that <em>Taenia<\/em> in different populations are subject to different selective pressures, then genetic differences can accumulate, leading to speciation. Note that drift will also affect the allele frequencies of both beneficial and harmful alleles because drift is random.<\/p>\n\n<p>That brings us to the \"mixed-up genes\". I assume you mean the new genetic combinations that occur via sexual reproduction. Even if a host typically has only one individual of <em>Taenia<\/em> (not always the case), I suspect the opportunities for sexual reproduction in a population of <em>Taenia<\/em> are frequent, especially over evolutionary time. Consider places where tapeworm infestation of humans is high. Such places often have poor sanitary conditions so the opportunity for mixing of fecal material from different human hosts is high, and therefore the opportunity for mating among different individuals of <em>Taenia<\/em> is also high. If you have many humans living in squalor over long periods of time, then you have conditions very favorable for sexual reproduction of <em>Taenia<\/em>. Remember too that <em>Taenia<\/em> produce lots of proglottids, each with the chance for reproduction. Each reproductive opportunity creates new genetic combinations potentially subject to natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final point to consider is population size. If the population size of <em>Taenia<\/em> is small (relatively few individuals) then genetic differences can accumulate fairly rapidly by genetic drift but the accumulation of beneficial mutations in the population will be low.

It's true that he goes into a lot of detail and I'm sure his math looks nice but the fact is that it's not grounded in reality. I would consider myself to be something of an expert (in training) in the field of phototransduction, so I'll focus on claims related to it. However, if he's as sloppy with the rest of the visual process as he is with phototransduction, then his claims are entirely bogus.  I'll just be working from the Synopsis section.<\/p>\n\n<p>Where to start...How about the first sentence of the \"Background\" section:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This work originated in the 1960's with the realization that rhodopsin, as then defined, did not meet the requirements for being a chromophore.  It was particularly deficient in the structural characteristics required of a good chromophore.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>FALSE. Rhodopsin is not a chromophore and, to my knowledge no one has ever claimed it to be a chromophore. Rhodopsin is a protein. It is <em>coupled<\/em> with a chromophore, retinal, a form of vitamin A. OK, so if this is the foundation of his research, he is off to a bad start.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The basic assumption had been that the residues of a destructive process could be easily returned to their original state and that state was a simple chemical bond involving only two components in a single molecule...It was assumed that one of the residues was the alcohol or aldehyde of Vitamin A. The other residue was assumed to be a protein and was given the name opsin. Valiant, but unsuccessful, efforts were made to define the nature of the molecule and achieve the formation of rhodopsin in the laboratory. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It absolutely is possible to reconstitute rhodopsin with the chromophore in the lab. This has been going on since <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6224755\">at least 1983<\/a>. Also, the crystal structure of rhodopsin, including the chromophore, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10926528\">was resolved in 2000<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new class of retinoids was defined by the author at that time, the Rhodonines. This class met the requirements of physical chemistry and photochemistry for a high performance chromophore. However, it was difficult to obtain acceptance of the Rhodonines as a replacement for Rhodopsin within the vision research community.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I have never heard of Rhodonines and web searches only result in his page. Due to his confusion of terminology, I don't know if he is proposing them to be proteins (\"replacement for Rhodopsin\") or simple chemical molecules (\"a high performance chromophore\"). If it were the former, one would wonder why Rhodonines were not identified <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22108793\">in a comprehensive proteomics assay of the rod outer segment<\/a>. One would also wonder why rhodopsin is so highly expressed in the outer segment (on the order of 1e8 molecules in mammals and 1e9 molecules in amphibians, more than any other protein in that compartment). If it were the former, one would wonder why there is an <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15177205\">entire biochemical cycle dedicated to recycling retinal<\/a> that takes place just outside the outer segment.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll ignore whatever physical state these Rhodonines are supposedly in since they don't exist. I'll also ignore this \"Activa\" thing. He owns a patent on it, which doesn't bode well for its existence in nature.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The visual system is a very sophisticated system. It uses many of the most sophisticated methodologies known to man at the start of the 21st Century. Failure to recognize these mechanisms and methodologies leads to an inadequate understanding of the overall process. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll agree there, with the exception of the use of the word \"methodologies\"! This isn't engineering, this is biology.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The visual system employs a number of time related processes that have not previously been addressed in the literature. To understand these processes, it is necessary to employ \"complex algebra\" in the differential equations arena. Employing these techniques provides the complete solution to the overall photoexcitation/de-excitation process within the Outer Segment of the photoreceptor<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Phototransduction has a rich history of mathematical modeling. And yes, they involve \"complex algebra in the differential equations arena.\" An excellent review of the first few decades of it can be found in the bible: <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383812100800081\">Phototransduction in vertebrate rods and cones: molecular mechanisms of amplification, recovery and light adaptation<\/a>. Since that publication, there have been two very nice lineages of models: one comprehensive one that focuses on the proteins (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16212700\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19756313\">2<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23693153\">3<\/a>) and one that focuses on spatial accuracy and stochastic interactions and gives more attention to second messengers (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16986276\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400950\">2<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20001089\">3<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It has also been compounded by the historically poor preparation of the researchers in the field of mathematics.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I challenge him to read one of DiBenedetto's modeling papers and not glow in admiration of his mathematical prowess.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The goal has been to present an overall view of the visual system in a defendable mathematical context and a global scientific framework. This goal has required the introduction of techniques and mechanisms not normally found in the literature of vision. This has been particularly true in two areas, the definition and detailing of the initial photodetection process and a similar detailing of the mechanisms of neural signal transmission. In both cases, the dominance of chemically based concepts is shown to have impeded progress. The description of the visual system, including the neural system, as an entirely electronic, more precisely electrolytic, based system leads to much greater insight into the operation of the visual system than any chemically based theory can offer.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I had to quote in full here. This is entirely bogus. The \"initial photodetection process\" (phototransduction) is <em>entirely<\/em> chemical in nature. All of the main players in the process are known and their interactions are largely well understood. Viewing the system as entirely \"electronic\" ignores the mountains of evidence of all of the proteins participating in it.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Probably the most venerable is that of a dichotomy between types of photoreceptors, the rods and cones. The theory demonstrates in excruciating detail that there is only one functional type of photoreceptor cell and that it is associated with one of four types of chromophore. These chromophores are sensitive in the ultraviolet, the short, the medium and the long wavelength portions of the visual spectrum of light.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that if you look at a retina, you can see rods and cones. You can generate knock-out animals that have only one or the other. Those with only rods cannot handle bright visual stimulii, those with only cones cannot see in the dark. More damning is that you have two distinct phototransduction cascades, separated by evolution dating back to the origins of vertebrates. They share only a few proteins in common and otherwise have unique paralogs performing similar duties. You can isolate individual rod cells and, if you're clever and you have the right species, individual cone cells (they're much smaller and harder to harvest in animals like mice or cows). You can measure their electrophysiological characteristics and find that they are extremely different: cone responses are <em>fast<\/em> while rods can respond to a single photon of light. Their morphologies are completely different: the rod outer segment is filled with lipid bilayer disks, while that of the cone has a series of in-folds.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the whole tetrachromat thing, well, again I have to assume that he's referring to opsins when he talks about chromophores. Thanks to genomics, we can be confident that there are only three cone opsin varieties in old world apes (and one rod opsin). The rest of mammals only have two. If you get into other vertebrates, you'll find more...if you get into invertebrates, you'll find ridiculous numbers. There's not much to say here. A fourth cone opsin protein simply does not exist in the human genome.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, that's just a quick overview. Do not worry about this guy's research. It is unsubstantiated and exists in a vacuum outside of the rest of the vision research world. I do wish that there were a way for him to work with others. I do wish there were a way for him to integrate current knowledge into his work. But the problem is that his work as it stands simply seems to ignore the wealth of data generated on the visual system and instead treats it as some theoretical circuit.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9235,"question_id":9225,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1373578616}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9225/are-these-claims-of-revolutionising-understanding-of-human-vision-and-hearing","last_activity_date":1407167167,"creation_date":1373555511,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are these claims of \"revolutionising\" understanding of human vision and hearing valid?","body":"<p>I've started a hobby machine vision project (and posted some questions to this end on other SE sites) and on a side track, also been looking at relevant research in human vision (and partly, hearing).<\/p>\n\n<p>I came across the work of one \"James T Fulton\" through an excerpt of a book which claims to have \"revolutionised\" our understanding of human vision and hearing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the respective links:\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://neuronresearch.net/vision/\">http://neuronresearch.net/vision/<\/a>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.neuronresearch.net/hearing/\">http://www.neuronresearch.net/hearing/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>I tried cross-verifying these claims via Google, but nothing turned up on searching either for the author or the book (apart from some Amazon links and very obscure references).<\/p>\n\n<p>Considering the controversial natural of the claims made here, I would have imagined some level of debate, but the silence I found on the Internet is puzzling.

There is no communication between the information which patterned your form and the information which heals your body. <\/p>\n","answer_id":20147,"question_id":20129,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1407012600},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15894a0d103ab92a2cd3b1000efca418?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6422,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6422/cornelius","reputation":6008,"display_name":"Cornelius"},"score":5,"is_accepted":true,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1407163514,"creation_date":1407154488,"body":"<p>Human skin is made up of three layers [1]:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Epidermis; it contains no blood vessels; it has 5 cellular layers (starting from surface):\n<ul>\n<li><strong>stratum corneum<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>stratum lucidum<\/li>\n<li>stratum granulosum<\/li>\n<li>stratum spinosum<\/li>\n<li>stratum germinativum<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Dermis; it is separated from the above by the <strong>basal membrane<\/strong>; made up of connective tissue (with blood vessels and nerve endings)<\/li>\n<li>Hypodermis - it is not even considered part of the skin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray940.png#mediaviewer/File:Gray940.png\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Gray940.png\" alt=\"Gray940.png\"><\/a><br>\"<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gray940.png#mediaviewer/File:Gray940.png\">Gray940<\/a>\".

Skin is a very important organ. It protects from pathogens, it maintains body temperature, it keeps body water [1], etc. How? That depends on what causes the regeneration. I've emphasized two terms in the above list.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Stratum corneum<\/em> represents the \"skin cells that becomes the dust in our homes and it always grows back to full thickness\". It is lost during a physiological process called desquamation [2]. The cells that are lost are non living corneocytes. Their only purpose is to from a protection barrier [3].<\/li>\n<li><em>Basement membrane<\/em> holds the germinativum layer of the epidermis. Injuries that do not affect it are repaired by complete regeneration of all destroyed layers. However, if the injury destroys membrane continuity, the germinative cells on the edges will fail to \"reconnect\" with each other, thus the layers derived from them will follow the same rule. A process of fibrosis is triggered. The result of  extensive fibrosis is a scar, containing collagen secreted by the granulation tissue with dermal origins. Yet, the germinative layer tends to join back together [6], but probably the excess collagen production, without the limiting basement membrane, bulges into the epidermis and limits germinative layer extension. That's why keeping the edges of the tissue close to each other reduces excessive fibrosis and allows germinative layer regeneration, thus resulting in none to small, barely visible scars.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>How deep should an injury be in order not to affect basement membrane? No more than 0.06 to 0.08 mm [5].<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about skin transplants ?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Skin grafts contain at least a part of dermis [4], which will allow granulation tissue formation thus permitting revascularisation and making the graft stick. Otherwise it would fall off and/or be lost by necrosis.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Skin,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skin&amp;oldid=619454074\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skin&amp;oldid=619454074<\/a> (accessed August 4, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Desquamation,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Desquamation&amp;oldid=614028888\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Desquamation&amp;oldid=614028888<\/a> (accessed August 4, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Stratum corneum,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stratum_corneum&amp;oldid=615247326\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stratum_corneum&amp;oldid=615247326<\/a> (accessed August 4, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Skin grafting,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skin_grafting&amp;oldid=603324006\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skin_grafting&amp;oldid=603324006<\/a> (accessed August 4, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Sandby-Møller J, Poulsen T, Wulf HC. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14690333\">Epidermal thickness at different body sites: relationship to age, gender, pigmentation, blood content, skin type and smoking habits.<\/a> Acta Derm.

Under our armpits we have the so called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrine_sweat_gland\" rel=\"nofollow\">apocrine sweat glands<\/a>\" while most of the rest of our body is covered with \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccrine_sweat_gland\" rel=\"nofollow\">eccrine sweat glands<\/a>\".

Eccrine sweat glands produce sweat, that is made mostly of water and salt, while the apocrine sweat glands sweat contains additionally lipids, proteins and also steroids. Decomposition of the sweat by bacteria which live on our skin produces the typical sweaty odor. The sweat glands also differ in their activation (see <a href=\"https://www.inkling.com/read/dermatology-bolognia-jorizzo-schaffer-3rd/chapter-35/eccrine-apocrine-and-apoeccrine#c30b2757d0144c29a3d57d3c2bc26559\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for more details), so can the apocrine glands be triggered by stress.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to this source (\"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489347\" rel=\"nofollow\">A short history of sweat gland biology<\/a>\") is roughly comparable, although the total numbers vary quite a lot between the single studies.

Note that the origin of life is not a field that is part of evolutionary biology as evolutionary biology only explain the evolution of life and not its origin. As a mathematician you may prefer saying something like the domain of definition of evolutionary biology does not include the origin of life just like the shannon's theory of information says nothing about the euclidian geometry.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What i understand till now is that the \"improvement\" of the dna is a purely random development and the Selection criteria if the improvement was not negative is by surviving<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Hum\u2026 that's sounds very weird. If I didn't know I would hardly recognize that you talk about evolution. You should have a look to some introduction to the field. Also, you should not confound the concepts of evolution, natural selection and mutations that I guess you confuse. A good, extremely simplistic view of evolution is that mutations occurs and create variance in the population. This traits are heritable. The variants that replicate the best increase in frequency in the population while the other variants will decrease in frequency up to the point to disappear. This is called natural selection.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consider a pre-bird without wings, to get wings it has to have interstage with some useless pre-wings and then it has to learn how to flight<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>You also seem to ask a question about how some traits may come to exist while what seem to be necessary intermediate would not be beneficial.

You cannot expect to have a more or less good understanding of the whole science of evolutionary biology in less than a year. But if you are trying to just understand the very basic, sufficiently to persuade you that evolution does occur, then few weeks will probably be enough if you show some effort\nPlease don't forget the questions you may have.

Also, please read @Chris comment below.<\/p>\n\n<p>You misunderstand the meaning of \"direct observation\" that canadianer used. Observations we do in evolutionary biology are just as valid as those that has been made to confirm the theory of gravity. The only point concerns the easiness of understand these observations for non-literate in the field.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, you are totally right. Just like the theory of gravity, the theory of evolution does not explain everything. It only applies to a subset of the phenomenons existing on earth. The theory of evolution is true, we know for a fact that evolution occurs but our theory is not global enough to explain things like the big bang or the surface tension and will never do so. The theory of evolution will never prove or disprove the existence of God as well (supposing you're concerned about that) because again it is not within its scope and will never be. However, the sociological impact of this theory tells much about the human behavior and our difficulties to accept something we know to be true if it contradicts some pre-establish believes even when these pre-established believes are not based on any logical developments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your question has been closed because it is too broad. The issue also is that your questions concern much more than evolutionary biology and biology. It also concerns the very nature of science and this is a common reason why creationist missundestand evolution.

Basically, to get the height of the stack of letters for every position one has to calculate <strong>the degree of certainty about the residue<\/strong> (= degree of conservation) at this position in the sequences belonging to this class. I'll explain what it means:<\/p>\n\n<p>The key parameter in this context is <strong>information<\/strong>. 1 bit of information can be understood as the amount \"knowledge\" you get when receiving an answer to one yes/no question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's say we have equal proportions of all four bases at a certain position in a set of DNA sequences. To \"guess\" a base at this position in some sequence we have to ask two binary questions. For example: \"is it Pyrimidine?\" If 'yes' we'd ask \"is it 'T'?\" Otherwise: \"is it G?\". So, when the frequencies are equal we can get 2 bits of information from one observation of a base at this position in a sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the frequencies are distorted, we already have some ideas about the bases when coming to an individual observation. If we already know, say, that we have just G and A at this position with ratio of 1:1, we can just ask \"is it G?\", so we get clearly 1 bit. When the ratios are not even (or when the number of alternative states is not 2<sup>n<\/sup>), the analogy with the questions becomes much less clear and we have to resort to the very simple formula for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28Information_theory%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shannon entropy<\/a>. Intuition and brief inspection of this formula would bring you the idea, that when the ratios of the residues are biased, we always have less information than for the case of equal frequencies (2 in the case of DNA).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now to estimate the \"the degree of certainty\" we simply calculate the information based on the observed frequencies of different residues at this position and subtract it from the theoretical maximum (again: 2 in the case of DNA):<\/p>\n\n<p>certainty = maximal information possible - actual information<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This value defines the height of a stack of letters at each position<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>maximum<\/strong> value (2 bits) would be observed when we always have the same base, because \"actual information\" would be zero (there is no need to ask questions - we \"know\" the answer anycase). The <strong>minimum<\/strong> (0 bits) is when we have no idea about the base. <strong>One bit<\/strong> would be obtained if we had, say, just two equally frequent bases. And, for example, the value of 0.6 would be observed if you had, e.g. 68.5% of the time the same base A and in all other case C, G or T with equal frequencies of 10.5%.<\/p>\n\n<p>B. As you probably already know: <strong>the proportions of all alternative bases are shown as relative heights of individual letters.<\/strong><\/p>\n","answer_id":20143,"question_id":20104,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1406994471}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20104/how-do-i-read-a-sequence-logo","last_activity_date":1406994471,"creation_date":1406820470,"answer_count":1,"title":"How do I read a sequence logo?","body":"<p>I'm looking at a paper that uses several sequence logos to illustrate the consensus sequence of certain sites. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here is the most important of the sequence logos I'm interested in:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qGOKC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The explanations I found about the exact meaning of this visualization were rather abstract and mathematical.

This is because of the prevalence of resistance to beta lactam drugs including amoxycillin. If we were to invent a brand new never before seen beta lactam drug and started using it irresponsibly, there would probably be resistant bacteria within 5 years. The same beta lactam core structure that makes the drugs work against the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery make it susceptible to attack by beta lactamase. A new beta lactam could avoid the lactamase for a while, but the same evolutionary pressures that selected for resistant mutants against the other beta lactams would select for mutants resistant against the new one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the fluoroquinolines you mention. Their mechanism of action is different, they inhibit DNA synthesis by blocking topoisomerase II activity. But once a bacterial strain is selected for that has resistance against one member of a class of antibiotic it's relatively easy for it to acquire the mutations that confer resistance against other members of the class. Changing the structure of the drug enough so that cannot be defeated by the mechanism of resistance while retaining the drugs mechanism of action is probably impossible, or at least we haven't done it yet.

Why?<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons that this could happen, but I want to know which reasons contribute the most, or what other reasons I haven't thought of could be involved. So, here's my list of theories:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Animals that are prone to disease usually die when very young, while humans in developed countries are given vaccinations/medical attention and have a much greater chance to live to adulthood and advanced age. However, even taking this into consideration, it seems like human populations in third-world countries with little or no access to medicine are much, <em>much<\/em> more riddled with disease than animal populations appear to be. (Or do they only look that way because that's what we see the most of in the news?)<\/p>\n\n<p>2) The animals that we see in documentaries are generally purposely selected for viewing as being healthy individuals or a mostly healthy group. This doesn't account for YouTube's many amateur safari videos and pictures, however, where it still seems like animals die much more from territorial disputes or preying than of disease. Safari-goers aren't likely to sit around filming diseased animals, but it still seems like animals 'in the background' and in herds appear to generally be very healthy when it'd be pretty easy to notice a somehow diseased or disabled person in an equivalently large group on the sidewalk.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Most humans don't know what common wildlife diseases look or sound like, and at a distance they all appear healthy to us even if there is a roughly equivalent percentage of disease among adult animals as among adult humans.<\/p>\n\n<p>3a) Animals are much better at concealing the symptoms of their common diseases than the average human, as a defense mechanism from predators. (I know that cats are particularly good at not showing that they're in pain, but I'm not sure how many other animals behave this way.)<\/p>\n\n<p>4) While most modern humans go out of their way to do every possible thing they can to make sure an infant survives, animal parents purposely kill, abandon or even eat young that they can sense are diseased or disabled in some way. I saw an example of this on a youtube video where a lion cub was gored by a cape buffalo and its back legs were paralyzed. After numerous failed attempts to nudge the cub into standing or walking properly, the mother purposely killed the cub with a suffocating bite and ate it. <em>(Did/do humans practice this to any significant extent? I once read about a culture, can't remember which, that didn't consider an infant viable enough to even name until it was at least 3 months old. I also read that either the ancient Greeks or the Romans would bathe a newborn in wine, and if it survived, it was deemed strong enough to deserve a chance at life. I don't know how true either of these claims are, though. But that's kind of a different question, so consider it optional 'bonus points' to answer.)<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>5) Diseased and disabled animals are killed off by predators or rivals quickly enough that the populations we see are filled with healthy animals just because the infirm are constantly weeded out. This doesn't address animals that have few/no natural predators or rivals, such as in the case of areas that have so many deer with no natural predators that human hunters must cull them to keep them from reproducing out of control. Are these populations more prone to adulthood diseases than populations that have natural predators?<\/p>\n\n<p>6) At about seven billion, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/11/03/141946751/along-with-humans-who-else-is-in-the-7-billion-club\" rel=\"nofollow\">humans are easily the most populous species that is the size of humans<\/a>. Other animals with larger populations are much smaller than humans. Compared to other animals of our size or larger, we are intensely overcrowded, leading to lots of people coming in contact with lots of other people all the time, frequently on an international scale as thousands of planes and ships travel around the world on a daily basis. This only covers contagious diseases, though. Even the most isolated hermit could die from a genetic condition that he had since before he was born.<\/p>\n\n<p>7) Stress. Animals live what we would consider to be a very high-stress life, but they experience their stress in short, intense bursts. Humans, even (especially!) those who live in first-world countries with lots of information to learn and lots of things to do, often get to the point where they can't figure out where the 'off' switch for their stress is. Stress is a silent, gradual killer, and it's possible that minor genetic conditions that may have otherwise been fairly benign or unnoticed turn ugly as a person ages through a life where stress is constant.<\/p>\n\n<p>8) Diet. It's no secret that there's a lot of heart disease and other diet-related issues in the modern world, but I don't know if that covers ancient humans, and there seems to have been plenty of disease to go around in the olden days even when people ate purely natural foods.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can't think of any other theories at the moment. One way I thought of to possibly help answer this question was to take into consideration domestic animals - how many diseases do veterinarians have to treat compared to how many diseases human doctors have to treat? This line of thought is rather tainted by the fact that domestic animals are often given vaccinations of their own, though, but it doesn't seem like they receive nearly as many as humans do.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my first time asking a question on stackexchange, so I hope I've given you plenty of meat to chew on with this post.

For instance HIV targets a type of lymphocytes (cells of the immune system), other viruses may only target bacteria (these are called bacteriophages) and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>How is this specificity achieved? Well, to put it simply, viruses \"anchor\" to specific <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\" rel=\"nofollow\">proteins<\/a> (or other molecules) that are sitting on the membrane of their target cells and that allows them to go in. If a cell does not have that specific protein, then the virus cannot infect it.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in your story, maybe the target population will have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutation<\/a> in their genome that will modify a certain protein.

If you want to hit some valid heavy science jargon, I recommend saying the virus was made with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">recombineering<\/a>, using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_artificial_chromosome\" rel=\"nofollow\">bacterial artificial chromosome<\/a> (BAC), with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_labelling\" rel=\"nofollow\">florescent marker<\/a> to make the scientist's life easier (mush harder to work with viruses without nice markers).<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-876-4_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">methods paper<\/a> that describes that exactly, and has the advantage of of a <a href=\"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/736/chp%253A10.1007%252F978-1-61779-876-4_3.pdf?auth66=1407078150_5ccead0e566871f7469d6a981b1e5c8d&amp;ext=.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">free published protocol<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>My problem with this method (using an HLA type to target) is that if you're targeting MHC Class II, it's going to be hard to kill the victim quickly.  Kill off all the cells would give a person AIDS, but not necessarily lead to a quick death.  Targeting MHC Class I could get around this, but then you're not targeting specific cells (could be nerves, could be skin cells), and the person would probably mount a pretty good immune response.  You'd probably have to hit the person with a pretty high dose to be sure you were infecting the cells you wanted to kill.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're willing to allow a two-step process, I think the more targeted approach would be to create an inducible latent virus.  Take one that commonly infects humans like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cytomegalovirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">CMV<\/a>, and modify it so that it was only induced out of latent infection by a specific trigger (tagged food for example).  Then further modify it so that it generates a highly toxic protein when it comes out of latency, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin\" rel=\"nofollow\">botulinum<\/a>, that will both kill the person very quickly and have the possible appearance of something natural.  If you use food is a trigger, then health workers would eventually figure out were all these people were eating and accuse them of food poising with botulism.  Whether that can help your character in the plot, I don't know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Back to the creation of the virus, I would still use the method above, though it's important to note that botulinum is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">select agent<\/a>, and that proper <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level\" rel=\"nofollow\">BSL<\/a> would be a serious concern.  Have a hard time imagining it going down in someone's garage without them killing themselves.  But if the person known how/has materials for gene synthesis (many, many labs do), then acquisition is just a question of making the gene for the published botulinum sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>It does occur to me that I might not should even post this based on it's ability to work...feel free to vote/comment to close if that is conciseness.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20133,"question_id":19380,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L9Qqu.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5784,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5784/5heikki","reputation":428,"display_name":"5heikki"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1406907508,"creation_date":1406907508,"body":"<p>I would pick some virus that infects all people but then engineer it to not work properly on some specific host cells, e.g. some allele somehow preventing transcription of some key viral protein sort of like RNAi..<\/p>\n","answer_id":20134,"question_id":19380,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19380/theoretically-what-technique-would-one-use-to-modify-a-virus-so-that-it-only-af","last_activity_date":1406907508,"creation_date":1404117515,"answer_count":4,"title":"Theoretically, what technique would one use to modify a virus so that it only affected a subset of the population?","body":"<p>I'm writing a novel and i would like to know some of the equipment and techniques involved with modifying a virus.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is it feasible for a virus to be engineered to only affect certain people?

At birth you will have a finite number of each stem cell type (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells that make blood, gut epithelium stem cells that make gut lining etc).  The general picture is that as tissues require replenishment, a stem cell divides. One daughter cell starts to differentiate (and divide) into mature cells required by the tissue, whereas the other daughter cell retains stem cell function.   <\/p>\n\n<p>So a stem cell is typically defined as a cell with the capacity to: (i) self-renew <em>and<\/em>  (ii) to give rise to one or more cell types in a tissue. A hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to T-cells, B-cells, neutrophils, red blood cells, platelets etc.  The ability to <em>self-renew<\/em> means that, in general, stem cells don't 'run out' during a lifetime.  <\/p>\n\n<p>[ Its important to note that to define a cell as a stem cell, scientists use strange hybrid of: in vitro or animal assays + cell surface markers + location in the tissue + measures of 'having the capacity to make continued contribution to new cells'.  So lets just say that stem cells are only ever as well defined as our choice of assays combined with the interpretation of those results. ]<\/p>\n\n<p>I mention the challenge of defining stem cells because, in recent years as assays and technologies improved, cells such a oocytes (eggs) or adult neurons, which were once thought to be finite, have been shown to have be replaced/renewed, presumably by some 'stem cell like' cell(s).<\/p>\n\n<p>As noted above, stem cells are usually involved in the replenishment of a particular tissue type.  So liposuction, which will remove fat cells, should not affect the numbers of hematopoietic or neural stem cells and so on. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any claim of clinical benefit of a 'stem cell treatment' using liposuction should be backed by clear data.   <\/p>\n\n<p>A longer answer would get into: \n(i) the concept of 'plasticity' where the classical view - a fixed pathway between a stem cell giving rise to one daughter cell that  gives rise to mature cells and the other returns to a stem cell state - is open for debate, and \n(ii) the idea that since stem cell definitions are only as good as our assays, there may be potential plasticity even among stem cells that we cannot 'detect' yet.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17780,"question_id":17773,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1401506545},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f66eb54d7137d4cb7e7698b751d10533?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6889,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6889/pb-jelly","reputation":1,"display_name":"PB_Jelly"},"score":-3,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":17812,"edited":false,"creation_date":1401736431,"comment_id":25600,"body":"theoretically yes to what?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f66eb54d7137d4cb7e7698b751d10533?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6889,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6889/pb-jelly","reputation":1,"display_name":"PB_Jelly"},"score":0,"post_id":17812,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"edited":false,"creation_date":1401777730,"comment_id":25613,"body":"Theoretically it could inhibit the body&#39;s ability to repair itself and cause an earlier death.

However, it is possible to die from causes other than a deficiency in healing ability. Most people in the world die from cardiovascular disease and cancer. <\/p>\n\n<p>The role of stem cells in the heart is an area of intense investigation. Vascular clogging is a more likely cause of cardiovascular failure than a disease of the heart muscle itself. In the case of clogged vessels, no biological mechanism exists to heal clogged arteries. Stem cells are irrelevant here. <\/p>\n\n<p>Stem cells are most applicable to cancer in the immune system for the recognition of cancer cells. A decrease in actively dividing immune stem cells would correlate with an increased progression of cancer. This is exactly what happens with people undergoing chemotherapy. Chemotherapy kills actively dividing cells, including stem cells in the immune system. This is why they often suffer increased infections. It is rare to die from an infectious disease today. Decreased immune response from chemotherapy is a manageable side effect of treating cancer. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you recreationally took chemotherapy drugs, this would inhibit the activity of stem cells. Your body would rapidly accumulate genetic mutations and systemic damage resulting in eventual death.

In this condition, they have a very long shelf-life and need no cooling. Before use they are dissolved in water and then administered.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is another problem with mixing these vaccines: Live vaccines can not be given to anybody, people which have a weakened immune system (because of an infection like HIV, chemotherapy or the adimistration of drugs, which downregulate the immune system after an organ transplantation) are not able to receive them.

The FDA publishes a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm093833.htm\">wonderful list<\/a> of every approved vaccine for use in the US.  Of the 78 vaccines listed (and there is a lot of redundancy due to different manufacturers etc), only 16 are live attenuated (or about 20%).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to notice is that we have vaccines to both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus\">viruses<\/a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria\">bacteria<\/a>.   Technically, some of the vaccines are to bacterial toxins, not bacteria themselves, but for the sake of simplicity, we're going to group all bacterial <a href=\"http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/components.htm\">component, subunit, and inactivated vaccine preparations<\/a> together in one group.<\/p>\n\n<p>First you will note that there is only one live attenuated vaccine for bacteria, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_bovis\">Mycobacterium bovis<\/a> (more on this exception later).  There are several reasons for this, but as a general rule, you don't want to put a foreign object capable of self replication inside a person.  Viruses cannot self replicate, they are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate_parasite\">obligate parasites<\/a> by definition, so they don't fall under this rule.  One could, however engineer bacteria that were sufficiently deficient in replication that this might not be an issue.  Another safety concern with live attenuated bacteria is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis\">sepsis<\/a>.  Again by choosing a delivery route that doesn't involve injections, you might be able to mitigate this risk.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also want to be clear that I think live attenuated bacterial/fungal (yeast mostly) vaccines can work more broadly, and are likely to be used in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.029\">innovative vaccine strategies<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The main obstacle to a live attenuated bacteria vaccine is that the component and subunit vaccines <strong>work<\/strong>.  Sometimes they work even better by only supply the part of an organism that is known to provide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody#Broadly-neutralizing_antibodies\">broad neutralization<\/a> (getting rid of) of the pathogen.  And if you know that you can provide protection with out the risk of putting the live organism in a person, why would you take that risk?<\/p>\n\n<p>Quite simply you don't.  Back to <em>M. bovis<\/em>.  For the most part, humans are not vaccinated with <em>M. bovis<\/em> (BCG) to prevent <em>M. Bovis<\/em> infection (though <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis\">zoonotic<\/a> infections can <a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1996/WHO_EMC_ZOO_96.4.pdf\">occur<\/a>).  Instead it is to prevent <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis\">M. tuberculosis<\/a><\/em> (MTB) infection.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine\">Attenuation<\/a> of MTB is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544749/\">difficult<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC23125/\">not complete<\/a>.  Indeed we don't have a subunit or component vaccine that has worked for MTB, and an inactivated MTB has <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3515764/\">more safety concerns<\/a> than BCG.  Thus we choose a related organism, <em>M. Bovis<\/em>, which naturally doesn't cause disease in humans (or rarely), but can provide some protection against TB.  Even the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM202934.pdf\">product insert<\/a> admits that efficacy of the vaccine is in question.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same pattern of necessity holds true for viral live attenuated vaccines.  They are used when you need a more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity\">immunogenic<\/a> vaccine, and where we haven't been able to make safe and effective, inactivated, subunit, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus-like_particle\">VLP<\/a> vaccines.  Thus when you need a live attenuated vaccine, you really do need it to be alive for it work.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Answering the core question:<\/h2>\n\n<p>As @MattDMo pointed out, the storage conditions are very different for live attenuated vaccines.  Not only that, but most of the <a href=\"http://cellculturedish.com/2011/10/recombinant-albumin-enhances-stability-of-attenuated-vaccines/\">preservatives<\/a> used in many inactivated vaccines cause <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer\">titer<\/a> loss (though there is <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.vaccine.2011.07.054\">work<\/a> to find alternatives). <\/p>\n\n<p>On the theory that a picture is worth a thousand words, I did a little experiment just for this post (and also I was cleaning out an -80).  I took a high titer stock of measles virus that has a protein tag on one of the proteins so we can easily detect it (F is Flag tagged).  Then I spiked 3 different tubes of virus in ether <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_buffered_saline\">PBS<\/a> (saline) or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002021.htm\">DTaP<\/a> (an actual dose, just past expiration), and left them in the refrigerator (4oC) for 8h.  Note that <a href=\"https://www.merckvaccines.com/Products/Mmr/Pages/storageandhandling\">Merk thinks<\/a> you should toss the measles vaccine if you don't use it within 8/hours (also note their comment on preservatives).  Then I infected some cells that grow up measles, and harvested the cells in a total cell lysate.  Finally I ran equal amounts of total protein form each preparation on a gel for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot\">western blot<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1J8S.png\" alt=\"Western of 3 measles replicates\"><\/p>\n\n<p>You should notice the three pairs of bands, in each case the lighter band (indicating less protein) belongs to the DTaP group.  That is to say less measles F protein (something you want to make antibodies to) came from the samples that were put into the DTaP vaccine compared to PBS.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Another serious problem is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_chain\">cold chain<\/a>:<\/h2>\n\n<p>Again we need the virus to be \"alive\" when we give a person a vaccine.  This almost always means that we have to keep it frozen or at least refrigerated from the manufacturer, all the way up until moments before it goes into a person's arm.  There are <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2014.05.007\">many good<\/a> reviews on cold chain to be found.  Quite simply, inactivated and component vaccines do not have the thermo-stability requirements that live vaccines do.  It would be a waste of energy in most cases to chill all of the vaccines which could be left at room temperature, and it would remove one of their clear advantages.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the immunology is concerned, there is probably not a real limit on what the body can react to.  Indeed, as you point out, they are often administered at the same time in developed countries.  It is merely a question of how you can keep live-attenuated vaccines \"alive\" in the same preparation.  It is certainly possible that there is a solution to this, and vaccine stability is an active field of research.  Hopefully in 10-20 years we will be able to adjust this answer to say that such a vaccine has been made, and that it's safe enough for approval.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20110,"question_id":17845,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1406837613}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17845/is-it-possible-to-combine-live-attenuated-and-non-live-vaccines","last_activity_date":1406837613,"creation_date":1401749949,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is it possible to combine live attenuated and non-live vaccines?","body":"<p>There are many combination vaccines available but I've noticed that there don't seem to be any with both live and non-live components, e.g. DTaP/IPV/MMR.

For increasing the confidence in a certain hit, it was sequenced from both the ends. \nFor example, if you have selected 500bp DNA fragment, then after ligating adapters to both the ends, it is sequenced from both the direction up to 150bp. This would leave an unsequenced \"insert\" region of 200bp. (In the example image below, they have sequenced up to 40bp [case of old GA] )<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vhJwd.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>During assembly you stitch together the fragments of DNA to find out the larger DNA from where the fragments arise. In case of RNAseq, these arise from a transcript, and your assembly should give you the complete transcript (mRNA or ncRNA etc). There are two basic types of assembly: reference guided assembly and de-novo assembly. In the former you use a sequence such as the genome as a reference to assemble the transcripts. If such a reference is not available then you have to go for de-novo assembly.<\/p>\n\n<p>The assembly algorithms use several parameters and since these are computer algorithms and not some kind of magic, their output depends to an extent on the different parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p>In case of paired end data there are some parameters that are important. Most important is the size of the insert. In case of a 500bp fragment, you'll end up with an unsequenced region of 200bp. This is not much of a problem with reference guided assembly because you can figure out the sequence of the insert based on where the sequenced region align to the reference. The average insert length is important to remove discordant reads (aligning too far apart in the reference). In case of de-novo assembly, the insert will remain unsequenced even if you know that the final transcript looks something like:<\/p>\n\n<p><code>frag1-frag6-frag3-frag9-frag4<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>So, to get the sequence of the assembly, you need to sequence the insert regions. This is not a problem if you at least know the order of fragments in the assembly. However you should know the insert size to get the assembly size correct and as skyminge said, in scaffolding. Obtaining this insert length is not that difficult (You need not provide it as a parameter. Most algorithms can calculate it automatically).<\/p>\n\n<p>Another parameter in de-novo assembly is k-mer length (the sequence reads are broken down into k-mers for better assembly). I cannot explain the algorithm of assembly here in detail. You can check the manuals/papers of common assembly algorithms like Velvet, SOAPdenovo, Euler [de novo]; cufflinks [reference based]<\/p>\n\n<p>I have mentioned transcriptome sequencing here but the principles are same for genome sequencing too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Back to your main question:\n<em>Why is assembling paired end illumina without any input parameters an important problem?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Because it is less effort; but tweaking may be difficult.

The paper you cite tries to determine whether rotifers become more r or more K selective in different environments. <\/p>\n\n<p>The thought here on k-selection is not almost from the definitions of the term, which is why it isn't explained in the paper.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In R-selected strategies, many more offspring are produced, but less investment is made in each one.  Think about a cockaroach laying thousands of tiny eggs.  The hatchlings might be eaten by their own mother; they are so 'cheap' the insect who layed the eggs doesn't have any anxiety about their survival.  In extreme cases, most of these hatchlings will not reproduce, they may even be a bit of food for the ones which do reach maturity. <\/p>\n\n<p>In k-selected strategies, very few offspring are produced.  In addition to the 'cost of sex' limitation, they are invested in so heavily that the female may stop being fertile for a while.  An example would be how female mammals which are lactating are not fertile or seasonal mating like many birds do; the females turn off reproduction so that they can focus on the success of one or two produced offspring. <\/p>\n\n<p>k-selection is advantageous over R-selection when more of their investment pays off.  If one out of ten R-offspring survive and one out of four k-selected offspring survive, then for these competing rotifers, the k-selected strategy is advantageous. <\/p>\n\n<p>The cost of sex is that its half as efficient as asexual reproduction because males don't really reproduce - they only provide genetic material for females.  You can argue r/K selection independently of this factor, but the article is suggesting that k-selection can be so advantageous as to also give sexual selection an advantage over asexual selection.  I think asexual reproduction could be k-selected as well, but that seems to be the point being made here. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason that k/R has toned down in importance in the past couple of decades is that it has been found that individual species can adapt to shift their k/R strategems. <\/p>\n","answer_id":17456,"question_id":17454,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1406743056}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17454/two-fold-cost-of-sex-and-r-k-selection-theory","last_activity_date":1406743056,"creation_date":1400220880,"answer_count":1,"title":"Two-fold cost of sex and r/K selection theory","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23496758\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article<\/a> cites a bunch of articles (I haven't been through them) that the effect of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction#Two-fold_cost_of_sex\" rel=\"nofollow\">two-fold cost of sex<\/a> is \"reduced\" in stable environment or in K-selected environment.

The two-fold fecundity advantage of asexual reproduction is always a two-fold fitness advantage, regardless of whether it is in a K- or r-selected environment.

The usual methods (either chemical competent cells or electroporation) are working fine, although electroporation might give you better results, as the cells take up more DNA. On the downside you have to make sure that your cells are prepared nicely, otherwise the electroporation cell will produce a short circuit (of course chemically competent cells can be problematic, too).<\/p>\n\n<p>What you will definitely need are two (or more) different selection markers. The easiest will probably be different antibiotics (something I used in the lab and which works nicely) or other like genes which provide essential substances for the cells. As long as the selection pressure on the cells is held up, both plasmids will stay in the cells, when you take away one of them, the corresponding plasmid will get lost within a few days.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding the efficiency of co-transformations I haven't found any papers. There is however, some data available on factors which influence the effiency of single transformations and I don't see, why these shouldn't be applied for co-transformations as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, there is the size of the plasmid.

The most commonly found explanation, and the one I am grown accustomed to, is the scarcity of resources, resources meaning food and nesting places. <\/p>\n\n<p>For years I have considered this a quite convenient explanation but recently I came to rethink it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you know, many of the longest migrating birds are insectivorous such as European Pied Flycatcher that breeds in much of Europe and western Asia but spends winters in western Africa. While it is easy to see the scarcity of food (insects) in northern breeding areas during winters, it is more difficult for me to see the scarcity of food in southern wintering areas during summers. - Take, for example, ants, that I expect, are abundant in those places all year around. Considering their total biomass, they would seem to hold a potential for a stable food source for masses of insect eaters with minimal food gathering effort required. So why migrate?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is it that ants (or any other seemingly overly abundant invertebrates such as termites and mosquitoes) are not nutritious enough? Or are they too stingy and poisonous perhaps?<\/p>\n\n<p>As for nesting places, I am aware that many birds defend their home range (thereby setting an upper limit for population density), but I imagine that such behaviour could be subject to change (or never had emerged in the first place) if there was no need to compete for other resources (mainly for food).<\/p>\n\n<p>Or are the primary constraining factors disease and predation that would follow from a larger population density?<\/p>\n\n<p>So in short, my question is, what is (/are) the primary reasons(s) for insectivorous birds to migrate instead of staying in their wintering areas and feeding on (seemingly abundant) local resources such as ants?<\/p>\n","question_id":17109,"tags":["zoology","entomology","ornithology"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1399105024},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJMzA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4587,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4587/kisunminttu","reputation":66,"display_name":"Kisunminttu"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15894a0d103ab92a2cd3b1000efca418?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6422,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6422/cornelius","reputation":6008,"display_name":"Cornelius"},"score":0,"post_id":13576,"edited":false,"creation_date":1406634849,"comment_id":29971,"body":"Related: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/q/20033/6422\">How common is it to be pregnant with periods?<\/a>"}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15894a0d103ab92a2cd3b1000efca418?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6422,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6422/cornelius","reputation":6008,"display_name":"Cornelius"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1406635939,"creation_date":1406635356,"body":"<p>Here are some causes of bleeding during pregnancy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>early pregnancy (first trimester):\n<ul>\n<li>implantation bleeding [1]<\/li>\n<li>infection [1]<\/li>\n<li>after intercourse [1]<\/li>\n<li>miscarriage [2]<\/li>\n<li>ectopic pregnancy [2]<\/li>\n<li>cervical changes [3]<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>second part of pregnancy:\n<ul>\n<li>abruptio placentae [1, 2]<\/li>\n<li>placenta previa [1, 2]<\/li>\n<li>miscarriage [2]<\/li>\n<li>vasa previa [2]<\/li>\n<li>preterm labour [1]<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>American Pregnancy Association. <em>Bleeding During Pregnancy.<\/em> Available from <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/bleedingduringpreg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/bleedingduringpreg.html<\/a> (accessed 29.07.2014)<\/li>\n<li>U.S. National Library of Medicine.

But bleeding that occurs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy can often be a sign of a possible complication [2].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It happens to about 25 % of pregnant women:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Up to 1 in 4 women have vaginal bleeding at some time during their pregnancy. Bleeding is more commonin the first 3 months (first trimester), especially with twins [3].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Repetitive bleeding is associated with preterm birth:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bleeding of multiple episodes, on multiple days, and with more total blood loss was associated with an approximate twofold increased risk of earlier preterm birth, PPROM (preterm premature rupture of the membranes), and preterm labor. In contrast, bleeding in the second trimester only, of a single episode, on a single day, and with less total blood loss was not associated with any category of preterm birth [4].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>American Pregnancy Association. <em>Am I Pregnant: FAQs On Early Pregnancy.<\/em> Available from <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/pregnancyfaq.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/pregnancyfaq.htm<\/a> (accessed 29.07.2014)<\/li>\n<li>American Pregnancy Association. <em>Bleeding During Pregnancy.<\/em> Available from <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/bleedingduringpreg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/bleedingduringpreg.html<\/a> (accessed 29.07.2014)<\/li>\n<li>U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Rather than playing with their prey for amusement, cats tire out their victims to the point where they're too worn down to fight back. And after that, the cats will feel better, and safer, about finishing them off, according to researcher Dennis C. Turner. So while it might look like a display of cruelty, a cat playing with its prey is just an (admittedly harsh) example of animal instinct in action [1].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Karen B. London (animal behaviorist) agrees:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Actually, the way that cats let go of and then recapture their prey is not a way for them to have fun, but rather a way for the cats to protect themselves from serious injury. Cats kill their prey by breaking the spinal cord with a strong bite to the neck. If a cat must let go of the animal in order to grab it on the neck, that cat is risking escape or retaliation by their prey [2].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Playing (not only with prey) also gives cats experience and improves their ability to make judgments [3].<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Animal Planet. <em>Why do cats play with their prey?<\/em> Available from <a href=\"http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/why-cats-play-with-prey\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/why-cats-play-with-prey<\/a> (accessed 27.07.2014)<\/li>\n<li>Karen B.
