Rather than highlight one specific drug it is perhaps better to talk about the mechanism of action by which this occurs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Torticollis in a drug induced form is classed as an extrapyramidial side effect. Classically results from some medications which have anti-dopaminergic effects. The neurotransmitter dopamine is important for the regulation of movement. Different medications have different degrees of anti-dopaminergic effect. To complicate things further there are several different types of dopamine receptors and different drugs have different effects depending on their action on these receptors.<\/p>\n\n<p>Classically drugs that have been associated with extrapyramidial side effects are some of the antipsychotics but there are case reports of this with trycyclics <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC489096/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC489096/<\/a> however this appears to be a very rare, see <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X97004057\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X97004057<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The paradoxical treatment of torticollis might be dependent on the cause of the condition.  Tricyclic anti-depressants have anti-cholinergic effects, i.e. they block the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This neurotransmitter works in opposition to dopamine in the basal ganglia (part of the brain responsible for movement control) as such might be used when the dystonia is as a result of doperminergic disregulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are at all concerned that you may be suffering side effects of any medication, then I highly recommend that you go and discuss this matter with your doctor. The above  is a simplified explanation of some of the reasons why these side effects may occur.

In that case, yes you need to compare your protein of interest to a protein (or proteins) of known structure. Homology modelling in a nutshell includes three (four?) steps: template identification/template alignment, modelling, quality assessment.<\/p>\n\n<p>You start with finding a template for your modelling. This is usually done by sequence alignment, for instance BLASTing. Preferably you use multiple sequence alignment which more sensitively aligns conserved regions. You then want a template with as high sequence identity as possible (above 50 % usually produces models with about 1 Å RMSE [<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5540/93.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">1<\/a>] in main chain atoms. Avoid less than 30 % where modelling errors rapidly increase.)<\/p>\n\n<p>There are then a number of different modelling strategies (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling#Model_generation\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia<\/a>). But basically, they all aim to predict the structure of the conserved protein core as well as possible (which usually is what you're really interested in). Peripheral amino acids are more dynamic and more prone to evolution and are therefore more difficult to predict. Then, most importantly, you assess the quality of your model. This can be done by calculating violations of statistical potentials or physics based conformational energies (or using more advanced methods like <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2242555/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multivariate regression methods<\/a>). As in all modelling, this really is a most crucial step because prediction with a poor model is misleading and utterly useless.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you don't find any template you could resort to the exciting field of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_protein_structure_prediction\" rel=\"nofollow\">De novo protein structure prediction<\/a>, where the aim is to predict the structure from the amino acid sequence alone. I am not very familiar with their methods, but de novo prediction is hard (!). I don't remember any exact numbers but the number of conformations in a normal sized protein is astronomically large, which leads to great algorithmic and computational challenges. Additionally, without any reference sequence the model assumptions are greater than those of homology modelling. Although, I have heard that the field has been making great progress the last few years.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit:\nIt struck me that you might be asking about protein fold recognition as well. There exists a large number of different tools and methods for recognizing and locating protein domains using the amino acid sequence as input. Many of them are available as web servers. For instance <a href=\"http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index\" rel=\"nofollow\">phyre<\/a> which uses the amino acid profile and predicted secondary structures to search structure libraries. Threading based methods like <a href=\"http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/MUSTER/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MUSTER<\/a>. A number based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hidden Markov Models<\/a> (HMMs) also exist.

(2004). I was able to find several proposed mechanisms for the monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase but I'll discuss two that seem most relevant in the context of your question.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The first I'll mention was outline by Parikh et al. (2000) who studied recombinant human mitochondrial uracil-DNA glycosylase. They report a mechanism where the glycosidic bond cleavage is not induced by a nucleophilic attack by water but rather by valence electron rearrangement, induced by conformational changes of the substrate by the enzyme, leading to a resonance stabilized oxocarbenium intermediate. This figure (Parikh et al., 2000) shows an electron pushing representation as well as the various stabilizing effects produced by orbital overlaps which favours cleavage of the C-N bond:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Jg8i.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Original caption: Structure-based reaction mechanism that resolves the apparent orthogonal paradox for electron transpositions by altering the substrate stereochemistry. (A) A simplified valence-bond representation of the glycosylic bond dissociation hides the paradox that the three electron pairs to be transposed are involved in orthogonal orbitals. (B) In the normal anti-conformation of deoxyuridine, the σ*-orbital involved in the anomeric effect and the π-orbital of the C2⩵O bond are orthogonal to one another, thus preventing orbital overlap. (C) Severe distortions of the deoxyribose and the glycosylic bond in the strained conformation of deoxyuridine enforced by the UDG active center align the pairs of atomic orbitals participating in each electron transposition, thereby electronically coupling the anomeric and σ-πArom effects to promote bond cleavage. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They also go on to say (emphasis added):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A water is tightly positioned 3.54 Å below the deoxyribose C1\u2032 by four hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3B) but is <strong>likely a poor nucleophile<\/strong>. Instead, the UDG\u2013DNA substrate structure suggests this water is well positioned to become the 1\u2032-α-OH <strong>after<\/strong> dissociation of the incipient deoxyribose oxocarbenium ion from the uracil ring.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is Fig. 3B from the article, where the water molecule is the red sphere at the bottom of the image coordinated by four hydrogen bonds:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ghTBi.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The next mechanism involves a nucleophilic attach by an activated water molecule and was outlined by Drohat et al. (1999) studying <em>Escherichia coli<\/em> uracil-DNA glycosylase. Here is the first step of the mechanism:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lzeu3.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From the  Wikipedia article on uracil-DNA glycosylase: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil-DNA_glycosylase\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil-DNA_glycosylase<\/a> (accessed 15 Jul 2014)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Drohat et al. (1999) describe this:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UDG apparently follows a [...] mechanism by deprotonating the incoming water nucleophile using the completely conserved residue Asp64 as the general base. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the human enzyme support the structural evidence that His187 and Asp64 act as a general acid and base, respectively, because conversion of these groups to leucine and asparagine resulted in 300- and 2500-fold losses in activity (11). However, structural and mutagenesis data alone cannot establish the catalytic roles and ionization states of active site groups; thus other complementary approaches must be utilized to establish a chemical mechanism. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>To answer your question, the water molecule is considered activated because it is a better nucleophile due to proton abstraction by the aspartate residue side chain. Thus the electrons used in in the original O-H bond in water (which are polarized towards the electronegative oxygen) are free to attack the partial positive 1' carbon of the deoxyribose. Although it is a concerted mechanism, you could perhaps think of the nucleophile being the hydroxide anion, which is much stronger than water.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So which mechanism is correct you might ask. Well, I don't know, but I refer you to a paragraph from Parikh et al. (2000):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite the importance of UDG and the many proposed mechanisms for its catalysis of glycosylic bond cleavage, the structural chemistry underlying efficient catalysis by UDG has remained elusive. Two groups, including our own, have proposed a traditional acid-base catalysis carried out by a cationic His-268 and an absolutely conserved Asp-145 (13, 26). Two proposals (27, 28) invoke only general base catalysis via the same catalytic aspartate and a neutral histidine. Another proposal (29), based on a computationally simulated uncleaved-substrate complex, predicts that Asp-145 is fully solvated in the substrate complex so that it cannot act as a general-base catalyst. These proposed mechanisms are inconsistent with each other and with the uncleaved-substrate crystal structure presented here. Moreover, they are problematic in that they rely entirely on functional group chemistry and thus do not adequately explain UDG's efficiency or the activity of mutants that alter evidently key functional groups (13, 27). UDG mutations that remove apparently key active site functional groups are actually faster enzymes than several wild-type DNA glycosylases (30). Thus, without knowledge of a substrate complex structure, the characterization of UDG mechanism is severely hindered. Here, we present the structures of UDG bound to both uncleaved-substrate analog at 1.8-Å resolution and cleaved-product DNA oligonucleotides at 2.0-Å resolution. These high-resolution cocrystal structures suggest how UDG applies part of the DNA-binding energy to glycosylic bond cleavage by conformationally altering its deoxyuridine substrate to take advantage of stereoelectronic and strain effects in what is then an apparently dissociative process. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Drohat AC, Jagadeesh J, Ferguson E, Stivers JT. 1999.

Since a virus needs to amplify its genetic information before it can take over the infected cell and make only viral proteins and its genetic information, it has two possible options.<\/p>\n\n<p>DNA viruses can use the cells replication and transcription machinery to make copies and express proteins. RNA viruses either have to use a reverse transcriptase to make DNA from its RNA genome to go on like the DNA viruses. Or they have to have a special, RNA-dependent (works only on RNA templates) RNA-polymerase (our RNA polymerase are all DNA-dependent and work only on DNA templates) to make more copies of their genome. Our DNA polymerases are dependent on DNA, the same is true for our RNA polymerases. So if the virus is not encoding (and actually bringing a few molecules with it in the virus) of the RT-polymerase or the special RNA-dependent RNA polymerase it will not be able to spread.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using ribonucleotide reductases would theoretically be possible, but it is not the way nature went. And since a cell contains huge amounts of RNA, I doubt this would be a feasible way, as the enzyme would reduce all RNA. And later on the new viruses also needs new (not reduced RNA) to be packaged into new viruses. This would also be problematic.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19595,"question_id":19590,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1405072859},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f7489ce1ad16353c71abba83ae8be4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4747,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4747/user137","reputation":3897,"display_name":"user137","accept_rate":78},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1405434601,"creation_date":1405434601,"body":"<p>I don't know if this is helpful in the context of moving from RNA to DNA world, but I do know that certain mutations to T7 RNA polymerase will allow that enzyme to use 2' deoxy nucleotides in addition to the normal ribonucleotides.

In successive days different cars will come and go, front yards will get overgrown and trimmed, etc, but these details get mixed in with what you saw the first few days into a blurrier and blurrier sort of average. Trillions of impressions from hundreds of days take up very little more capacity than the first day did, and still tell you what you need to know about the route. <\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine that there's a particular green car of common make and model, that was parked in front of a certain house about 3/4 of the time for the first hundred days you walked the route.

They are more expensive but in the long run it will save money since you don't have to repeat experiments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regarding your leaking pipettes: The pipettes contain rubber rings and teflon seals in the inside which have to be replaced from time to time. The image below shows how (parts C and D), the ring can be purchased from Gilson. If you don't know how to do this work (and have no technician who does) you can also send in the pipettes for service. This costs a bit of money, but is ways better than to use unreliable, leaky pipettes. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DGdMk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>And don't worry, Gilson pipettes are pretty good.

One gene can give rise to multiple protein sequences. Which one is produced at any one time can depend on a multitude of factors ranging from pure chance, through environmental conditions to the cell type where the gene is expressed.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Genes can be present on both strands of DNA and a gene on the + strand can overlap with a gene on the - strand. In some cases they can even overlap on the same strand (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_gene\" rel=\"nofollow\">nested genes<\/a>).

A given gene can have dozens or hundreds of ATG codons, how can you know which one is used as a START codon? <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The process of identifying the parts of the genome that get translated into protein is not trivial. It is the subject of countless PhD theses, mine for example. There are many programs (gene predictors) that are designed specifically to detect genes in genomic sequences. Having spent many years working with them I can assure you that they're not something you can just whip up one afternoon. They tend to involve very complex models of coding vs. non-coding sequences and are way more sophisticated than simply looking for START and STOP codons.

And, as computers and\n  cellphones (which train our eyes to focus on short distances) play an\n  ever-increasing role in our lives, we can only expect that this number\n  will grow. One study in the United States highlights the rising rates\n  of nearsightedness. These researchers found that in the early 1970\u2019s,\n  approximately 25 percent of Americans between the ages of 12 and 54\n  were nearsighted, but thirty years later that number had skyrocketed\n  to 42 percent. While it\u2019s been clear that genetics play an important\n  role in nearsightedness, until this month relatively little was known\n  about which genes are involved. Two large studies on nearsightedness,\n  however, have recently shed light on the subject. One of these studies\n  was conducted by the 23andMe research team under the leadership of Amy\n  Kiefer and Nick Eriksson. <\/p>\n  \n  <p>Read more at\n  <a href=\"http://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/citizen-scientists-look-into-nearsightedness/#ijOHfuvePBSFOm4A.99\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/citizen-scientists-look-into-nearsightedness/#ijOHfuvePBSFOm4A.99<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Which types of eye disease are inherited?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic factors play a role in many kinds of eye disease, including those diseases that are the leading cause of blindness among infants, children and adults.<\/p>\n\n<p>More than 60 percent of cases of blindness among infants are caused by inherited eye diseases such as congenital (present at birth) cataracts, congenital glaucoma, retinal degeneration, optic atrophy and eye malformations. Up to 40% of patients with certain types of strabismus (ocular misalignment) have a family history of the disease and efforts are currently under way to identify the responsible genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>In adults, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are two of the leading causes of blindness, and both appear to be inherited in a large portion of cases. Researchers have mapped several genes for glaucoma and are starting to identify genes involved in macular degeneration. They also are making very significant progress in identifying the genes that cause retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease of the retina that causes night blindness and gradual vision loss.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can common vision problems be inherited?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Genetics also play a role in vision problems that occur in otherwise healthy eyes. Genetic ophthalmologic researchers now have evidence that the most common vision problems among children and adults are genetically determined. The list includes strabismus (cross-eyes), amblyopia (lazy eye) and refraction errors such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can inherited eye diseases be corrected if an early diagnosis is made?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>YES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/inherited_eye_disease/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/inherited_eye_disease/default.aspx<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058260/table/T1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table<\/a> gives a better insight on Causes of Myopia:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/F6Af5.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> <\/p>\n","answer_id":19591,"question_id":19587,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1405064814}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19587/are-common-eye-defects-inherited","last_activity_date":1405342642,"creation_date":1405033338,"answer_count":1,"title":"Are common eye defects inherited?","body":"<p>If one parent is nearsighted and the other is farsighted.\nOne parent developed nearsightedness later in life, while the other was born farsighted and they are both the first ones in their family to have any sort of eye problems.\nIs there a possibility of their children having a perfect vision since both their conditions are the result of a recessive gene and can the probability of inheriting one over the other be assessed?<\/p>\n","question_id":19587,"tags":["eyes"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":169,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1405342639},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e1f5e819bdf45f6ba96876514c9aa1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5584,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5584/user3175999","reputation":31,"display_name":"user3175999"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3952,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3952/oreotrephes","reputation":4267,"display_name":"Oreotrephes","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"post_id":14966,"edited":false,"creation_date":1392174111,"comment_id":20023,"body":"Interesting question.

It always depends on what you're doing. The e-value is basically a measure of how many such alignments you would expect to find in a database this size by chance. Therefore, e-values greater than 1 mean that you'd expect at least one alignment similar to what you've found by chance alone. <\/p>\n\n<p>As others have stated, the e-value is not a rigorous measure of significance. It depends on<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The length of your alignment.<\/li>\n<li>The alignment's bit-score score (this takes into account amino acid substitution scores based on the matrix being used, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLOSUM\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLOSUM65<\/a> by default).<\/li>\n<li>The size of the database you are searching in.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I have at different times and for different projects used e-values ranging from 10 to 1e-100 or less. You always need to take into account what you are looking for. For example, to run a tBLASTn looking for distant homologs, you'd use a relatively high e-value, say 1e-10 or even 1 or greater depending on the details. For example, the default e-value for <a href=\"http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=tblastn&amp;PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;LINK_LOC=blasthome\" rel=\"nofollow\">ncbi-tBLASTn<\/a> is 10.<\/p>\n\n<p>To find extremely similar sequences in closely related species, you'd use a much smaller one. Say 1e-20 or 1e-50. Normally, you tweak these settings after seeing your results. <\/p>\n\n<p>After running a few hundred blasts, you get the hang of it and you can have a pretty good estimate of the e-value cutoff you want to use. Until you get that experience, you will have to use trial and error. Just remember that the conclusions you can draw from your data will be heavily influenced by that e-value. Don't try to publish something claiming you've found a homolog if the supporting BLAST hit has an e-value of 45 for example. <\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, when looking at BLAST out files, I check the e-value, the alignment's length (as a percentage of the query), the alignment's %id score and the bit score itself.

In female carriers, extreme lyonization may lead to low clotting factor levels. We studied the effect of heterozygous hemophilia carriership on the occurrence of bleeding symptoms. A postal survey was performed among most of the women who were tested for carriership of hemophilia in the Netherlands before 2001. The questionnaire included items on personal characteristics, characteristics of hemophilia in the affected family members, and carrier testing and history of bleeding problems such as bleeding after tooth extraction, bleeding after tonsillectomy, and other operations. Information on clotting factor levels was obtained from the hospital charts. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of carrier status and clotting factor levels with the occurrence of hemorrhagic events. In 2004, 766 questionnaires were sent, and 546 women responded (80%). Of these, 274 were carriers of hemophilia A or B. The median clotting factor level of carriers was 0.60 IU/mL (range, 0.05-2.19 IU/mL) compared with 1.02 IU/mL (range, 0.45-3.28 IU/mL) in noncarriers. Clotting factor levels from 0.60 to 0.05 IU/mL were increasingly associated with prolonged bleeding from small wounds and prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, and operations. Carriers of hemophilia bleed more than other women, especially after medical interventions. Our findings suggest that not only clotting factor levels at the extreme of the distribution, resembling mild hemophilia, but also mildly reduced clotting factor levels between 0.41 and 0.60 IU/mL are associated with bleeding.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Bimler, D &amp; Kirkland, J (2009) Colour-space distortion in women who are heterozygous for colour deficiency.

Thanks"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1404949425,"creation_date":1404948145,"body":"<p>Indeed natural selection decrease variability and therefore decrease information and mutation recreate this information. You can think of a bunch of pens of different colors. If you select \nfor the red pens you will decrease the variability in pen colors as the other colors will slowly disappear. If you allow for mutation to occur you will recreate blue and black and purple and yellow pens to occur again in your population of pens.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it an accurate statement that less variability means less total information?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, less variability means less information. Information is a concept that increases as predictability decreases. If no variability exist, you can predict at 100% what allele a given individual is carrying. You may want to have a look to shannon's theory of information <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> on Khan academy. Note: this has not much to do with biology but it has to the mathematical definition has to do with mathematics, probability and computer science.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any known mechanisms besides mutation that replenish the variability in alleles?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>No, there is nothing else than mutations that creates new alleles. \"Mutation\" means any kind of structural change of DNA. So by definition any change in the DNA is due to mutations, therefore only mutations creates new alleles. Note: that some people may use the word mutation in a more narrow sense including some kind of DNA change such as indels but excluding chromosome rearrangement for example. I used here the word mutation in the broad sense.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Segregation and Recombination<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Two other concepts may interest you though: Segregation (See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mendelian inheritance<\/a>) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover\" rel=\"nofollow\">recombination<\/a>(also called crossing over).<\/p>\n\n<p>For example if 2 individuals $AB$ (Allele $A$ on one chromosome and allele $B$ on the other chromosome) reproduce they can create the individuals $AA$, $AB$ or $BB$ thanks to segregation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two Genes set on chromosomes and if two genes are on the same chromosome, one might think that these two genes cannot segregate independently one from the other, they are linked! For example imagine an individual has the alleles $A_1$ and $B_1$ on two loci of one chromsome and alleles $A_2$ and $B_2$ on the two same loci but of the homologous chromosome. If this individual transmit the allele $A_2$ it must necessarily transmit the allele $B_2$ and can't transmit $B_1$ if recombination does not occur. But recombination does occur and allows for partially independent segregation of these two genes.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will find more information about these two concepts on wikipedia. I don't want to go too much into details but in short <em>these processes can in some conditions increase the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenotypic<\/a> variance but in any case these phenomenon do not create new alleles. New alleles are created by mutations only.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can 2 individuals carry as much genetic information than today's world population?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>No! As a very simple argument, two individuals can only have 4 different alleles. But we know several <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">loci<\/a> (sing: locus, position on a chromosome) where there exist more than 4 different alleles. Therefore, mutations must have happened at some time.<\/p>\n\n<p>And only to enjoy some further arguments: if these two individuals had together 4 alleles at all loci, it would be extraordinary unlikely that their variation would have remained in today's population. Let's imagine two <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity#Heterozygous\" rel=\"nofollow\">heterozygote<\/a> (=who has two different alleles on their two chromosomes for a given locus) individuals are $AB$ and $CD$ that have two offsprings. The probability that their 4 alleles are present in the two offsprings is $1/4$. I don't when Adam and Eve were supposed to exist but it very sound like their variability would have not been maintained through times. This random process which diminish variability is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic drift<\/a>. To be a bit more accurate, in a population that do not change in size, the expected loss of alleles due to genetic drift at each generation $1/2N$, where $N$ is the population size. So the bigger is the population size, the lower is the loss of alleles due to genetic drift. In the above example $N=2$ and therefore the expected loss is $1/4$.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I don't know that much about meiosis, but isn't there a very limited number of alleles that could be passed on by the parents?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, as said above, one individual can only have two alleles at a given loci and can therefore not transmit more than two different alleles.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Without a population to start with, wouldn't the lineage eventually turn into clones of each other[..]?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, because in absence of mutations (and in absence of different special types of selection such as overdominance) the variability is slowly lost due to the randomness of segregation.

Milk is a <em>product<\/em> that is constructed in the mammary glands, and the cells are selective about the output. Keep in mind, however, that it is <strong>by no means<\/strong> <em>sterile<\/em>.

Of the 121 outbreaks, 60% of them were from unpasturized products, with a ~2 to 1 split between milk and cheese. All of them were caused by bacteria (addressing the idea that it might be a viral pathogen that wouldn't have been deactivated anyway).<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is though that many states prohibit the sale of raw milk products, and its relatively rare.

If you have one without the other trees don't tend to live that long. Cold climates make growth\nharder for each individual, yet hot and moist climates tend to help trees grow easier, but also die easier. Think of the amazon. It is one of the richest forests in the world, yet the growth of bacteria and high competition in the areas of the equator make life a lot harder for the longest living and slowest growing species.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the vast majority of the longest-living trees are located in California, or other regions of the same latitude!\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other species and the life around it/Its Ecosystem<\/strong>: Individual trees tend to be less likely to be destroyed by a fire, as they are less likely to catch fire. At some instances, forest trees or dried-out grass can catch fire and pass it on to other individuals.\nMicrobes and bugs found in some parts of the world are known to their abilities to destroy trees!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Current size of the tree<\/strong>: Larger trees are generally less likely to die of causes like drought or damage to their trunks, as they have greatly extensive nets of roots and thick trunks and thus are able to, even partly, recover these incidences. <\/p>\n\n<p>If a rockfall for example causes damage to one side of the tree, some of the brunches will probably die, but the rest of them, that have their own network to the roots, will probably survive.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that luck is involved and if the tree is lucky enough to avoid dying for a certain amount of time, regular fluctuations in the environment do not kill it as they would kill a younger, less robust tree.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Biology of tree species<\/strong>: Debate is held as to whether tree cells have telomeres working the same way as they do in animals. Research published in 2001 suggests that telomeres don't work the same way, as plants developed without telomeres after six generations continue living and growing without problems. But even if they do use telomeres, they may use them in a different way. This is an area where research is still being conducted, though, and you may find controversies in the bibliography!\nFor example in the paper \"<em>Analysis of telomere length and telomerase activity in tree species of various life-spans, and with age in the bristlecone pine Pinus longaeva\"\nBarry E.

Planting an olive tree in the amazon is a great way of making sure it will not survive! Some trees are better at surviving in a certain climate (even if it is at your own garden) simply because they have evolved to live there. <\/p>\n\n<p>That means that the trees probably don't have a defined lifetime in general, but the life expectancy is defined in each environment, depending on the circumstances!<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that species we currently think of as short-lived can reach get really old: \n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11295506\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11295506<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>What some companies may have done is   try to combine characteristics of individuals through selective breeding - and yes, it works for trees as well!- to match the climate and terrain characteristics found in the certain country or region!

This re-use of the same networks for multiple functions and memories is the same reason we have redundancy in our brain - it's also largely why they are as fuzzy in remembering as they are.

As an important consequence, there is no reason to assume that giving couples a sugary \u201cboost to their self-control energy\u201d (p. 3) will reduce intimate partner violence. Because the glucose model of self-control lacks empirical foundation, it does not qualify as a framework for scientifically based intervention strategies [4].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What is sure, is that hypoglycemia activates sympathetic nervous system:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the neurogenic symptoms of hypoglycemia are largely the result of sympathetic neural, rather than adrenomedullary, activation [5].<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Hypoglycemia increases plasma levels of both epinephrine and norepinephrine. These catechols are released primarily from the adrenal medulla. However, it is well documented that hypoglycemic increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and that both alpha and beta adrenergic activity increase [6].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And this leads to behavioral changes (at least in animals):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Noradrenaline is involved in many different functions, which all are known to affect behaviour profoundly. ... Part of these effects may arise in indirect ways that are by no means specific to aggressive behaviour, however, they are functionally relevant to it. Other effects may affect brain mechanisms specifically involved in aggression. Hormonal catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) appear to be involved in metabolic preparations for the prospective fight; the sympathetic system ensures appropriate cardiovascular reaction, while the CNS noradrenergic system prepares the animal for the prospective fight. ... It appears that neurons bearing postsynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors are responsible for the start and maintenance of aggression, while a situation-dependent fine-tuning is realised through neurons equipped with beta-adrenoceptors [7].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wikipedia contributors, \"Human brain,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_brain&amp;oldid=615456836\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_brain&amp;oldid=615456836<\/a> (accessed July 6, 2014).<\/li>\n<li>Park MJ, Yoo SW, Choe BS, Dantzer R, Freund GG. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21820138\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acute hypoglycemia causes depressive-like behaviors in mice.<\/a> Metab.

This is said to assist them in orientation in their microenvironment but I think it goes a long way to accounting for an ability to detect looming weather fronts. Humans can sometimes 'smell' rain and we can detect gross temperature changes that almost always accompany rain, but to be able to detect humidity and micro-scale temperature changes would give the ants a real advantage in forecasting. After all, not all rainstorms are preceded by a dramatic drop in temperature but probably the majority are preceded by minute step-wise drops in temperature that evidently the ants can sense.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So while I think the building activity may be anecdotal (and probably true for some species) the ability to sense humidity changes and micro-scale temperature changes accounts for their ability to sense rain ahead of time. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ants are very well-studied and it's hard to rule out that one has missed something.

For another, poor nutrition and stress can\n  stunt height growth, and higher calorie diets have been associated\n  with increased height.

This answer is not necessarily optimisation for annealing but checking some basics and potential solutions. In my work I had to do a lot of site directed mutagenesis and genotyping and there are some important rules you have to follow in your primer design. First try to keep your primer length between 25-30 for sequencing (at least thats what I do) and for site-directed mutagenesis between 25-45 since anything above 45 bases increases the likelihood of secondary structure formation. Primer melting temperature (Tm) should be >=78 oC (Tm= 81.5 + 0.41(%GC)-675/N [with N being primer length in bases]). Also primers should have a minimum CG content of 40% and should ideally start and end with a C or G. So check your primer CG% since if its too high then it will make a few problems including increased Tm and possibility of primer-dimer formation due to CG triple hydrogen binding. This document has some nice information (<a href=\"http://www.genomics.agilent.com/files/Manual/210518.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.genomics.agilent.com/files/Manual/210518.pdf<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>In my opinion if all else fails and you are still struggling with your primers, then re-design a new primer set, if possible. Now getting back to the annealing temperature issue, in my experience for cDNA, annealing temp of 50 oC works best and for genomic DNA, annealing temp of 55 oC works best, which is about the range most people work with and I have so far had no problems. I'm more than happy to share my genomic DNA PCR cycle information with you if you wish through an edit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!<\/p>\n","answer_id":17350,"question_id":3181,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3181/optimization-of-annealing-temperature","last_activity_date":1405035017,"creation_date":1345035253,"answer_count":1,"title":"Optimization of annealing temperature","body":"<p>I am trying to optimize annealing temperature for some primer pairs.

It depends on the protein! proteins can either be cytoplasmic, nuclear, transmembrane or secretory. Cytoplasmic proteins (as far as I know) get released to the cytoplasm after they have been folded correctly (through chaperones) and gone through the quality control mechanism. Nuclear proteins get transported through the nuclear pores, across the nuclear envelope through chaperones. Now for the transmembrane or secretory proteins, the fate of these proteins and where they go is decided by the ER (but obviously the information is there in the protein sequence). Transmembrane proteins have a signalling peptide and a transmembrane domain signal anchor sequence which ER recognises and through fancy looping and elongation across the ER membrane, the proteins is further translated by the ribosomes and eventually gets translocated to the cell membrane. There is very very nice nature review paper (Rapoport, 2007) about this and if you look at Figure 5, you will get a good ideas as to what goes on. For the secretory protein again its the interaction of the protein sequence with the ER membrane, helped with the ribosomes (in fact the groves in the ribosomes are key for making these fancy looping happen as the protein residues in ribosomes interact with peptide residues (amino acids) that are being produced on the fly), that processes it and sends it for secretion (Rapoport, 2007) and trans-golgi network is also important in the secretion process (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1424219/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1424219/<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully these information would provide you with some hints.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17342,"question_id":17331,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17331/in-the-endomembrane-system-after-a-protein-leaves-the-rough-er-where-does-it-g","last_activity_date":1405020606,"creation_date":1399816714,"answer_count":1,"title":"In the endomembrane system, after a protein leaves the rough ER, where does it go?","body":"<p>It can either go to the smooth ER then to the Golgi or it can go directly to the Golgi, right?

But then the fingers and feet also have a high density of skin receptors, and the tactile sense can also be very fine (owing to several different kind of receptors) requiring dense innervation? Certain body movements (especially of hand) are very fine and detailed, requiring a very dense and co-ordinated motor neuron framework.<\/li>\n<li>Is it because the cranial nerves, owing to some developmental restraint or functional trade-off, can only innervate areas close to its place of origin effectively?

There are many many types of cell signalling, anything from RTK (at the cell surface or when its endocytosed), to steroid receptors, which operate on different time scales and produce different results depending on the type of signalling. Also it depends on what you are measuring/defining as a signal/response in lets say \"cell signalling\" because you could define cell signalling response as protein phosphorylation at any point in a signalling cascade or it could be the transcriptional activation itself (consider the MAPK pathway in Drosophila, at which point do you consider a response is produced? when Raf is activated? or when transcription factors such as pointed bind to their ETS binding site and start to transcribe as measured by luciferase? as you can tell the time difference between the two is quite large, well as far as I know after RTK activation in Drosophila it takes ERK 20 minutes just to translocate to the nucleus).

The flight muscles of the tsetse fly (<em>Glossina morsitans<\/em>) have been observed to grow at a faster rate when subjected to enforced exercise <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.1051500205/abstract\">(Anderson and Finlayson, 1976)<\/a>. Also larger mandibular adductor muscles (which power the feeding apparatus), and associated head capsule have been noted for caterpillars and grasshoppers feeding on particularly hard grasses <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/1696716\">(Bernays, 1986)<\/a>. However these examples occur immediately post-eclosion (i.e. after emergence as adults), and during immature stages respectively. Insect muscle typically grows during larval/nymphal (immature) stages, and often for a brief period at the start of adulthood - known as the teneral period. During immature stages, insects typically have a flexible membrane to allow for tissue growth and expansion, this can also be the case during the teneral period, before the inflexible exoskeleton has fully hardened. However at full maturity, insect growth is limited by the rigidity of their exoskeleton.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as excessive exercise is concerned, that some insects may be weakened permanently may be more to do with the fact that their life strategy is different to ours. Due to the vast number of offspring per adult, and subsequent low survival chance of any given individual, there could be an evolutionary advantage for individuals pushing themselves to possibly deadly extremes. This could lead to many deaths, whilst retaining a viable population and thus accelerate the emergence of a population of fitter individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Anderson, M. &amp; Finlayson, L.H., 1976.

Read lots of articles, still makes no sense to me] and hydrostatic pressure of the capillary... Thus there would be a net influx of interstitial fluid in the very ending part of the capillary, toward the venous side...<\/p>\n\n<p>I say interstitial fluid, because it's not lymph yet since the interstitial fluid hasn't yet entered the adjacent lymph capillaries... if the interstitial fluid entered the lymph capillary then it would be stuck there, the mechanism of this one way flow is the junctions between the endothelial cells in these blind ended lymph capillary... These junctions which only opens up gaps between these endothelial cells when the interstitial pressure outside the lymph capillaries is higher than pressure inside the lymph capillaries... <\/p>\n\n<p>The lymph then goes forward through lymphatic vessels/nodes because external pressure (pulsing of adjacent artery, contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle, changes in thoracic pressuring during breathing, etc) and there is little back flow because of valves (just like venous valves which prevent back flow in the low pressure venous system)... Ultimately the lymph returns by either thoracic duct (in the angle between left subclavian and left jugular vein) or right lymphatic duct  (in the angle between right subclavian and right jugular vein)...<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some sweet review articles from University of Bergen, Norway that go much more in depth on the physiology of interstitial fluid...\nHere is one of their more recent review articles:\n<a href=\"http://m.physrev.physiology.org/content/92/3/1005\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.physrev.physiology.org/content/92/3/1005<\/a> it's free<\/p>\n\n<p>IN SUMMARY: the starling forces bring interstitial fluid into the blood (the \"peripheral part\" right after the capillary)... The thoracic and right lymphatic duct drain lymph into the blood (I'm assuming this does not apply by your definition of peripheral, since this venous blood is about to be drained into the right atrium and is destined for the lungs)...<\/p>\n\n<p>P.S. aqueous humor (in the eye), endolymph (cochlea aka inner ear) and CSF are also absorbed back into the blood... Also the brain has an interstitial fluid that is different from the CSF found in the subarachnoid spce of the meninges, i actually don't know how that drains...

When such a fish is transferred into air we imagine that it can no longer breathe. However fish do in fact obtain a significant proportion of their oxygen through their skin. Furthermore, as long as the gills remain moist it should be possible to obtain some oxygen by direct diffusion from the air into the layer of water surrounding the gills.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to Rombough PJ (1998) Partitioning of oxygen uptake between the gills and skin in fish larvae: a novel method for estimating cutaneous oxygen uptake. J Expt. Biol. 201: 1763 - 1769<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Adults of water-breathing fish typically obtain 10\u201320 % of their oxygen across the skin, but values as high as 30 % have been reported (Feder and Burggren, 1985).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The cited paper is: Feder, M.E. and Burggren WW (1985) Cutaneous gas exchange in vertebrates: design, patterns, control and implications. Biol. Rev. 60: 1-45.

Table 2 of Feder &amp; Burggren presents data acomparing the contribution of skin and gills for various air-breathing fish in water and in air. In the eel this goes from (skin/gills) 12%/88% in water to 33%/67% in air at 15 &deg;C.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know if stone-fish are designated as 'air-breathing' but it is clear that as long as they are in a moist environment many fish can obtain significant amounts of oxygen from the surrounding air. @Chris suggests that the fish may \"turn down their metabolism\" under these circumstances.

In other words, The number of offspring <strong>is<\/strong> related to fitness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Various definitions of fitness exist depending on the model you want to use but whatever is the model you want to use the number of offspring is always related to fitness. For the purpose of a beginner in evolutionary biology, it is probably enough to assume that the number of offsprings that managed to survive to some adult age and fitness are actually the exact same thing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Answer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Darwin's theory of evolution?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>What do you call Darwin's theory of evolution? Do you mean the theory of evolution as it was formulated by Charles Darwin at its time or do you mean the current theory of evolution? Charles Darwin never used the word fitness (if I am not mistaken), so I will talk about the modern theory of evolution only.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Generalities<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>For most of the purpose it is enough to consider fitness as being the expected number of offsprings that manage to survive to some adult age of an individual given its environment and its genotype. The word \"expected\" used above refers to the first statistical moment (mean) of the random variable which is the number of offspring of an individual given its genotype and its environment. In other words, <strong>the number of offsprings is \"related\" to fitness<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Absolute versus Relative fitness<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>In general, we talk about absolute and relative fitness, where the absolute fitness of an individual is its number of offsprings and the relative fitness of an individual is its absolute fitness divided by either the mean fitness of the population or more often divided by the absolute fitness of the fittest individual in the population.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Fitness is a function of fecundity and survival<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>To be a bit more accurate, fitness is a function of both age-specific survival and age-specific fecundity. A very good measure of fitness is given be the elements of leading eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix $L$ in $\\overrightarrow n_{t+1} = L \\overrightarrow n_t $ where $\\overrightarrow n_t$ is a vector that gives the number of individuals of a given genotype of each age living at time $t$. $\\overrightarrow n_t = (n_{1t}, n_{2t}, \u2026, n_{nt})^T$, where $T$ indicates transpose and $n_{xt}$ is the number of individuals of age classe $x$ at time $t$.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Definitions of fitness slightly varies depending on the model you want to use<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>One may want to use an even more complex definitions of fitness, typically when using models that apply to species that have an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_of_generations\" rel=\"nofollow\">alternation of generation<\/a>. Or when considering, genotypes that have different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norms_of_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">norms of reactions<\/a> and considering a changing environment through time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, whatever is the model you want to apply, fitness is always related to the expected number of offsprings. It would be wrong though to reduce fitness to the expected number of offsprings only, because a more complex definition might be necessary in some special cases. In any case, fitness is always an index of how much will a variant spread in a population and is therefore closely linked to the number of offsprings.<\/p>\n","answer_id":17301,"question_id":17288,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1404713942},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889548c1e8387b3d381853dee5212cfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3632,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3632/shigeta","reputation":22684,"display_name":"shigeta","accept_rate":86},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1400139868,"creation_date":1400139868,"body":"<p>It is definitely in line with Darwin's theory.

The presence of IPTG ensures that repressor will bind at neither site.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Supplementary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think that I understand why you are confused now. Your picture of the way this works is based on the idea that the repressor is locked on to the operator until an inducer such as IPTG comes along. In fact there is an equilibrium between bound and unbound:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>repressor/operator &lt;=> repressor + operator<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>and, in the brief periods when the repressor isn't bound, the E. coli RNA polymerase can bind and transcribe the operon. This is referred to as 'escape synthesis' and it is generally assumed that it is functionally relevant in ensuring that there are low levels of lac permease expression at all times so that lactose can be taken up. If this wasn't the case, how would the natural inducer (a derivative of lactose) ever be able to induce the lac operon?<\/p>\n\n<p>In protein expression systems it is generally considered desirable to keep escape synthesis of the foreign protein to a minimum so that there is no selection acting on the gene to negate any deleterious effects of its expression. The use of T7 polymerase as an intermediate level of regulation helps to achieve this. Even if there is a low level of escape synthesis of T7 polymerase, the concentration of T7 polymerase will be so low in the uninduced state (compared to the endogenous RNA polymerase) that the amount of escape synthesis of the target protein due to T7 polymerase gaining productive access to the T7 promoter on the plasmid will be negligible.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2008/02/repression-of-lac-operon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more here.<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":19487,"question_id":19485,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1404583091}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19485/a-question-about-iptg-induction","last_activity_date":1404583091,"creation_date":1404503042,"answer_count":1,"title":"A question about IPTG induction","body":"<p>I have found the information: `In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor binds to the operator sequence on DNA and bends the DNA by 40 degrees.
