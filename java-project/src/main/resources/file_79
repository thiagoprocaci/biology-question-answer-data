It's an illustration of the \"trombone model\" of DNA replication. The darker blue molecule is helicase, it unwinds the DNA and facilitates translocation (this is an ATP dependent process). The dark purple molecules are DNA polymerase, they catalyze DNA strand synthesis (an NTP dependent process) using an ssDNA template and 3'-OH primer (the primer:template junction). The green circular molecules are sliding clamps, they increase the processivity of DNA polymerase. The light purple molecule is the sliding clamp loader, unsurprisingly it loads the sliding clamp onto the DNA (ATP dependent). The light blue molecule is a flexible linker that connects everything together. The other green molecule (the one that contacts helicase) is primase, it synthesizes RNA primers (which contains the 3'-OH initially used by DNA polymerase). <\/p>\n\n<p>Certainly intermolecular forces play a significant role in this (and every) biochemical process, but I'm not really sure what you're talking about when you're describing electric forces and Brownian motion.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Anyways, the answer to your question is no, Okazaki fragments do not have a fixed length. DNA synthesis, as mentioned above, occurs only by adding NTPs to a 3'-OH primer. Thus the length of Okazaki fragments is dependent on the spacing between primers on the lagging strand. This is dependent on <strong>when<\/strong> primase binds which in turn is dependent on primase concentration as well as its binding affinity with DNA and other replication fork proteins (especially helicase). High concentration and/or high affinity leads to a higher binding frequency and therefore shorter Okazaki fragments. The opposite is true for low concentration and/or low affinity. Note that most (or all?) primases have some degree of sequence specificity which means that specific DNA motifs will increase binding affinity. For example, <em>Escherichia coli<\/em> primase (DnaG) recognizes the trimer GTA.<\/p>\n\n<p>This process also requires some degree of coordination between leading and lagging strand synthesis. Primer synthesis and DNA polymerase recycling on the lagging strand is much slower than the continuous synthesis on the leading strand. It has been suggested that primase acts as a \"molecular brake\" by halting the replication fork during primer synthesis to prevent the leading strand polymerase from rapidly outpacing those on the lagging strand (Lee JB, Hite RK, Hamdan SM, Xie XS, Richardson CC, van Oijen AM. 2006. DNA primase actas as a molecular brake in DNA replication.

Primarily its electronegativity, as that determines its stability, ability to accept and donate electrons, protons, and its ease of acquisition given plentiful amounts in the environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Molecular Oxygen is comparatively stable to a lot of di-atomic molecules, and comparatively reactive to others. It's in the butter zone for the act of being the terminal acceptor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's think about Fluoride: Almost all of it is bound up in rocks with other elements. It's not available everywhere. It might be an alright candidate if we could eat rocks, but it also replaces minerals in our bones and teeth. Yes, you're familiar with this - but too much leads to fluorosis - where too much of the calcium compound is replaced, and it ends up making the bones and teeth much <strong>weaker<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alright, let's think about Nitrogen - Very stable, pretty good electronegativity, abundant... but a little <em>too<\/em> stable. Yup, it's a gas, it's everywhere, and we can't use a lick of it. It's so stable that it's basically inert. The only reason rhizomes and other beneficial bacteria can use it is because they're in a controlled environment away from oxygen with significantly different biochemical processes which produce much less energy (and probably wouldn't be able to support large multicellular organisms that are as active as we are). So, Nitrogen is out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carbon? Nope, as an ion it's dangerously reactive, and as anything else it's too stable. Plus, we're carbon-based! If we used carbon as the terminal acceptor then the proteins handling the electrons would have to be even more exotic and filled with other elements to prevent them accidentally gobbling up the electron and becoming useless.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sulfur? Not electronegative enough for human purposes, unfortunately. It wouldn't act as a terminal acceptor unless our bodies seriously oxidized it; and any oxidized molecules floating around would be <em>more<\/em> dangerous than molecular oxygen floating around. Plus most sulfur is bound to minerals as well - not abundant unless you're in the ocean. <\/p>\n\n<p>Oxygen is both incredibly abundant and easy to perform the chemistry with. More reactive molecules are usually not abundant and tied up in the Earth's crust and could be <em>more dangerous<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Less reactive molecules tend to be so non-reactive that we can't do anything with them, and if we could force them into a state where they would be reactive they tend to be violently reactive or require very specific environments that we can't reproduce on a scale necessary to be as mobile as we are.<\/p>\n\n<p>Oxygen is not perfect, but it's a good fit.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does it even require an \"acceptor\" to accept the electrons and hydrogen ions?

They also adapt to cell culture conditions after several hundred passages in culture. I've cultured both HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. The HepG2 are a hepatocellular carcinoma line and grow fine in culture, while the primary hepatocytes don't really grow in culture and only live for a few days after you extract them from a mouse. We were doing gene transfer assays with both sets of cells. The quickly dividing HepG2 cells were easy to transform using PEI, and while primary hepatocytes could be transformed with PEI, they worked better with calcium phosphate, probably because it was less toxic. I noticed that HepG2 cells were smaller than primary hepatocytes, and the primaries were far more fragile, we could run HepG2 through a peristaltic pump with no problems, but had to handle all the primary cells by hand. <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as cost goes, tissue culture is almost always cheaper. You can make a bottle of media for a few dollars worth of material and use it for several passages. The cost of running an incubator and biosafety cabinet are also minimal. So unless you're doing something unusual, cell culture is affordable. However, it's an incomplete model at best. Trying to create whole tissues in the lab counts as unusual.<\/p>\n\n<p>Doing work with animals is far more accurate than cell culture, but much more expensive. Our mice are cheap, but still cost about a dollar each, and about 20 cents a day for housing. A typical biodistribution experiment will use 3 mice per time point and 8 - 10 time points, so 24 to 30 mice assuming no mistakes during dosing. On top of that, doing animal work has a lot more bureaucracy involved, with animal use protocols and approvals and inspections.<\/p>\n\n<p>The question about whether to use animal models vs cell culture comes down to what you're trying to accomplish. If you're studying gene regulation or protein interactions, cell culture usually works better because it's more amenable to gene transfer and allows you to use techniques like fluorescent fusion proteins and bioconjugation. If you're studying drug metabolism and toxicity you should use whole animals because the interactions between metabolites and specific tissues are hard to reproduce in cell culture. In some far off future we may be able to totally replace animal models with cell culture or even computer models, but we're not even close.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20433,"question_id":20420,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20420/what-are-the-main-differences-between-lab-grown-tissues-and-natural-tissues-from","last_activity_date":1407852886,"creation_date":1407807806,"answer_count":1,"title":"What are the main differences between lab-grown tissues and natural tissues from living animals?","body":"<p>What are the main differences between lab-grown tissues and natural tissues from living animals?<\/p>\n\n<p>Using a biologist's classic \"<em>structure (<strong>anatomy<\/strong>) and function (<strong>physiology<\/strong>)<\/em>\" idea, I thought about the followings:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Structure:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>It might be difficult to recreate the composition of different tissues / cells in living things precisely with artificial methods.<\/em> This may lead to bad results when the tissue is used for tests of medicines and cosmetics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Function:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cells might not function and produce as expected (or is harder to make them function) in artificial compositions, as cells need strictly regulated environments to function correctly.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Also, I think using artificial tissues for drug tests helps researchers to avoid ethical issues which may arise if they use living animals instead.

Day length affects more than just how long the periods of light and dark are. Let's assume a very slow rotation, and a very long day, maybe 1 month light, 1 month dark. The light side would get much warmer while the dark side would get much cooler. At the border between light and dark sides, you'd expect to see powerful storms as the hot moist expanding air moved into the cooler side and had to lose moisture. Any life on a planet like this would have to adapt to surviving in both hotter and cooler temperatures. We can take this to an even worse extreme and look at a planet like uranus. Uranus's axis is tilted at 97.7 degrees, so even though it rotates, the day/night cycle is controlled by it's rotation around the sun. If the earth were tilted like this, then we would 6 months of light followed by 6 months of darkness. Life would either have to keep moving to stay in the moving temperate twilight zones or adapt to hibernate.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we assumed a shorter day/night cycle, I think the changes would be less significant. Lets say we had a 4 hour day. ( There has to be a speed where things get thrown off the planet, but I don't think 4 hours per day is fast enough ) A 4 hour day would have 2 hours of light with 2 hours of dark. My guess is that circadian rhythms would be less important. Temperature changes from light to dark would be less significant than currently. <\/p>\n\n<p>It's an interesting thing to think about because the Earth's day is slowly getting longer as the moon exerts a tidal force on our planet, slowing our rotation and escaping further into space, but this change is so slow I doubt it will ever become a problem for humans.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20411,"question_id":16973,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16973/how-would-a-different-solar-day-affect-evolution","last_activity_date":1407784807,"creation_date":1398718729,"answer_count":1,"title":"How would a different solar day affect evolution?","body":"<p>Has anyone theorized how evolution would be affected by a different length of solar day, what were the conclusions?<\/p>\n\n<p>The thought came from thinking about life on other planets/moons, but I'm initially thinking about it from the frame of \"How would life on earth and humans specifically have evolved (or if they would have) if a day were 12 hours or 48 hours?<\/p>\n\n<p>I imagine the actual effects on evolution and lifestyle would be extensive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: this question <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/16642/how-would-the-human-body-adjust-to-sleep-times-if-we-were-to-live-in-a-place-wit\">How would the human body adjust to sleep times if we were to live in a place with different day lengths?<\/a> is slightly related, but just to clarify I'm intersted in effect on evolution, not adaptation if an indivdual moved between planets.<\/p>\n","question_id":16973,"tags":["evolution","circadian-rhythms"],"score":1,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":140,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ecfef9d2f332df4085bf80c5ffc3217?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8693,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8693/tim","reputation":131,"display_name":"Tim"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11ecb2130d870caa97f33b9e9e658e19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":4109,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4109/resonating","reputation":3125,"display_name":"Resonating"},"score":1,"post_id":20392,"edited":false,"creation_date":1407789246,"comment_id":30623,"body":"It seems arbitrary to you because it is arbitrary.

In the second step the thioester formed between the enzyme and the G3P is attacked by a molecule of inorganic phosphate to form 1,3-BPG. This step is only made possible by splitting the very energy rich thioester bond. So for this reaction to happen you need both steps, as the formation of an energy rich phosphate ester bond would otherwise not happen.

No. Many species in <em>Cryptocarya<\/em> group of Lauraceae have microsporangia that have fused such that they have only two microsporangia instead of the typical four (Rohwer et al. 2014). I interpret their description as saying that the microsporangia within a theca but it's not clearly stated as such.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Within the Magnoliidae, one pollen sac of a theca is lost is some taxa <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1989.tb01709.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Endress et al. 2008).<\/a> Evolutionarily, the Hamamelidaceae have reduced the number of pollen sacs from two to one (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00936917\" rel=\"nofollow\">Endress 1989<\/a>). I could not find examples of plants with more than two microsporangia per theca.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why do most plants have two pollen sacs per theca?  It's probably a result of the evolutionary history of plants in general because it is so common. Even those that have only a single pollen sac seems to start out developmentally with two.  It's probably due to the underlying genetics.<\/p>\n\n<p>The genetics of floral development is complex but being slowly teased apart. The overall development of floral patterns is set by a group of developmental or regulatory$^1$ genes called MADS genes.  Collectively, the MADS genes (along with other regulatory genes) control the overall organization of the flower structure. For example, MADS genes determine the arrangement of floral whorls from sepals (outermost whorl) to petals to stamens to carpals (innermost whorl). Changes in use or timing of the MADS genes can contribute to different types of floral morphology, such as the loss of sepals or big, showy sepals but no petals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of these same MADS genes contribute to the formation of the stamen structure. The review by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC160355/pdf/051217.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goldberg et al. (1993)<\/a> gives a thorough but now dated review of the developmental genes that control anther development. The figure below (their figure 3) gives a nice overview of the stages that lead to development of the theca with two microsporangia and ultimately to the final stage of fertilization. Even more specific, <a href=\"http://www.plantcell.org/content/3/8/749.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bowman et al. (1991)<\/a> show that <em>AGAMOUS<\/em> is one regulatory gene that is active during the development of the theca and microsporangia.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/K4sLB.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 from Goldberg et al.\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I can't speak in detail about how regulatory genes work in flowers (I know a bit more about regulatory genes in animal development, especially from an evolutionary developmental perspective). In animals, regulatory genes often work by concentration gradients, both by the concentration of the regulatory gene itself, by the concentration of other regulatory genes, and by the concentration of the regulated genes. This process helps to determine the anterior-posterior axis in animals with bilateral symmetry, as well as the left and right sides.<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect that floral regulatory genes work in a similar fashion.  Changes in regulatory expression can lead to bilaterally symmetric flowers (think of mint flowers, monkey flowers, etc. See <a href=\"http://jbiol.com/content/8/10/90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hileman and Cubas (2009<\/a> for a good review.). I suspect it is some type of symmetric expression of regulatory genes that leads to the formation of two microsporangia per theca.  Mutations that cause changes in the expression patterns of other regulatory genes can cause the initial expression but subsequent loss of one of the microsporangia, as noted for the Lauraceae and the Hamamelidaceae.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Footnote<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Broadly but simply, regulatory genes are genes such as transcription factors that regulate or control the expression of other genes. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature Cited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Bowman, J.L., et al. 1991.

You can set this up in microsoft excel or libreoffice calc by right clicking the y axis and going to format axis, there should be a logarithmic scale option somewhere depending on the version. <\/p>\n\n<p>After you have the data plotted, the exponential growth phase should appear as a line with positive slope. The logarithmic scale on the Y axis will automatically transform the exponential curve into a straight line. To determine growth rate in terms of generation per hour, you need to get the optical density at time 0, which is the beginning of the exponential phase, and time t, which is just some other time on the exponential phase. Use this equation to determine growth rate: $k =\\frac{log(X_t) - log(X_0)}{0.301t}$<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you know the growth rate, you can determine the generation time with $t_{gen} = \\frac{1}{k}$, which gives time for 1 generation in hours.

Also, if the optical density goes over 2 it won't be as accurate, so dilute the aliquots to make the optical density go below 2.

It was first studied by <strong>Max Wertheimer and Hugo Munsterberg<\/strong> between 1912-16. Wertheimer and Munsterberg found that subjects can perceptually bridge the temporal gap between two consecutive displays, so that a series of static images appear as continuous movement. The discovery of flicker fusion became the perceptual basis for moving pictures, television, and all media based on stroboscopic presentation of stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The minimal frequency at which flickering stimuli appear continuous is called the critical flicker frequency.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><strong>Perceptual factors affecting the critical flicker fusion threshold<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>This critical flicker fusion threshold depends on the stimulus\u2019 <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Luminance (the Ferry-Porter law), <\/li>\n<li>Size (the Granit-Harper law), <\/li>\n<li>Color, <\/li>\n<li>Retinal eccentricity, <\/li>\n<li>Background Luminance, and other factors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Biology Behind it:<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Physiological evidence in humans and monkeys shows that flicker rates\n  above the perceptual critical flicker frequency threshold can\n  nevertheless generate cortical and subcortical visual responses.  Thus\n  the temporal integration underlying flicker fusion does not occur at\n  the level of the retina,  but must take place later in the visual\n  hierarchy. Single-unit recordings in the primary visual cortex of\n  primates suggests that,  for two brief-duration targets presented in\n  close succession, the after-discharge to the first  target interferes\n  with the onset-response to the second target (Macknik, 2006) (see\n  Figure 5). The onset-response to the second flash is absent for\n  inter-stimuli intervals of 30 msec or shorter (equivalent to 17 Hz\n  periodic). If the flashes are separated by more than 30 ms, the\n  after-discharge to the first flash and the onset-response to the\n  second flash begin to recover (i.e. equivalent to &lt;17 Hz flicker).\n  These intervals roughly coincide with the critical flicker fusion\n  threshold in humans for 100% contrast stimuli in the fovea .<\/p>\n  \n  <p>This suggests that perceptual flicker fusion may be due to the lack of\n  robust transient responses to the flickering stimulus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://images.scholarpedia.org/w/images/thumb/8/8b/Flicker_fusion_fig5.png/360px-Flicker_fusion_fig5.png\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Source:<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bartley (1939).

The answer provided by <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/766\">bobthejoe<\/a> may provide insight as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would just raise a word of caution before leaping to the conclusion that we have evolved rapidly without looking into it, because while we often study human evolution quite extensively in biology classes and thus are more <strong><em>aware<\/em><\/strong> of changes like upright walking and opposable thumbs and increased brain size, that doesn't mean other animals didn't evolve that much as well (we just don't learn about them in as much detail). Being a psychologist and not a zoologist, I do not have the knowledge to say with any surety that other species did not evolve in their own ways to the same magnitude as we have in the last 3-4 million years, so perhaps someone else can help you there.<\/p>\n\n<p>But you ask <strong>whether we have a particular part of our brain that no other animal has<\/strong>; the answer to this is no, but the parts of our brains which we do share with animals are often much larger than as seen in those other species. <\/p>\n\n<h2>The \"Goal\" of evolution<\/h2>\n\n<p>I would like to point out here that human technology has nothing to do with evolution. Not only have all of our notable technological achievements occurred in the last couple hundreds years when human evolution was at its slowest (early human evolution as we know it today dates back <em>at least<\/em> 5-7 million years, and it was during this several million year period when all the genetic evolution you speak of happened), I would argue that human spaceships and computers are no more sophisticated to us than a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120000437.htm\">mushroom garden<\/a> and <a href=\"http://myportfolio.usc.edu/kentarom/2010/09/termites_friend_or_foe.html\">ventilation system<\/a> are to a termite. I could be wrong here but <strong>it seems as if you are under the impression that evolution is striving <em>towards<\/em> something<\/strong>... That humans are somehow intrinsically <em>better<\/em> than lions or sharks or beetles. On the contrary, each of these creatures is not significantly more or less adapted to their environments as we are to our own, and in many ways these creatures possess features which are beyond our own.<\/p>\n\n<p>I shall leave you with one of my favorite quotes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We need a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. We\n  patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate having\n  taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly\n  err. For the animal shall not be measured by man.

The other answers speak to biological evolution, but I want to point out that much of the most striking changes (\"nukes, computers...\") are due to the evolution of our culture.<\/p>\n\n<p>By 40,000 years ago most of our biological evolution to the present had happened (perhaps the most notable exception being changes related to our coevolution with disease organisms).  Yet although we had achieved upright brainiac-hood by the apparent evidence, we were not strikingly different from other large animals.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We had sharpened rocks and sticks, and made better use of the surroundings, particularly in non-food categories, than other animals.  We had been successful enough to spread throughout much of the old world.  Nevertheless, the overall contrast with other animals seems rather muted when viewed by the differences with the modern world.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the visible changes since then are due to evolution happening outside our genes and bodies in what can be called culture.  Other animals have culture but our nature gives us many times the cultural capability.  We build upon the culture we find ourselves in and make it more effective.  The cultural presevation and advances come not just from aping ('monkey see, monkey do'), but from language, and from mechanisms of cultural distribution and preservation, most notably from the invention of written language.  These things have driven the cultural evolution of the largest visible changes, those of the last few millenia. <\/p>\n","answer_id":787,"question_id":762,"up_vote_count":10},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TMSvO.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":542,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/542/hermann-ingjaldsson","reputation":586,"display_name":"Hermann Ingjaldsson"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8062730b4dcede7f2ead02beb9a2d0ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":393,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/393/matthew-patrick-cashatt","reputation":384,"display_name":"Matthew Patrick Cashatt","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":3542,"edited":false,"creation_date":1347568339,"comment_id":5354,"body":"Very interesting!!"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNlya.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9124,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9124/alex","reputation":404,"display_name":"Alex","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":3542,"edited":false,"creation_date":1416191805,"comment_id":38255,"body":"Well, at least they might have achieved local optima.

While both are important in our species, the memetic evolution is responsible for the changes you are citing (mostly technological advancements and \"culture\"). There are some interesting situations where memetic evolution is actually \"cancelling out\" genetic evolution. For example medical technology has largely allowed many (at least in the developed world) to survive in spite of genetic handicaps (lack of resistance to a pathogen, insulin, glasses, etc). \nDespite this I would argue we are still evolving rapidly in the genetic sense though not for the reasons you imply. In most vertebrates (any slow-reproducing creature), there is an ongoing selective pressure against pathogens. If their immune systems don't continually change (and antibiotics don't intervene), pathogens will wipe them out. While not as glorious as developing bipedalism, this is still evolution. We are also now a very transient species with people migrating extensively compared to the recent past. This leads to new genetic combinations and thus potential selection. \nIt could be argued (as others have) that the selective pressures for brain development (especially for language ala the FoxP2 gene) have brought about the rise of language, technology and culture. However I would argue that these evolutionary changes largely occurred, at minimum, the last few tens of thousands of years. \nAs others have also noted, crazy genius isn't <strong>THE<\/strong> end goal of evolution, it is merely <strong>ONE<\/strong> possible outcome.

Heck, light with the appropriate wavelength may even interact (or get diffracted in this case) with an organic material that possess many C=O-OH groups spaced with distances similar to the wavelength of light that is shone on it (provided they are regularly spaced and there are lots of them to produce an observable result). Since all organisms are carbon-based the C-C, C=O, C-O, C=_N etc dominate the constituents of the living matter from retina of the human eye to the photosensitive compounds in plants. Hence from the light-matter-interaction perspective all living beings are made up of more or less same materials and this is the reason why plants use the similar wavelength the human eye can detect for photosynthetic processes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source: just my intuition<\/p>\n","answer_id":19247,"question_id":510,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100006604836854/picture?type=large","user_type":"registered","user_id":8570,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8570/mattkaeo","reputation":884,"display_name":"mattkaeo"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1407545416,"creation_date":1407266857,"body":"<p>This question is related to the question: Why are some things transparent and others opaque? <\/p>\n\n<p>Being able to see something requires that it is opaque and that sufficient light illuminates it. <\/p>\n\n<p>UV and shorter wavelengths are not as prevalent as visible light on earth. The world would appear too dark to see if we used UV and shorter wavelengths. This is because our atmosphere absorbs most high energy light. <\/p>\n\n<p>Infrared and longer wavelengths of light pass through many objects which would make vision difficult. There's less light here reaching the earth and even less being refracted. <\/p>\n\n<p>Think about how much our vision relies on indirect light. The frequencies at which most objects are opaque makes those frequencies useful for vision due to the accumulation of refracted light. <\/p>\n\n<p>Why are many objects opaque in the visible spectrum of light? Longer wavelengths of light have less energy than the valence electrons on most matter. Shorter wavelengths have too much energy, they cause chemical reactions, in addition to not being very prevalent on the surface of the earth. <\/p>\n\n<p>Electrons are what absorb then remit light and have thresholds based on their chemistry for what they can absorb. No absorption = transparent. Too much energy and chemical reactions start to happen, which may be undesirable, or desirable in the synthesis of vitamin D by UV light. <\/p>\n\n<p>Plants extract energy for chemical reactions from wavelengths shorter than infrared, which is too weak to drive photosynthesis, and not as abundant as visible light. But also absorb wavelengths longer than ionizing frequencies, which are not very prevalent, and usually cause damage. <\/p>\n\n<p>Visible light is the spectrum of light which is prevalent enough on earth to see, but is not so energetic it would harm biological systems.

(<a href=\"http://www.tiem.utk.edu/%7Egavrila/583/C2.pdf\">See also this chapter by Sergey Gavrilets.<\/a>) Decreasing the frequency of a haplotype through recombination will necessarily increase the frequency of a different haplotype (adjusted by selection).<\/p>\n\n<p>$D$ is the measure of linkage disequilibrium. It ranges from $-0.25$ to $0.25$ and indicates how much the haplotype frequencies deviate from an expectation of no linkage ($D=0$, the loci are independent).<\/p>\n\n<p>First, assume no natural selection. That is, $w_i = 1$ and therefore ${\\bar w} = 1$. When fitness is equal, the equations reduce down to <\/p>\n\n<p>$$\\Delta X_i = \\pm Dr$$<\/p>\n\n<p>Some recombination will occur between the linked loci proportional to the distance between them. In a large randomly mating population with no selection, $D$ will eventually decay to zero.  The larger the value of $r$, the quicker that decay will occur. Eventually, the haplotype frequencies will appear as if they are not linked. (<a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/tutorials/Multi-locus_population_genetics12.asp\">See this figure.<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, assume that $A$ and $B$ are linked, with these four haplotype frequencies:<\/p>\n\n<p>$$A_1B_1 = 0.5$$\n$$A_1B_2 = 0.38$$\n$$A_2B_1 = 0.05$$\n$$A_2B_2 = 0.07$$<\/p>\n\n<p>In the absence of natural selection and assuming that $r=0.1$, then $\\Delta X_i = \\pm 0.0016$, again with plus or minus depending on the value of $i$. This is the rate the frequencies will change each generation.  As $r$ decreases, the rate of decay decreases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Differential fitness among the haplotypes will also affect the rate of decay. The fitness interactions among loci on the same chromosomes and between homologs can get rather complex depending heterozygote advantage, epistasis, etc. (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1210557/pdf/49.pdf\">Lewontin 1964<\/a> for several fitness models). <\/p>\n\n<p>The equation $w_i = X_1w_{i1} + X_2w_{i2} + X_3w_{i3} + X_4w_{i4}$ is the average fitness of the each haplotype in combination with all the other possible haplotypes. For example, for $w_1$, you're calculating the average fitness of four genotypes: $A_1B_1/A_1B_1$, $A_1B_1/A_1B_2$, $A_1B_1/A_2B_1$, and $A_1B_1/A_12B_2$.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am uncertain why $w_{14}$ is used in the second term of the numerator. I thought it might be because that combination is heterozygous at both loci so recombination generates all four possible haplotypes. However, both Lewontin and Kojima (1960) and Lewontin (1964) use $w_{11}$. It may also be that a relative fitness component is necessary for comparison so the fitness of any one of the genotypes could be used there. I don't know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regrdless, as a simple example to illustrate the effects of selection, assume $r=0.1$, $\\bar w = 0.5$, and $w_{14} = 1$ (heterozygote advantage, given maximum relative fitness). For $w_1 = 0.9$ then $\\Delta X_1 = 0.397$. Selection strongly favors this haplotype in all genotypic combinations so it will increase in frequency.  For $w_1 = 0.3$ then $\\Delta X_1 = -0.203$. The haplotype is selected against and decreases much more rapidly, relative to no selection at all.  The same idea would apply for the other haplotypes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Lewontin, R.C. 1964. The interaction of selection and linkage. I.

Wild fruits probably have much more diversity, and there would much less distinction between fruit and vegetable.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20327,"question_id":20326,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1407459540},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"score":0,"post_id":20343,"edited":false,"creation_date":1407511656,"comment_id":30505,"body":"Squirrels mostly eat nuts which are not intended to be eaten because their seeds are destructed in the process thus there is no surprise that nuts typically have no attractive color."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8517,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8517/mike-taylor","reputation":5784,"display_name":"Mike Taylor"},"score":0,"post_id":20343,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe87113ced5f370d038b90a43fd1fe1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":408,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/408/anixx","reputation":909,"display_name":"Anixx","accept_rate":20},"edited":false,"creation_date":1407512156,"comment_id":30507,"body":"On the other hand, squirrels often take the nuts and bury them but do not later eat them.

The review is broad but they do have a section on frugivory.  They highlight hypotheses developed by McKey, and Howe and Estabrook (see Howe and Smallwood for citations) that suggest plants may use one of two strategies. <\/p>\n\n<p>One strategy is the \"high investment model.\" Plants invest lots of resources to produce large seeds and nutrient rich fruits. THe hypothesis is that these types of fruits tend to attract relatively few but specialized frugivores that are will to invest the energy necessary to find these types of fruits and their associated nutritional reward. <\/p>\n\n<p>The second strategy is called the \"low investment model.\" In this model, plants invest little in individuals seeds and fruits but produce an abundance of them. The hypothesis is that these types of fruits will be eaten by as many different potential seed dispersers as possible. These tend to be very small or starchy although they can still be colored as you describe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other factors also come into play. For example, tropical fruits tend to have large seeds and nutrient rich pulp while temperate fruits tend to be smaller and offer less nutritional reward.  All of this is placed in the context of the community diversity of frugivores. The Howe and Smallwood paper was an interesting read.<\/p>\n\n<p>A paper by <a href=\"http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/b_fdi_45-46/010006673.pdf\">Gatier-Hion et al. (1985)<\/a> looked at the characters of fruit choice and seed dispersal mechanisms by tropical forest vertebrates. The showed the relationships between fruit characteristics and the corresponding frugivores. They looked at 122 different fruit species and the frugivores that consumed them.  Their results showed that fruits tended to separate along one of three axes:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Heavy, indehiscent fruits with fibrous flesh and well protected\nseeds vs light, dehiscent fruits with unprotected seeds. Many of\nsmall fruits are red,<\/li>\n<li>Lots of seeds produced (typically the the large indehiscent) vs few\nseeds produced, and<\/li>\n<li>Juicy and brightly colored fruits vs dry and dull-colored fruits.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Figure 2 from Gautier-Hion et al., shown here, shows the relationship between different frugivores and the fruit types.  Notice that small granivores, which are frugivores, don't eat large, juicy fruits. They consume lots of small green or brown grains that are easy to manipulate and produced in high quantities.  Squirrels are similar. <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hOhsE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, as you suspected, fruits and seeds have evolved in response to their frugivores but the fruits do not always have the traits you listed. I think, but do not know for certain, that the fruit traits you list are the result of selection being driving by the frugivores. The sugars provide lots of quick energy, which is necessary for active animals. The carbs probably provide a much greater nutritional reward than salts or proteins (which are present anyway). The colors may help the fruits to stand out against the green foliage (for organisms that are not red-green colorblind). These traits probably provide the greatest reward (lots of energy) with the lowest energy investment by the frugivore (easy to find). <\/p>\n\n<p>Throughout, I've assumed natural conditions and not fruits modified by artificial selection for human consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature Cited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Gautier-Hion, A., et al. 1985.

Competition between similar species is one possibility. Consider for example gorillas or chimps. The two species of gorillas occupy different habitats so they rarely compete with each other for resources (food, water, shelter, etc.). The two species of chimpanzees have non-overlapping ranges (or minimally so) so again they do not compete for resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chimps and gorillas do overlap with each other for parts of their range and even potentially use the same resources, although no competition for resources has been observed (see <a href=\"http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla\">this primate factsheet<\/a> and McNeilage 2001). The same applies for the orangutans, which lives on two different southeast Asian islands.<\/p>\n\n<p>The genus <em>Homo<\/em> is an entirely different story. As you may know, <em>Homo<\/em> first evolved in east central Africa. The first species to leave Africa and disperse across Europe and Asia was <em>Homo erectus<\/em>. This migration out of Africa happened as early as aout 1.8 million years ago. <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> had not yet evolved. However, while <em>H. erectus<\/em> was establishing itself across Europe and Asia, populations still in Africa continued to evolve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modern <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> evolved in central Africa perhaps about 250-200,000 years ago and dispersed out of Africa about 100,000 years ago. <em>Homo sapiens<\/em> also dispersed across Europe and Asia. Both <em>H. erectus<\/em> and <em>H. sapiens<\/em> co-occurred across parts of their range. Some have argued (Stringer and Andrews, among others, I believe but I'll have to be at work before I can verify ths reference) that <em>H. sapiens<\/em> outcompeted <em>H. erectus<\/em>, leading to its eventual extinction by competition. They occurred together and used the same resources, so <em>H. sapiens<\/em> could have caused the extinction of <em>H. erectus<\/em>. This has been called the replacement hypothesis. The later evolving species (<em>H. sapiens<\/em>) replaced the earlier evolving <em>H. erectus<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v416/n6876/abs/416045a.html\">Templeton (2002)<\/a> has argued that the two species interbred so the species became integrated rather replaced (if I am interpreting him correctly).  While I don't dispute the possibility of interbreeding, I am skeptical of Templeton's complete dismissal of replacement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Complicating the picture is <em>H. neanderthalensis<\/em>. Genetic evidence published by <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full\">Green et al. (2010)<\/a> suggests that Neanderthals diverged from <em>H. sapiens<\/em> (in central Africa) between 800,000-500,000 years ago and also dispersed out of Africa.  They also provided evidence of interbreeding between <em>H. sapiens<\/em> and <em>H. neanderthalensis<\/em> in Europe.  Modern <em>H. sapiens<\/em> may also have outcompeted <em>H. neanderthals<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p>All of this was occurring during the Pleistocene ice age. Europe was experiencing repeated bouts of extensive glaciation. Thus, it is also possible that climate change caused or contributed to the extinction of <em>H. erectus<\/em>, <em>H. neanderthalensis<\/em>, or both.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, the processes that led to the extinction of other species of <em>Homo<\/em> are complex and likey interactive. Competetion among species is, in my view, well within the realm of possibility but would be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to test. Climate change is also a very likely contributing factor. There are several other hypotheses but I have tried to hit the major highlights.  The debate is certainly not settled.<\/p>\n\n<p>McNeilage A. 2001.

Although this can be a good barometer but it is misleading. Passaging can stress the cells if performed very frequently, although again that depends on how fast the cells are dividing. <\/p>\n\n<p>You should not think of passage (and cell culture in general) in terms of the procedure itself but in terms of population doubling (PD) which can be calculated using the formula provided here (<a href=\"http://www.sciencellonline.com/site/techsupport.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencellonline.com/site/techsupport.php<\/a>). I personally use [Log10(harvesting cell No/seeding cell No)/Log10(2)]. This should allow you to characterise your cellular behaviour between every passage and allows you to draw a cumulative PD graph. Once the cumulative PD versus time becomes non-linear, then you would know that the cells have changed behaviour and it might be best to use a fresh stock.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main advantage of this method is that you are not relying on guess work and deal with solid numbers and allows you to predict when you should expect to start a fresh batch for passage. Although passage numbers can do the same job if you assume per passage, the cells have done a certain PD but this is more of a guess work and you can not track how well your cells are doing at a given time point. For example one of the main problems with using a passage as a measure is that you can passage the cells at 98% confluence to a fresh flask and although that counts as a passage but it is pretty uninformative in terms of cell behaviour and gives you no solid numbers and you can do this many many times and although you would have done high number of passages but your cells would appear ok. Although such an exercise is pointless and will probably stress the cells but it is just to make the point that passage numbers are not necessarily a very informative and quantifiable measure of how well the cells are doing or behaving hence PD and cumulative PD should be used. Another advantage is that since you are dealing with actual cell numbers, if you changed your cell culture flask size from lets say T-75 to T-25, you don't have to be worried about changes to your frequency of passage or having to make further guess work on how that has effected your cell behaviour.<\/p>\n\n<p>My main advice is that you should keep you frequency of passage the same at least in the beginning (although keep an eye on the cell density as you don't perhaps want to let cells to be too over-confluent or unconfluent when passaging, depending on your specific methodology and what has been established in your lab), but count your seeding and harvesting density (cell No) and calculate the PD and cumulative PD and draw a cumulative PD vs time graph and monitor the behaviour of cells. This should give you a good indication of you cellular behaviour under the conditions you are working with them since guidelines are just that, guides and they can never substitute experimental characterisation of your cells under your conditions and handling method!<\/p>\n","answer_id":20320,"question_id":14733,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1407440127}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/14733/whats-the-recommended-maximum-passage-number-for-mammalian-cells-nci-h441","last_activity_date":1407440127,"creation_date":1391114142,"answer_count":1,"title":"What's the recommended maximum passage number for mammalian cells (NCI-H441)?","body":"<p>Is there a generally accepted maximum number of times you should split and reseed mammalian culture cells before restarting cultures from new stock?<\/p>\n","question_id":14733,"tags":["cell-culture"],"score":5,"accepted_answer_id":20320,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1101,"up_vote_count":5},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hpj4v.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3053,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3053/drosophila","reputation":1073,"display_name":"Drosophila","accept_rate":50},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxfyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3059,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3059/dd3","reputation":2303,"display_name":"dd3","accept_rate":95},"score":0,"post_id":8319,"edited":false,"creation_date":1368474539,"comment_id":10576,"body":"I have no experience with this, but apparently you can download it: <a href=\"http://www.modencode.org/publications/faq/#How_do_I_access_modENCODE_data.3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">modencode.org/publications/faq/&hellip;<\/a>"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":3,"post_id":8319,"edited":false,"creation_date":1368510003,"comment_id":10588,"body":"Download the data and parse locally.."}],"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Uayv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8186,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8186/devashish-das","reputation":3783,"display_name":"Devashish Das","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1407437063,"creation_date":1407437063,"body":"<p>Options:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You can always <a href=\"ftp://data.modencode.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">download the data<\/a> (as @WYSIWYG has suggested in the comment). <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Transfer the data to <a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galaxy<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Convert and export the selection of your choice.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/csXc2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://modencode.oicr.on.ca/fgb2/gbrowse/fly/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://modencode.oicr.on.ca/fgb2/gbrowse/fly/<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":20319,"question_id":8319,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8319/how-can-i-view-modencode-data-faster","last_activity_date":1407437063,"creation_date":1368397550,"answer_count":1,"title":"How can I view modENCODE data faster?","body":"<p>I am trying to view several data tracks in the modENCODE GBrowse genomic browser.

DNA polymerase continues to make the strand until it essentially either drops off or until the cycle is over and it is time for the cycle to repeat itself.

The X and the Y together are something like 1.5% of the total DNA in the human cell.  The X chromosome is also in common, so it has the same chromosomal (genetic) variations the same as women and men. <\/p>\n\n<p>While I am not sure about the differences you point out, its for sure there are lots of differences between the biology of men and women!  The reason that women's traits might have different variances than men comes from the fact that in women there are 2 X chromosomes and in men there is only one, as well as the additional Y chromosome. <\/p>\n\n<p>If there are any singular defects in the X chromosome a man carries, it will not be balanced out in the human male.  (other organisms have different sex chromosome schemes).  For instance because there is a cluster of genes that help the eye see in color, women's sense of color (i.e. from their cone cells) is sometimes better than men.  With 2 X chromosomes there is even the possibility of a woman who has <a href=\"http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/anp07/Looking%20for%20Madam%20Tetrachromat.htm\">four different color receptors in their cones<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, why men see better in the dark (i.e. greater sensitivity in the rod cells), is possibly due to an extra Blue Rod pigment gene that remains on the Y chromosome (see above reference).  This is both an accident of genetics, but also an adaptive 'choice' that men would have different visual acuities than women. <\/p>\n\n<p>Its also known that woman and men may have different epigenetic patterns, with some epigenetic modifications coming from the mother and others from the father.  This is adaptive and also not the direct result of the XY chromosomes. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you really want to blow your mind, it turns out that for the most part women's 2 X chromosomes are mostly mosaic.  That is in each cell only one of the randomly selected X chromosomes are active.  Recessive/dominant X genes are often not the case. <\/p>\n\n<p>So in other words, I would say that many of the differences are adaptive (they were evolved to be that way) and not a genetic accident.  Each gene or trait will have their own story in many cases.

Students have to calculate the number of base pair differences between each pair of sequences which, in our case, range from 2-10 nucleotides. <\/p>\n\n<p>They then use the pairwise differences to construct their tree, with the understanding that fewer nucleotide differences between organisms means they are more closely related.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can do this type of activity over a couple of days (depending on time). Then, you can begin to show them trees that become gradually more complex.

The best thing to do to ensure that you only have PCR generated DNA samples is that once your PCR is over, treat your DNA mixture with Dpn I enzyme, which cuts methylated DNA, which is essentially cellular DNA as they get methylated in cells and it should not effect you PCR generated DNA as it won't be methylated. Look at page 7 and page 12 of this document for further instructions on using Dpn I (<a href=\"http://www.chem.agilent.com/library/usermanuals/Public/210518.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chem.agilent.com/library/usermanuals/Public/210518.pdf<\/a>). You can subsequently clean and isolate your PCR generated DNA using any kit such as QIAquick gel extraction kit (QAGEN) using essentially this protocol but you are not using any gels (<a href=\"http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~chenlab/protocol_files/agarose_gel_extraction.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~chenlab/protocol_files/agarose_gel_extraction.pdf<\/a>). You can use other kits but this always worked for me! (please note that I'm not promoting any kits here!!) Now if you have any amplicons from your PCR then you should be able to nanodrop it (using the 260/230 ratio as your guide) and get a reasonable value for your amplicon concentration.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now if at this stage you still have your PCR DNA as indicated by nanodrop and perhaps a test digest still gives the expected bands then the problem is with the running process and highly likely your gel which was the first thing I suspected to be the case. If not then you do not have any amplicons and you are simply trying to run your original DNA.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although I have never worked with very large cellular DNA molecules before (I work with plasmids), however I was trained to run very large DNA (in agarose gel) on very low voltage such as 10-50 V overnight in a cold room since large cellular DNA doesn't tend to run very well in gels although that mostly applies to chromosomal DNA but 10kb is still quite large.

[...] Current gene-based evolutionary theories cannot explain important patterns of human altruism, pointing towards the importance of both theories of cultural evolution as well as gene-culture co-evolution [4].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet, similar behavior was observed in chimpanzees:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition, we demonstrate similar though less robust skills and motivations in three young chimpanzees [1].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Altruism has evolved under some conditions:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified. When one or more of these conditions are met, altruism or cooperation can evolve if the cost-to-benefit ratio of altruistic and cooperative acts is greater than a threshold value [2].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Altruism is related to kin selection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1964, Hamilton formalized the idea of kin selection to explain the evolution of altruistic behaviours. Since then, numerous examples from a diverse array of taxa have shown that seemingly altruistic actions towards close relatives are a common phenomenon. Although many species use kin recognition to direct altruistic behaviours preferentially towards relatives, this important aspect of social biology is less well understood theoretically [3].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Warneken F, Tomasello M. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16513986\" rel=\"nofollow\">Altruistic helping in human infants and young chimpanzees.<\/a> Science. 2006 Mar 3;311(5765):1301-3. doi: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1121448\" rel=\"nofollow\">10.1126/science.1121448<\/a>.

This suggests to me that Darwin thought of them as different processes.  A spot check of various evolutionary texts show the authors all using some variation of Darwin's definition.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the two are are clearly different but not necessarily separate. Both NS and SS affect fitness, a major component of the evolutionary process.  I tend to think of SS as nested within NS. NS affects fitness indirectly. Beneficial traits increase survivorship.  The longer individuals survive, the more reproductive opportunities they will have and fitness will, on average, increase. But, survivorship does not guarantee reproduction. Thus, I think natural selection acts indirectly on reproductive success.<\/p>\n\n<p>SS operates directly on reproductive success because males selected by females will reproduce, increasing their fitness. Sex is, after all, a natural process. In my view, female choice is the \"environment\" of the male (as far as reproduction) so variation of male traits in the female choice \"environment\" differentially affects the fitness of the males. That is natural selection. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is the evolutionary processes due to sexual conflict are SS processes?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely. Sexual selection ultimately arises because of a difference between genders of energy investment in gametes. Males produce lots of gametes and relatively little energetic cost. Females produce relatively few gametes with lots of energetic cost (think of tiny sperm vs large, yolk-filled eggs). It benefits males to mate with as many females as possible because, even if a mating produces no offspring, he lost very little of his energy investment. Females will be choosier because they can't afford to waste gametes. Thus, there is an inherent conflict of interest between males and females.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are the evolutionary processes of sexually antagonist genes SS processes?\n  Sexually antagonist genes are those genes where one allele is favored in females while another allele is favored in males (my own definition)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Are these genes related exclusively to reproduction?  If so, then that would be consistent with the original concept of SS. However, sexually antagonistic genes are not necessarily the result of or a cause of SS.  For example, Rice (1992) argued that sexually antagonistic genes may explain the evolutionary reduction of recombination between primitive sex chromosomes. <\/p>\n\n<p>Rice, W.R. 1992. Sexually antagonistic genes: Experimental evidence. Science 256: 1436-1439.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can SS be accurately defined or is there a continuum of kinds or processes from complete SS processes to complete NS processes?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think SS is accurately defined, but whether is is a type of NS or not is (I think) open for debate. As I described above, I think of SS as a particular type of NS, one that operates directly on reproductive success rather than indirectly. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Below is a list of scenarios where you can answer by yes or no whether SS is involved in the evolution of some feature. In all of these scenarios, we'll consider cases where the males have to find a mate\u2026<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The males need good ears to find the females before other males. Is SS involved in the adaptation of ears abilities? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Depends. Do males <em>and females<\/em> also use their ears for other purposes, such as detecting prey or predators?  Is hearing ability much greater in males than in females? Darwin specifically <a href=\"http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=269\" rel=\"nofollow\">addresses such a scenario<\/a>. (Last sentence of page 256, first part of page 257.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I think these ideas play out for most of your scenarios. It depends on if the traits differ between the sexes (not specified in your scenarios) and the traits lead directly to increased male reproductive success. But I will address one more.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The males need good camouflage because when they fly to find a mate they may get eaten by a predator and die before reproducing.

Species branch off much more like a tree. At some point in the past the last common ancestor of humans and monkeys split into two directions, one that became the apes including humans, and one that became modern monkeys. Evolution did not stop for either branch, but only our branch became humans, after several more branchings. Sometimes species adapt and evolve without major changes in morphology, for example modern turtles look a lot like turtles from 100 million years ago, but this doesn't mean they haven't evolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>The intermediate species are often lost with time as environmental conditions and competition changes. For example, if one early human group found itself competing with a slightly more advanced human group with better tools, the more primitive group would have trouble getting enough food and eventually die off, leaving the more advanced group to pass its genes on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if those more primitive humans were more suited to a particular niche, they could survive there. Lets say they could climb trees better ( assume REALLY primitive ancestors, barely out of the forest ), they might survive in the forested areas while the more advanced groups become dominant in the grasslands. Something like this is why our ancestors didn't totally displace monkeys, the monkeys were better suited for their forested ecosystem.

This is because population as a whole wasn't  reproducing as fast as they disappeared, for a variety of reasons. By disappeared I mean: went away to other environment or died out.<\/li>\n<li>In another environment, so much changes had spread through the population that at one time the new offspring was born with their genotype now \"too much\" different and thus incompatible. By \"too much\" I mean this: they could still mate with both partners from their population and with \"less changed\" neighboring populations, but they could only produce a <strong>fertile offspring<\/strong> with former but <strong>not<\/strong> with the latter. We nowadays refer to such situation as \"they became new species\". From this point they obviously couldn't spread \"their\" genetic changes anymore to other environments via reproduction (spreading parts of genotypes). Their offspring would be infertile. They only could spread \"their\" genetic changes by sending whole groups of folks (complete genotypes) to other environment to try and cope there. And sometimes to kill others interfering, because, hey, that's what living creatures sometimes just do. <\/li>\n<li>The population lived without \"too much\" change in the genotype and still exists today in the given environment. Without \"too much\" change means they were unchanged or rather changed slow enough that at any given time they could leak their changes to other populated environments via reproduction (they kept being the same species as their neighbors).\n<ul>\n<li>I have written about genetic \"changes\". You call these \"advantages\" and even \"modernizations\", but for the sake of argument it just doesn't matter (and only blurs the picture with the unnecessary concept of \"superiority\").

This sounds blindingly obvious, but when presented by skulls from two species, such as <em>Homo erectus<\/em> and <em>Homo sapiens<\/em>, many will then ask where the evidence is for the species that came between those two. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons why you can't see all of these in-between forms: <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The fossil record is imperfect<\/strong>. Although there are no longer any \"missing links\" in the fossil record for the evolution of humans from our most recent common ancestor with chimpanzees, not every change in skeleton shape has been preserved for us to look at.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Species boundaries are applied retrospectively<\/strong>. This means that when we find a new set of bones that seem to be in-between two species, we give these bones a new species name, because they clearly don't belong to the other species we've already identified. The bones actually represent one of the \"in-between\" forms that people are asking about, but we can't just label it \"intermediate\" or \"missing link\". It has to be categorised as a new species or sub-species.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You're not technically looking for an \"intermediate\"<\/strong>. It's not that chimpanzees are an \"intermediate\" between humans and some ancestral species. It's that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor. When you see a pictures of a neanderthal, they might superficially look like an intermediate between humans and chimpanzees, a sort of hybrid between the two, but that's not quite right. It's not that chimpanzees eventually became neanderthals, which eventually became modern humans. It's actually that humans and neanderthals <em>share a common ancestor<\/em> and that ancestor is <em>no longer around<\/em> for reasons given in other answers. Similarly, neanderthals and chimpanzees share a common ancestor that is now extinct. My point is that if you're looking for something like a \"crocatoo\" that's a hybrid between a crocodile and cockatoo, you won't find it. Yes, crocodiles and cockatoos share a common ancestor somewhere in their family trees, but there's no reason that it will look half like one species and half like the other!

First, let's correct a misunderstanding in the question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sunlight does penetrate beyond 200m in the ocean. The intensity is not enough for photosynthesis to occur (and thus no phytoplankton below 200m) but depths between 200-1000m can receive enough sunlight for vision. <\/p>\n\n<p>The region between 200-1000m is called the mesopelagic. Because there is enough light for vision, many mesopelagic species have eyes to see. Because light is extremely dim (humans would not be able to see), mesopelagic species tend to have very large eyes to gather as much light as possible. Vision is very important to mesopelagic species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Below 1000m, we reach the bathypelagic (and, continuing deeper, the abyssopelagic and hadopelagic). Here, light penetration is insufficient for vision. Below 1000m is pitch black. In the bathypelagic (and deeper), you tend to see a reduction of eye size and sometimes a complete loss of eyes. Bioluminescence is still present (although much more common in mesopelagic fishes) but much less important. The physiological cost of producing and maintaining eyes is energetically expensive, so most species that live below 1000m have very weak eyes, if they have them at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because the eyes of bathypelagic (and deeper) species still serve their original function, I would say the eyes of deep-sea organisms are not <a href=\"http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu/excerpt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">vestigial<\/a>, in the sense of having completely lost their original function or serving a new function.<\/p>\n","answer_id":20230,"question_id":3399,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/3399/is-vision-a-vestigial-sense-for-deep-ocean-species","last_activity_date":1407189276,"creation_date":1346350630,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is vision a vestigial sense for deep ocean species?","body":"<p>Sunlight doesn't penetrate beyond a couple of hundred feet from the surface of the ocean.
