Until then the G6P is immediately converted to G1P and on to glycogen, in the reactions in sunboyharry's answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>The question suggests a misunderstanding of the role of glucokinase in liver, which can be better considered if we first make clear the role of liver and skeletal muscle in glucose metabolism. The role of the liver is to deal with excess glucose after a meal by trapping it in the cell as G6P. Although initially the G6P may be converted to G1P and hence to glycogen, this is not the only fate of G6P. Subsequently it may be directed to glycolysis and to the pentose phosphate shunt to provide the acetyl units and reducing power (NADPH) needed for fatty acid synthesis. (The fatty acids are converted to triglycerides and exported to the adipose tissue.) When the blood glucose falls the role of the liver is to release glucose into the blood to supply those tissues that depend on it (brain and erythrocytes in starvation, skeletal muscle if the fall is due to muscle exercise). The skeletal muscle, in contrast, is only concerned with storing glucose as glycogen when it is available, and converting it to G6P for glycolysis when it needs ATP to power muscle contraction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucokinase has a key role in the regulation of blood glucose concentration by the liver. To paraphrase (and edit slightly) Cornish-Bowden and Cardenas: \"Mammals have two types of enzymes to catalyse the formation of G6P from glucose. Glucokinase [hexokinase D in their nomenclature] differs significantly from the other type [generally just referred to as hexokinase]. Its abundance varies markedly with hormonal status; it requires much higher glucose concentrations (about 10 mM) for half saturation, and is insensitive to physiological concentrations of G6P. It is thus well adapted to respond to variations in blood-glucose concentrations.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>To clarify, 10mM is in the region of the blood glucose concentration (ca. 5mM) so the glucokinase reaction will be affected by the relative concentrations of blood glucose and intracellular G6P in a standard mass action manner, which will determine whether the liver takes up glucose or releases it into the blood. If glucokinase were inhibited allosterically by G6P like hexokinase, this couldn't work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let's turn to G6P and hexokinase in skeletal muscle. Hexokinase has a much higher affinity for glucose than hexokinase and will convert it efficiently to G6P. As long as G6P is then converted to G1P for glycogen synthesis, G6P will not build up. However when glycogen synthesis stops because the capacity of the muscle to store glycogen is reached, the concentration of G6P will increase and turn hexokinase off. This, in turn, will cause a build up of intracellular glucose and prevent glucose transport into the muscle. This makes sense, because with full glycogen stores, and in the absence of need for contraction, glucose will not be metabolized by the muscle; it will be left in the blood for the liver to handle. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, the key point about G6P inhibition of hexokinase, and the apparent source of confusion in the question, is that it only occurs at concentrations that are reached when the G6P is not being metabolized within the cell. <\/p>\n\n<p>Reference and Footnote<\/p>\n\n<p>Ref for citation: Cornish-Bowden, A and Cardenas, M.. (1991) Trends in Biochemical Sciences 16, pp281-2. (This article also makes the point that the kinetics of glucokinase are sigmoidal and not hyperbolic as stated in most texts, and that the enzyme is not specific for glucose. Neither of these points affect the argument here. The former does indicate that my reference to glucose control of glucokinase operating in \"a standard mass action manner\" is a simplification. It does respond to changes in glucose concentration in the blood range, but in a more sophisticated manner than an enzyme with simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":43979,"question_id":38696,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1457262163}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/38696/how-do-muscle-cells-synthesize-glycogen","last_activity_date":1457262163,"creation_date":1442069842,"answer_count":2,"title":"How do muscle cells synthesize glycogen?","body":"<p>Hexokinase enzyme is present in all cells (including muscle cells) and can be suppressed by excessive G-6-P product. So that's why in the liver, glucokinase can act on glucose without inhibition of it despite excessive G-6-P product; that's why it can generate glycogen and not let excessive glucose flow back in bloodstream.

Because as i said above, HK activity is dependent on intracellular glucose level, and cannot phosphorylate glucose to hold it inside the cell.

The common thing in all three is a resulting reduction in genetic diversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Genetic drift is a change in allele frequencies due to process of random sampling to form a finite offspring population from parent population. Ultimately some alleles gets fixed and genetic diversity decreases. However decreasing population size or small population size is not a necessity for drift to happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Population bottleneck and founder effect are similar population genetic events that are happening in different ecological context. Both results in decreased population size (for the population of interest) and decreased genetic diversity. But the exact ecological context determines how much of the decrease in diversity is due to drift and how much of that is due to selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Population bottleneck refers to an event, where a population is intact but only small portion of the individuals are able to pass their alleles to future generations. This may be associated with strong natural selection, if possessors of a trait are more fit under the condition that causes the bottleneck (if the condition is a draught, better water preserving traits would be favoured for example). Or the process may be associated with drift if individuals don't have traits that would provide them an advantage (if the condition is a volcano eruption, survivors would be random with respect to their alleles).<\/p>\n\n<p>Founder effect refers to an event when a small subpopulation migrates to an isolated region. Isolation may be due to distance or some geographic agent.\nHere, again the individuals to form the subpopulation may be random with respect to their alleles, or there may be a selection towards traits that provide some advantage in migration for example.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think that a population bottleneck is more likely to be associated with strong negative selection and a founder effect is more likely to be associated with genetic drift.<\/p>\n\n<p>However these concepts are not about relative importance of drift and selection. (I emphasized my answer on drift/selection because the question considers them as examples of drift.) These both concepts are about the loss of genetic diversity due to decreased population size, and for that matter, I would say they are the same thing in different ecological context.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can refer population genetics text books by Hamilton (Hamilton, 2009)\u2060 or Gillespie (Gillespie, 2004) for example. You can find related discussion on sections about effective population size.\nThere you can see that neither population (or genetic) bottleneck nor founder effect are treated as \u201cexamples\u201d of genetic drift or defined as events caused by genetic drift.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me explicitly state my point. \nPopulation (or genetic) bottleneck and founder effect are events (driven by some ecological factor) of sharp but temporarily decrease in population size. Due to this decrease, genetic diversity is decreased and stays low even after population size increase again. This is an example of the case, where effective population size and census population size are very different.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now comes the part creating the confusion:\nBoth of these effects enhance genetic drift. But they are not caused by genetic drift. Genetic drift can be effective also when population size does not decrease.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also they are not necessarily examples of genetic drift, meaning that, there may cases where the ecological factor causing the mentioned effects does not affect individuals within population randomly with respect to some of their traits. In that case some loci will lose its allelic diversity due to selection. But here again it is not selection that causes the mentioned effect, the cause is some ecological factor. The ecological factor causing the bottleneck may or may not cause selection. Population expansion/shrinkage is a dimension, selection/drift is another dimension. <\/p>\n\n<p>Gillespie, J. H. (2004).

The founders were not a random sampling of the main population, but, once isolated as a small population, would undergo random drift<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, a founder effect does NOT refer to the ppulation bottleneck causing by a founding event. A founder effect refers to the increase in genetic drift (loss of genetic diversity is expected) caused by a founding event. A founding event is the event by which few individuals (eventually only one) quit a large population to settle down a new small populations. As such, a founder event is a type of population bottleneck.

Wikipedia indicates that these two terms are synonyms. However I could not find any paper that formally define the term genetic bottleneck but all the papers using this term seem to be specifically interested into the genetic signature of population bottleneck. As such, the semantic relationship between population bottleneck and genetic bottleneck could be the same as between founding event and founder effect.

The answer is: almost certainly, yes. Python is a programming language of the type that can be used to automate the solution of this sort of problem, just as C, C++, Java, Perl could.<\/p>\n\n<p>How would you go about it? You would first solve the problem by hand, analyse the logic of your solution and then try to devise a general algorithm based on this logic that can deal with a variety of cases. Then you would code this in python (or whatever). The program would have to deal with inaccuracies in real values of fragment lengths (your data are obviously contrived) and the possibility of more than one fragment of the same length (see below).  If you used python and wanted graphic output you would need to use a library that provides graphics as python does not come with graphics like Java does. I gather there are some. However this is certainly not the easiest of programming tasks for a beginner, as you'll see when you try to analyse the logic of manual solution. And of course the data might be insufficient to provide a unique solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>However as this is a homework assignment you may also be wanting to find a program to check your answer and perhaps be unsure of how to go about it. I don't know of any packages to do this \u2014 it's perhaps not 'cutting edge'. So how to go about it?<\/p>\n\n<p>What I would do is start with the single digests and draw a set of diagrams for each of the possible arrangements of the restriction sites in each case (pencil and paper work well here). Then I'd look at the simplest double-digest, identify unique fragments that were also present in the single digests and thus not cut by the second enzyme, and again draw diagrams of the possibilities for the pairs of restrictions sites. Be careful; the HindIII/BamHI double-digest doesn't add up to 900, so there must be two fragments of the same size here. When you have all the possibilities drawn out, there is presumably only one final restriction diagram that is consistent with all the data. <\/p>\n\n<p>On second thoughts, devising an algorithm for solving this general case would be quite a demanding task. If you are starting programming I'd tackle easier algorithms first. And an effective algorithm might adopt a brute force approach rather than the semi-intuitive way we solve these by hand. For example your algorithm might generate all possible maps for each of the the three single digestions, and then generate all possible maps for the double-digestions, together with a calculation of the size of fragments the double-digestions would generate. These would be compared with the size of the actual fragments from double-digestions, eliminating those possibilities that don't fit. Coding it would involve writing methods/functions (or whatever they are called in python) to generate these maps, storing the coordinates of the sites in a data structure such as an array, and writing other methods to make comparisons etc.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43920,"question_id":43902,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1457130644},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19e791aa510036f373ede0027416cf42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":21936,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/21936/noushin","reputation":168,"display_name":"Noushin"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1457062823,"creation_date":1457062823,"body":"<p>I agree with the previous answer.

The fact that the thermodynamic path of reactions involves an activated state with a higher free energy. In most cases this is sufficiently large that it acts as a barrier to spontaneous reaction. You can get over the activation barrier by e.g. supplying heat (i.e. supplying activation energy) but this is not possible in living organisms. Enzymes act by lowering the activation energy (energy barrier) or raising the ground state (which in effect decreases the activation energy).<\/p>\n\n<p>One should realize that \"just speeding up the reaction\" is generally increasing the reaction rate from being negligible to biologically sufficient.

Navigation requires snapshot memory, learning, and attention (2-4). You asked if this effect of neonicotinoids on cognition manifests itself through other vital behaviors. The short answer, yes. Specifically neonicotinoids are shown to effect mating, queen behavior, and foraging short and long distance (5-7). It is suggestive that neonicotinoids are a contributing factor in collapsing colonies with both meta analysis and direct evidence of effects on behavior (5-8). I think you are more questioning why people have not done anything about this issue or more definitive in their action against colony collapse. That is more of a political issue. Since the pesticide does not have as many human health effects at levels that cause bee collapse, the policies to resolve this issue are not as clear. EPA has discussed making <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/epa-calls-halt-use-pesticides-suspected-killing-bees-n334936\" rel=\"nofollow\">restrictions<\/a> regarding use the use of neonicotinoids, but they will still be used.

As stated in the first diagram on the Wiki page, this is a non-standard AT or GC base-pair formed by purine rotation about the glycosidic bond and base-flipping. In the diagram I have produced by canabilizing the above I show W-C and Hoogsteen base-pairs with the difference in the glycosidic link shown in yellow overlay. Because the pyrimidines A and C in a W-C base-pair have no groups left to hydrogen-bond, the only way you can theoretically make a W-C/H combination is by ATA and CGC as shown in my diagram.

The molecule where most Hoogsteen base-pairs are found naturally is RNA, not DNA: e.g. tRNA and ribozymes, in regions which do not have a standard double-helical structure. In these case they can occur in combination with both WC base-pairs and non-WC base-pairs (e.g. the GG illustrated above), so there is nothing special about Hoogsteen base-pairs being combined with WC base-pairs. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>What I would consider important to realize is that in the context of the DNA double-helix WC base-pairs give the most thermodynamically stable structure, but outside this context, especially in RNAs that have protein-like structures, a variety of alternative base-pairs and base-triples are structurally and thermodynamically possible, including but not restricted to Hoogsten base-pairs.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43903,"question_id":43025,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43025/how-many-watson-crick-hoogsteen-triple-base-pair-combinations-are-there","last_activity_date":1457018429,"creation_date":1454629391,"answer_count":1,"title":"How many Watson-Crick + Hoogsteen triple base pair combinations are there?","body":"<p>Are these triple base pairs the only Watson-Crick + Hoogsteen triple base pairs possible?

The outcome of natural selection is that the organism best equipped to survive in a certain environment is the most successful. So, for example, thermophillic archaea do much better in 60¬∞C-plus pools of water than humans do. Our capacity to process information, use tools, etc. doesn't actually confer much advantage in that situation. And there can be downsides to that kind of complexity as well, requiring more energy and longer developmental periods. So, natural selection in 60¬∞C-plus pools of water gives you archaea, and in (presumably) the plains of East Africa, it gives you humans.<\/p>\n\n<p>The comment you quote mentions sickle-cell anaemia, which is a different example. While there is little benefit to having the sickle-cell anaemia allele in a temperate region, in those regions where malaria is endemic, heterozygosity can provide a survival advantage, and so the allele is maintained in the population. If you're someone living in a malaria-endemic region, and you don't have access to antimalarials, heterozygosity for the sickle-cell anaemia allele is arguably an <em>improvement<\/em>. It depends entirely on how you define the word.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fundamental principal of natural selection is that it favours the organism most suited to a particular environment. But, that isn't always the most complex organism. It's important not to confuse <em>human-like<\/em> with <em>better<\/em>. It isn't the universal endpoint of evolution to produce an organism similar to us, just the organism most suited to the environment in question.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, to briefly address the previous question you asked\u2014you asserted that we must be missing something from the process of evolution because we were unable to simulate it. You also pointed out that (in your opinion) we have sufficient computing power to simulate the kinds of organisms you're referring to. But natural selection is intrinsically linked to the environment it occurs in, so the simulation wouldn't just have to accurately simulate the biological processes of the organism, but also <strong>all<\/strong> of the external pressures the organism faces. I'd imagine that, in simulating evolution, <em>that<\/em> would be the real obstacle.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42053,"question_id":42050,"up_vote_count":56,"last_edit_date":1455873676},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7f09ec1f6f4ff748b51ee33a753af75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10193,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10193/vonjd","reputation":441,"display_name":"vonjd","accept_rate":100},"score":1,"post_id":42063,"edited":false,"creation_date":1452194792,"comment_id":71966,"body":"Concerning your edit: No, no, I am not talking about an exact reproduction of how evolution worked out on earth but about stylized facts, that is e.g. emergence of real innovations.

Drift, mutation, and migration will rarely cause the beneficial (adaptive) alleles to fix.

Briefly, selection will lead to adaptation if there is sufficient genetic variance in fitness, selection is a constant from one generation to the next, and genetic correlations do not impede the response to selection. Furthermore, the other evolutionary mechanisms can counteract selection, preventing adaptation. These are some of the reasons that simulating evolution accurately is so difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The reason that we can't say complexity increases by evolution is that none of these mechanisms give a consistent increase in complexity.<\/strong> While mutation, migration, and drift will have random effects on organismal complexity, fitness (thus selection) may have some relation to complexity. <strong>To evolve, some degree of complexity is required such that the minimum conditions for evolution can be met.<\/strong> However, selection should favour the most fit genes over time, which depends on the niche/adaptive landscape and genetic variation available. Selection in the <em>real<\/em> world (as opposed to alife<sup>*<\/sup> world) would, as an <em>approximate<\/em> rule of thumb, favour an intermediate level of complexity where fitness is optimised (individuals are good at producing offspring in their niche) with minimal wasteful complexity (complex structures that do not increase fitness).<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary, to answer your question, we see so much improvement because of selection, which leads to the process of adaptation, but adaptation does not equate to increasing complexity. The key to understanding your problem is an understanding of the difference between <strong>the process of evolution (change) and the process of adaptation (improvement), and the difference between optimality and complexity.<\/strong> In the world of alife simulation complexity $\\equiv$ adaptedness, in the real word complexity $\\neq$ adaptedness. <\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Good reading can be found in <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php#a3\" rel=\"nofollow\">a link<\/a> that AMR posted in a comment to another answer.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>*<\/sup> <em>Artificial life (alife) simulations of evolution generally use complexity as a proxy for fitness such that selection will be directional for increased complexity<\/em><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Just as a response to a comment you made under your question, as to why simulations don't produce \"stylized facts found in real evolution\": Scientists understand quite well how evolution works (as explained in my answer, is a result of selection, genetic (co)variation, and population demographics), however, simulation to produce \"stylized facts found in real evolution\" would require a complete and precise history of the selection, genetic (co)variation, and population demographics that have existed since the origins of life.

That's not what evolution is - evolution is simply a fact. When we talk about \"the evolution of humans\", we're describing the <em>history<\/em> of various human precursors. Evolution is basically a historical record of <em>things that worked in the past in a given environment<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most people tend to antropomorphize evolution, give it goals. There's no such thing, and it just makes you even more confused. There's nothing paradoxical about \"evolving to extinction\" - evolution is not a path from a base organism to an improved organism. It's simply a history of the changes that survived and thrived in a population. Sometimes that's because those changes gave the individuals and populations a better chance of surviving in their environment, so those traits became more and more prevalent in a population - for example, skin turning to hardened skin, turning to armour plates or weapons, or a better beak allowing it to reach into a food source that isn't available to others. Sometimes, it's simply dumb luck - don't forget that there was a point where the whole (pre-)human population was reduced to a ridiculously low number (I think it was something like 10 000 individuals or maybe even less). It would only take one local catastrophe to kill off the whole human species, no matter how \"improved\" and \"advanced\" we might consider ourselves to be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another rather brutal example would be the evolution of photosynthesis - when the atmosphere started filling up with free oxygen, it killed off almost all life on the Earth. Sounds like an improvement? Getting rid of your competiton? Well, it also fueled a massive growth of new species that were not only <em>adapted<\/em> to an oxygen atmosphere, they used it as a source of energy! Not only would they thrive on the \"waste products\" of the photosynthesers, they even consumed them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if you wanted to describe evolution as a process that improves fitness, you must not forget that a change that improves your reproduction rates in one kind of environment can hinder (or kill) you in another.<\/p>\n\n<p>When pre-Koala bears drifted to be exclusive Eucalyptus-vores, it gave them an advantage - they had a food source no√∂ne else can use. But it also made them 100% dependent on Eucalyptus. When Eucalyptus dies, they will as well. Something that was arguably an improvement can easily be the thing that kills of your entire species. It only \"improved\" their ability to survive and thrive in one specific environment - it also entirely locked them in their niche.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Evolution doesn't have goals, so it's weird to say \"evolution is about improvement\". Random changes have a tiny chance of becoming (locally) useful traits, and useful traits have a tiny chance of becoming entrenched in the population, and thus forming a new species over time. It's a history of changes, not a prediction of the future. The great thing about Darwin's Theory of Evolution is that it predicts what <em>kinds<\/em> of changes are possible (and which are impossible!) - for example, that complex systems can't arise out of the blue, or that different branches of history (\"evolutionary tree\") cannot exchange traits.<\/li>\n<li>Almost all changes also have their drawbacks - it's a balancing act. There's some great examples of changes that are almost universally good - sexual reproduction and human-level intelligence are a great example of something that works in almost any environment. But even so, there's still examples of where they didn't \"win\" yet. There's still asexual reproduction on Earth, and most of Earthly life doesn't have human-level intelligence yet.

As both a scientist and a software engineer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, evolution is not about improvement at all. It is about survival and random change. There are as many if not more mutations that are disadvantageous. But they tend not to survive.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, genetic algorithms are an attempt to use a similar process of mutation and survival of the fittest.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the first step in a genetic algorithm is to define a fitness function. This function will cull the weakest algorithms, just like an environment kills life in the real world.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good primer on Genetic Algo can be found on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>However that fitness function will only optimise for certain goals. For example, a badly tuned fitness function will end life on earth either by the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer\" rel=\"nofollow\">paperclip apocalypse<\/a>, or giving rise to skynet.<\/p>\n\n<p>In these cases the algo is not improving towards the goals you want. But never the less it improves.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another complexity is that, genetics is a very greedy optimisation strategy. Mutations tend to be small, because large mutations tend to more often move away from optimal solutions. This means that evolution can only find local maximas and will often miss the global maxima.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence improvements can only occur when there is a small tunneling cost to the new maxima.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of this can be found in mammalian eyes. Our optic nerve passes through retina and connects to the front of our retina, and physically blocking the retina from doing an optimal job. If evolution were able to find a global maxima, then mammals would have been able to evolve to have squid like eyes, which route from behind.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, had evolution been about pure improvement, then we should have evolved away our blind spot many many generations ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, human ancestors have rarely been attacked by circles and crosses that are precisely spaced apart in the African continent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Saying that evolution is about improvements is like setting up a school where there is no teaching, and every year you expell the bottom 10% of the students.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42071,"question_id":42050,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1452322029}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42050/if-evolution-is-not-about-increased-complexity-why-does-so-much-complexity-evol","last_activity_date":1456989985,"creation_date":1452074099,"answer_count":4,"title":"If evolution is not about increased complexity, why does so much complexity evolve?","body":"<p>In my <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42033/what-are-we-missing-about-the-real-workings-of-the-evolutionary-process\">last question<\/a> I asked why we don't see increased complexity in artificial life simulations of evolution.

It is preyed on by a species of garter snake. This is a text-book arms race as the garter snake is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">naturally selected to have beneficial alleles that are tolerant to the toxin<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Dart Frogs.<\/h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_poison_frog\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden dart frog <em>Phyllobates terribilis<\/em><\/a> contains enough batrachotoxin to kill 10 people. That is apparently overkill for any predator it would surely have to face especially given that the only animal alive that is immune to the poison is the frog itself. However the snake <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liophis\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Liophis epinephelus<\/em><\/a> can tolerate massive doses of batrachotoxin (although I've heard it gets pretty poorly after eating a frog, rather understandably). These two species are locked in an arms race that drives the frogs to produce an unbelievably fatal cocktail and the snakes to become evermore tolerant.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Snakes.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Modified sweat glands evolved to damage the prey as much as possible for immobilisation, partial digestion, or defence. There are textbooks about snake venom and toxins. <a href=\"http://thebrainbank.scienceblog.com/2014/12/01/why-is-snake-venom-so-variable/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here<\/a> is a neat article I found with a cursory search or if you want to sink your teeth into the topic (heh.) check out <a href=\"http://public.wsu.edu/~kkardong/Web%20of%20KVK_06b/Publications/Evolution_venom_app82.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long story short: venom sacks are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_venom\" rel=\"nofollow\">modified saliva glands<\/a> from non-venomous snake ancestors. The diagram shows generally just how modified these apparatus have become!<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yxE0e.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yxE0e.gif\" alt=\"Snake venom gland diagram\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h3>Platypus<\/h3>\n\n<p>Let's not forget the weird and wonderful monotremes. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what drove the platypus to develop venemous barbs on it's elbow (last time I looked into it it was still disputed if they were for defence or hunting). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iJhNl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iJhNl.jpg\" alt=\"The barb of a platypus on it&#39;s rear leg\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>But what we can learn from this is that venom can <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101012/full/news.2010.534.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">independently evolve<\/a>. Although the venom producing proteins are different, they produce the same venom as some snakes.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36979,"question_id":36977,"up_vote_count":10,"last_edit_date":1456975340}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/36977/how-did-zootoxins-evolve","last_activity_date":1456975340,"creation_date":1440000403,"answer_count":2,"title":"How did zootoxins evolve?","body":"<p>I've always wondered how toxins in certain organisms have evolved.

Both carbohydrates and lipids (lipids through the process of gluconeogenesis) produce glucose in the blood when energy is needed. Simple glucose monomers are quickly metabolized in the body before lipogenesis can occur.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eating both lipids and carbohydrates at the same time will decrease glyconeogenesis (because the threshold for blood glucose may not be low enough), which will allow the body to store the fat consumed. <\/p>\n\n<p>As for salt, technically weight will be gained, but in the form of water. The main role of table salt in the human body is to regulate extracellular water concentrations. Increased salt in the blood stream will increase fluid levels, and therefore blood pressure. The only effect salt has on weight gain would be water weight. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this helps for now!<\/p>\n","answer_id":43689,"question_id":43673,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1456490349},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F278S.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22237,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22237/nemexia","reputation":116,"display_name":"Nemexia"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef760e2a9a24b58476207635c21730f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":16353,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16353/mick","reputation":104,"display_name":"Mick","accept_rate":83},"score":0,"post_id":43824,"edited":false,"creation_date":1456911390,"comment_id":76065,"body":"I think the comments that applied to rocc&#39;s answer, also apply to this."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456939619,"creation_date":1456782306,"body":"<p>It is easier for the body to use carbohydrates as energy source rather than lipids.\nWhen the food is full of fat, the mouse will use fat as a source of energy and only a little part of it is stored.\nFurthermore, when the food is full of sugar, the mouse will use the sugar as source of energy and as above, only little part of it is stored.\nWhen the food ratio is 1:1 sugar and fat, the mouse uses sugar as energy source and stores fat so it gains more weight than the other two.<\/p>\n\n<p>Salt is not an energy source and cannot be stored in the way sugar and fat is stored.<\/p>\n","answer_id":43824,"question_id":43673,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1456939619}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/43673/5050-sugar-fat-mixture","last_activity_date":1456939619,"creation_date":1456417661,"answer_count":2,"title":"50:50 sugar/fat mixture","body":"<p>A couple of years ago I saw a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t8r4h\">BBC Horizon<\/a> television documentary about sugar and fat.

Again, the infrared light emitted by the tympanic membrane has to follow a straight path out of the meatus, otherwise it would be absorbed. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, see below picture that graphically shows the relative straightness of the meatus. There is some curvature, but certainly no dead end.

Other traits showing a positive correlation with age include Parkinson's, cancer, and Alzheimer's. There are two key theories as to why age-related disease &amp; decline occurs. But the key message is just because something evolves, it doesn't mean it's advantageous.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all is mutation accumulation (MA) theory. This theory basically suggests that as we age there is less likelihood that selection can remove the alleles that cause genetically determined aging. If we consider something like cancer, which is clearly deleterious it becomes clearer, though grey hair may be deleterious (reduces fitness) it is at least less obvious. If a cancer has early onset, affects people aged 10, then it is highly unlikely to spread through a population because those carrying the allele are unlikely to reproduce. If a cancer has late onset, causing cancer at 60 years old, then there is a much lesser chance it will affect reproductive success - most 60 year olds don't have more children in the future. In the case of MA the effect of selection is weak if a trait reduces survival post-reproduction. The same could be true of grey hair, even if it is costly it's arrival late in life is not that surprising.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other theory is antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) which suggests that genes which improve fitness might reduce survival. For example, the genes that cause cancer at age 60 might also make you better at attracting mates, fertilising, and raising offspring. In this case it would be beneficial to carry the cancer gene (from an evolutionary perspective). I think there is some evidence (but can't find it right now) that grey hair is associated with higher fitness, in that case it could be that grey hair has evolved directly because of sexual selection (people might prefer silver haired partners) or because of AP - grey haired people are better at other fitness related things because of pleiotropy.<\/p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question: direct selection is not necessarily the reason that grey hair has evolved, it could be because of mutation accumulation or pleiotropic gains associated with the genes affecting grey hair.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read more about <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17077/why-does-evolution-not-make-our-life-longer/17091#17091\">these theories of aging in this answer and for references.<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":22017,"question_id":20709,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20709/why-has-grey-hair-evolved","last_activity_date":1456916558,"creation_date":1408723681,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why has grey hair evolved?","body":"<p>A vast majority of humans get at least some grey hair as they age.

This is not the only way organisms can determine sexes, but it's the way mammals evolved to do it.<\/p>\n\n<p>So how does having a Y cause an individual to be male?  The Y has only a few genes (less than all other chromosomes), but it has genes that occur only on the Y.  One of these in particular, the one called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SRY\">SRY<\/a>, is the main gene that causes the individual to develop male characteristics.  It mostly does its job indirectly, by making a protein that affects many other genes on other chromosomes that in turn do the work of building and maintaining the male form.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the experiments reported by <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mice-can-be-male-without-y-chromosome\">the article mentioned in the question<\/a>, they managed to cause mice without a Y chromosome to develop many male characteristics.  They did this by faking one or two of the actions of SRY.  One of the many actions of SRY is to turn on a gene called Sox9 (which is on a non-Y chromosome), and it turns out Sox9 causes most of the things that make the male mouse form.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So the experimenters found a way to turn on Sox9 without using SRY or anything else from a Y chromosome.  This got them mice that looked male, but didn't produce sperm.  So they did something further that substituted for a Y chromosome, and caused a weak gene on the X to work at many-times strength to do the job that a strong Y gene normally does.

If the emulsion is prepared correctly, a structure known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome\" rel=\"nofollow\">liposome<\/a> forms, which is essentially a \"bubble\" with a layer of fatty molecules on the outside and water at the center. This has been studied intensely in biotechnology, because such liposomes can be used to carry DNA inside (DNA is water-soluble) and then be used to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8546385\" rel=\"nofollow\">deliver DNA to cells<\/a>, as in gene therapy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, oil, which contains <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride\" rel=\"nofollow\">triglycerides<\/a>, is not used for this though, but another compound known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid\" rel=\"nofollow\">phospholipid<\/a>. This is also a \"fatty\" substance, but unlike triglycerides, one end of the molecule is polar, which helps it interface with water. Phospholipids are the main ingredient in cell membranes, and therefore liposomes made of this stuff can interact with cell membranes. Essentially, the liposome can \"merge\" with the cell membrane in such a way that the water inside it (and any other contents) ends up inside the cell.

Developmental simplicity jumps to mind immediately. You can also consider relationship to external organs; the stomach and esophagus are lined up with the mouth which is symmetrical about the sagittal plane. Or maybe even balance; the lungs are large organs and if put to one side would likely cause locomotive issues. (Perhaps this is even an interesting topic for another question.)<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, I feel, at it's core the evolutionary advantage which led to the lack of ubiquitous internal symmetry is <strong>space<\/strong>. Simply put, there is only so much room inside an organism and every little counts. Thus, if there isn't a need for a particular organ to be mirrored about a plane then there <em>is<\/em> a benefit in putting elsewhere: utilization of space.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think a fantastic example of this is the human digestive tract. The key factor in the shape of the intestines is utilization of space, which directly affects the point at which is connects to the stomach, itself contributing to the asymmetrical shape of the stomach. One could envision other configurations, sure, and nature has. However, this configuration works quite well and the extraordinary use of limited space seems to outweigh all benefits of symmetry.<\/p>\n\n<p>To directly respond to your questions above:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Question:<\/strong> Why do we not have an even number of each organ so it can be placed symmetrically?\n<strong>Response:<\/strong> Each organ addresses (or addressed) a need of the organism.

These benefits and consequences are balanced throughout the evolution of an organism.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Question:<\/strong> If we have a single organ why is it not placed in the middle like the brain or bladder is for instance?\n<strong>Response:<\/strong> <em>I feel<\/em> space.

Let's say that there is also only one enzyme present to break down the food particles, and that this is present throughout the intestine. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, perhaps for space issues, or for reasons that are entirely unrelated to internal organs, the intestine itself becomes asymmetrical. This could be because a longer intestine is needed to dissolve and take up more of the food, but the organism cannot become longer (for instance, it might live in dead coral reefs, and the size of the hollows cannot be controlled by the organism itself, so there is an external limitation to how long the organism can become). One way to solve this would be to fold the intestine, which can make it asymmetrical.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, because food particles that enter the mouth are exposed to the single enzyme throughout the intestine, the gut fluid will be less and less nutritious the farther posterior it gets along the gut. Possibly, more anterior parts of the intestine will become specialized in breaking down and absorbing more frequent kinds of food, while more posterior parts will become specialized in less common foodstuffs. This could lead to differentiation of secretory organs along the intestine, and if this is already bent because of external selection pressures, it is not impossible that a given secretory organ will develop asymmetrically simply because the intestine at the point where the enzymes secreted by this organ are to be used is not near the mid-line of the body. <\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, if we needed to absorb substance X from our food, but substance X only became abundant in the gut fluid at a distance from the mouth that corresponds to a place when our intestine is located on the left side of the body, it is not unreasonable that development of this excretory organ would develop on the left side of the body. This could then be self-reinforcing, as a more ready access to substance X may mean that this substance becomes more important for us, and the secretory organ may become larger and more dominant, and eventually we have a large organ that exists only on the left side of the body, without ever having existed in a symmetrical form.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, pure speculation, and I know of no example of this, but it is one that is not at odds with evolution in general, and could certainly be plausible. The same could occur if differentiation of enzyme secretion organs occur in a symmetrical gut, which later becomes asymmetrical and the whole secretory organ becomes displaced to one side. Retaining a symmetrical pair of secretory organs on each side of the body, but having the enzymes work on food only asymmetrically would imply that one of the secretory organs had a very long duct and the other had a very short one. It is reasonable to assume that over evolutionary time, the one with the long duct would become less important and may disappear.<\/p>\n\n<p>A similar reasoning could be applied to the blood circulation system and any organs relevant to that.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are many examples of external asymmetry throughout the animal kingdom. Many decapods, for instance, have asymmetrical claws that are used for different purposes (feeding in lobsters, for instance). Several genera of bird lice (e.g. <em>Struthiolipeurus, Bizarrifrons<\/em>) have asymmetrical heads, which probably have something to do with how they attach to their hosts' feathers. I believe that many groups of sessile invertebrates have anal openings displaced to one side, but that may be caused by internal asymmetry or because it is less efficient to have our anus situated so that feces is filtered into your mouth again. <\/p>\n","answer_id":5760,"question_id":5588,"up_vote_count":8,"last_edit_date":1358193960},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zmAC.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9573,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9573/aidan-rocke","reputation":360,"display_name":"Aidan Rocke","accept_rate":75},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1456843999,"creation_date":1456843999,"body":"<p>I would like to add an answer here to explain how the internal asymmetry of animal organs might be consistent with their external symmetry.\nHere's my argument:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) In the case of vertebrates the important internal organs are protected by the animal's skeleton. <\/p>\n\n<p>2) The internal organs are soft matter and so their physics is very different from how they would behave if they were nearly rigid bodies.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Internal asymmetry isn't a big issue because the mass distribution is approximately symmetrical in a bilateral sense.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make this concrete I mean:<\/p>\n\n<p>a) If you should try slicing a vertebrate down the middle you will notice that the left and right sides of a vertebrate have approximately the same weight<\/p>\n\n<p>b) The left and right sides of the vertebrate's head have approximately the same weight...etc. <\/p>\n","answer_id":43836,"question_id":5588,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5588/why-is-most-life-symmetrical-externally-but-not-internally","last_activity_date":1456869819,"creation_date":1356509444,"answer_count":3,"title":"Why Is Most Life Symmetrical Externally But Not Internally?","body":"<p>Mammals, reptiles, arachnids, insects, etc are all as far as I am aware symmetrical in appearance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take a human for instance, make a line from the top of our head right down the middle.
