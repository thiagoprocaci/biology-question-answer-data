Past research on MSG/glutamate has evaluated its\n  physiologic, metabolic and behavioral actions, and its safety.\n  Ingested MSG has been found to be safe, and to produce no remarkable\n  effects, except on taste. However, some recent epidemiologic and\n  animal studies have associated MSG use with obesity and aberrations in\n  fat metabolism. Reported effects are usually attributed to direct\n  actions of ingested MSG in brain. As these observations conflict with\n  past MSG research findings, a symposium was convened at the 13th\n  International Congress on Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins to\n  discuss them. The principal conclusions were: (1) the proposed link\n  between MSG intake and weight gain is likely explained by co-varying\n  environmental factors (e.g., diet, physical activity) linked to the\n  \"nutrition transition\" in developing Asian countries. (2) Controlled\n  intervention studies adding MSG to the diet of animals and humans show\n  no effect on body weight. (3) Hypotheses positing dietary MSG effects\n  on body weight involve results from rodent MSG injection studies that\n  link MSG to actions in brain not applicable to MSG ingestion studies.\n  The fundamental reason is that glutamate is metabolically\n  compartmentalized in the body, and generally does not passively cross\n  biologic membranes. <strong>Hence, almost no ingested glutamate/MSG passes\n  from gut into blood, and essentially none transits placenta from\n  maternal to fetal circulation, or crosses the blood-brain barrier.\n  Dietary MSG, therefore, does not gain access to brain.<\/strong> Overall, it\n  appears that normal dietary MSG use is unlikely to influence energy\n  intake, body weight or fat metabolism.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":37291,"question_id":37289,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1440765568},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":37292,"edited":false,"creation_date":1440765333,"comment_id":62589,"body":"Thanks for adding the molecular explanation.

This is quite easy if you know the locus of the repeats and use specific primers for sequencing.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you do not know the exact locus of your SSRs and you are doing random RNA/DNA fragmentation and total RNA/DNAseq, then you may not be able to do that so easily. <\/p>\n\n<p>In any case I think that it is easier to determine the locus and do targeted sequencing in pooled sample, than doing single-cell RNAseq (At least if the objective is to obtain repeat length distribution).<\/p>\n","answer_id":37284,"question_id":37283,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1440767728}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37283/marker-validation-using-transcriptome-and-genomic-sequences-derived-from-a-singl","last_activity_date":1440767728,"creation_date":1440738496,"answer_count":1,"title":"Marker validation using transcriptome and genomic sequences derived from a single cell","body":"<p>I conducted a SSR marker analysis using bioinformatic tool on some RNA-seq data of human tissues.

Pretty much the only use of hyperthermia in medicine is in the treatment of cancer. If you google \"use of hyperthermia in medical treatment\", you'll likely only find two kinds of hits: those for cancer treatment and those for malignant hyperthermia (a side effect of some psychotropic drugs.) The hyperthermia used to kill resistant cancer cells is high enough to destroy proteins (~113°-114°) and very localized; your entire body raised to this temperature would result in death very quickly. Lower (i.e. physiological) levers of \"hyperthermia\" (or hyperpyrexia) would not kill the cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the turn of the century, there were many who believed in the therapeutic use of hyperthermia in the form of hot baths, hot springs, and even injection of infectious agents to produce fever(!), but the practice has fallen into disuse, probably because there were no studies which supported it.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, hyperthermia isn't good for you; it is something to treat seriously. When the cause isn't known, the efforts used to treat it can amount to many unnecessary tests and treatments (as seen in the accident victim in the fourth reference. When it's present in a moderate amount, it can still be dangerous:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When fever occurs, many physiological stresses take place. Some of these include increased oxygen consumption as a response to increased cell metabolism, increased heart rate, increased cardiac output, increased leukocyte count, and an increased level of C-reactive protein. Oxygen consumption increases by 13% for every 1°C increase in body temperature, provided no shivering occurs. If shivering is present, oxygen consumption may increase by 100% to 200%. Some cytokines released during fever states also induce physiological stress. These cytokines can trigger accelerated muscle catabolism by causing weight loss, loss of strength, and negative nitrogen balance. Physiological stress can be manifested by decreased mental acuity, delirium, and seizures, which are more frequent in children.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It is likely beneficial <strong>in the presence of infection<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heat shock proteins are one of the more recently studied fever-responsive proteins. These proteins are produced during fever states and are critical for cellular survival during stress. Studies suggest that these proteins may have anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Fever also triggers other beneficial effects, including an increase in the phagocytic and bacteriocidal activity of neutrophils and enhanced cytotoxic effects of lymphocytes. Some bacteria become less virulent and grow slower at the higher temperatures associated with fever. Increased levels of C-reactive protein promote phagocytic adherence to invading organisms, modulate inflammations, and encourage tissue repair.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In the absence of infection, there is no benefit to systemic elevation of temperature. For the disadvantages of continued elevated metabolic rate, one need only look at hyperthyroidism to see the deleterious effects, the worst being cardiotoxicity, even in subclinical hyperthyroidism, as well as dementia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular hypertrophy, miscarriage, perinatal morbidity and mortality, decreased exercise tolerance, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p><sub>Years ago, one of the most common self-inflicted illnesses was hyperthyroidism - people taking thyroid hormone replacement unnecessarily - usually because of the weight loss that occurs with elevated metabolic states. Interestingly, efforts are underway to isolste and manufacture a thyroid-hormone like substance which will cause decreased weight without cardiotoxic effects.<\/sub><\/p>\n\n<p><sub><a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment/types/surgery/hyperthermia-fact-sheet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyperthermia in Cancer Treatment<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://archneurpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=644349\" rel=\"nofollow\">HYPERPYREXIA PRODUCED BY BATHS<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1156478\" rel=\"nofollow\">ARTIFICIAL FEVER IN THE TREATMENT OF GONORRHEAL OPHTHALMIA<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2352308/?page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thyrotoxicosis in a patient with multiple trauma<\/a><\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://www.aacn.org/WD/CETests/Media/CG0205.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fever: Facts, Fiction, Physiology<\/a><\/sub> <sub>&lt;- Easy reading and informative<\/sub><br>\n<sub><a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/thy.2007.0248\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metabolic Effects of Thyroid Hormone Derivatives<\/a><\/sub>  <\/p>\n","answer_id":30921,"question_id":30824,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1440721627}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30824/should-we-induce-fever-to-assist-healing","last_activity_date":1440721627,"creation_date":1427439896,"answer_count":2,"title":"Should we induce fever to assist healing?","body":"<p>I am currently reading \"The Fundamentals of Anatomy Physiology\" 10th edition, and have found it an incredibly interesting book. I have just been reading about the lymphatic system, and the various Leukocytes and their roles. When it mentioned fever as an immune response, I was familiar with the concept: Bacteria and viruses operate very nicely at our usual body temperature, but not so well at around 39 degrees Celsius.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I wasn't aware of was \"For each 1 degree Celsius rise in body temperature, metabolic rate increases by 10 percent.

L/D should always be the last staining step before running your samples.

Because of the diversity of these systems we may not have anywhere near a complete understanding of them for decades. Some species intentionally upregulate their immune systems in anticipation of events that may expose them to pathogens. Social insect species, like ants, have evolved specialized immunities that take advantage of individual sacrifice, situational recognition, and colony health.

If a pathogen is limited to one species, it has to make do with what it has or it will disappear with its host.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References and further reading<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0092867406001528/1-s2.0-S0092867406001528-main.pdf?_tid=68a3c3a2-4683-11e5-acbf-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1439996771_063d3e737e5a00a6fada867fcc81ad4f\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Evolution of Adaptive Immune Systems<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207015035\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Immunity<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5742/1874.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extensive Diversity of Ig-Superfamily Proteins in the Immune System of Insects<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.52.040306.133913\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biology of the Bed Bugs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X07001255\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immunoglobulin superfamily members play an important role in the mosquito immune system<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":36975,"question_id":36964,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1439999896},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a24ac2ce38ca2941dc6f15859ff150e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":17496,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17496/user17496","reputation":127,"display_name":"user17496"},"score":1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1440562516,"creation_date":1440562516,"body":"<p>In the innate immune reponse, pathogens are recognized by a fixed repetoire of cell-surface receptors and soluble effector molecules.

The question is how wide is the bridge and how much flow is there in either direction. In other words the questions become \"How much flow?\", \"How meaningful the flow?\", \"How much flow back to the original diploid and polyploid populations?\", and \"How often over the last 200 million years has such interaction been an important factor in the evolution of flowering plants?\".<\/p>\n\n<h3>Examples from Rhododendron<\/h3>\n\n<p>In the following, I will give a number of examples from the plant genus Rhododendron to show how ploidy level can function in relation to sexual isolation. In this taxa, diploid X tetraploid normally produces triploids although occasionally a tetraploid or even a diploid offspring is produced. The triploid offspring of diploid deciduous azalea species X tetraploid deciduous azalea species often look very similar to the tetraploid pollen parent.  'Margaret Abbott', which is a seed fertile tetraploid deciduous azalea, has a fragrant white flower produced by crossing a fragrant pink flowered diploid seed parent with a non-fragrant yellow flowered pollen parent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our research on hybrid elepidote Rhododendron indicates that triploids, although reluctant to reproduce sexually, can produce diploid, triploid, tetraploid, and pentaploid offspring when crossed with pollen from diploids, triploids, and tetraploids. 'Phyllis Korn' is an example of a fourth generation triploid. 'Graf Zeppelin', which exhibits polyploid characteristics, is an example of a diploid offspring of a triploid. 'Countess of Derby' is an example of a tetraploid offspring where both parents are triploids. 'White Ginger' is a an example of a pentaploid offspring of a triploid. 'Pink Pearl' is an example of a triploid that has produced diploid, triploid, and tetraploid offspring from interaction with diploids.<\/p>\n\n<p>In deciduous azaleas triploid X tetraploid crosses often produce aneuploids between triploid and tetraploid. Such crosses can on occasion produce pentaploids. <\/p>\n\n<p>Our limited experience working with triploids and pentaploids as seed parents indicates that in general pentaploids are better seed producers than triploids. <\/p>\n\n<p>An interesting finding is neotetraploids can produce diploid offspring in the first generation. In general tetraploids can produce diploids, triploids, tetraploids, and pentaploids when crossed with pollen from diploids, triploids, and tetraploids.<\/p>\n\n<p>Triploids are common in natural contact zones where diploid deciduous azalea populations overlap with tetraploid deciduous azalea populations. There is strong evidence indicating there is gene flow from the diploid population to the tetraploid population in these contact zones. There is some evidence of gene flow from the tetraploid population to the diploid population. There is some evidence to suggest multi-generational triploids exists in these contact zones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Worth noting is that the meiosis for triploid deciduous azaleas that do set seed is distributed around 1.5x gametes ranging from 1x to 2x with an occasional 3x gamete. This uneven distributed splitting of triploids is what produces aneuploid offspring between 3x and 4x when semifertile triploids are crossed with pollen from stable tetraploids. Cyril Dean Darlington in the late 1920's and early 1930's documented this uneven distributed splitting of triploids during meiosis. Evidence suggests that neotetraploids can also undergo uneven distributed splitting during meiosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Darlington's history of the garden hyacinths showing a triploid pathway from diploid species to tetraploid hybrids parallels the history of the hybridization of the tetraploid elepidote Rhododendron 'Countess of Derby'.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have some evidence for deciduous azaleas that 3x X 4x can produce aneuploids close to 5x indicating that some of the \"3x gametes\" are coming from first an uneven splitting of the triploid followed by a failure to reduce in a later phase of meiosis.

First, the vast majority of responding cells are either \"turned off\" or directed to commit suicide (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">apoptosis<\/a>) by a variety of signaling mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL-4<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL-10<\/a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL-13<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_35\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL-35<\/a>, along with other molecules like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">TGF&beta;<\/a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_1_receptor_antagonist\" rel=\"nofollow\">IL1RA<\/a>, soluble receptors to pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF&alpha; and IL-6, or through \"death receptors\" like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fas/CD95<\/a> and others. However, some cells are prompted to turn into long-lived <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27158/\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory cells<\/a>, which are able to be quickly activated upon re-exposure to antigen, in many cases completely clearing it without the need for a full-fledged immune response (such as one generating fever and sickness).<\/p>\n\n<p>As for antibodies, like most circulating serum proteins, they are metabolized mainly in the liver and can be excreted via the kidneys. Their half-lives vary by isotype, but can be as long as three or more weeks.

After looking for the science there does not seem to be much support for these fatal claims. There is little doubt that giving your pet a soapy bath in the tub will help remove the fleas, they may even appear dead.  But in all likelihood these fleas are just waiting to dry out and be revived, hopefully in the city sewer.  If you bath your pet in the yard, and than let the dry pet in the yard again the next day the clean pet and clean revived fleas will likely reunite. Soapy water is more likely to facilitate removal of the comatose flea from the pet and carry it down the drain. So it is reasonable to have noticeable decrease in the flea population after a bath.

Often, you see a separation into at least six different categories of species concepts, which are then often subcategorized futher (and they can also overlap to some extent), namely:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Biological species concept<\/li>\n<li>Phylogenetic/cladistic species concept<\/li>\n<li>Evolutionary species concept<\/li>\n<li>Ecological species concept<\/li>\n<li>Cohesion species concept<\/li>\n<li>Morphological/Phenetic species concept<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Broadly, these groupings show up in different forms in e.g. Futuyma (1998), DeQueiroz (2007) and Mallet (2007). The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#Definitions_of_species\">Wikipedia page on species concepts<\/a> also provides a useful overview.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biological species concept is probably the most well-known, but is very difficult to apply for many organisms, due to for example lack of knowledge (we know very little about the reproductive biology for most species of earth), their breeding system or maybe because we are dealing with extinct organisms. <strong>Your question<\/strong> is most closely connected to the <strong>phylogenetic/cladistic group<\/strong> of species concepts, which aims to delimit species based on lineages/clades/monophyletic groups, often using molecular phylogenetics for inferences.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't know the literature of the phylogenetic/cladistic species concept well enought to answer your question fully, but I know that there exists multiple ways to delimit species within this group of species concepts. The most \"extreme\" forms/interpretations state that a species can be any monophyletic group with inhereted characteristics that you can diagnose, and this can lead to very narrow species definitions and \"splitting\" of one species into several. However, more conservative definitions look at e.g. monophyletic gene trees, where several geographic subspecies can be grouped withing the same species.<\/p>\n\n<p>All-in-all, I don't think it is possible to give a definite answer to your question \"<em>At what point does a scientist determine two lineages are different enough to be considered separate species?<\/em>\". It depends on the species concept that is used, and how this is interpreted by the taxonomists conducting a specific study. Also note that phylogenetic/cladistic species concepts are related to the idea of <em>Least-inclusive taxonomic units<\/em> (LITUs, see Pleijel &amp; Rouse, 2000), that aim to partially separate \"species\" from taxonomy and instead only consider taxonomic units, based on current knowledge.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Futuyma. 1998.

With drugs, this deterioration happens as the drug is cleared from blood circulation, particularly cerebral circulation. With the ingestion of amphetamines, there is a brief reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine. Amphetamines also temporarily prevent the 'recycling' of said neurotransmitters, so the reuptake effect can last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. The brain regulates internal homeostasis of mood based on perceived 'high' and 'low' elevations; thus, after an extended elevation in mood, there must be a 'comedown' period, or a deterioration in affect.<\/p>\n\n<p>Further essential to this idea of homeostasis are the stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. Upon release, these hormones may raise blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and/or heart rate. As heart rate increases, the flow of blood goes to the heart, with less going to the brain. This causes the groggy and tired feeling afterwards that might be associated with a 'crash'. Stress hormones also impact the thyroid (which controls how fast the body uses energy, and controls hormonal sensitivity) as well as the central nervous system. <\/p>\n\n<p>Exercise also leads to increased heart rate, as well as muscle fatigue. However, exercise itself doesn't typically lead to a depressed, lethargic state, as exercise promotes the release of endorphins (which are known to improve general sense of well-being). However, it is not uncommon for some people to experience \"endorphin withdrawal\" after suddenly stopping excessive exercise, which could mirror the crash that comes from the 'comedown' after drug use.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37119,"question_id":34338,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/34338/neuroscience-behind-the-crash","last_activity_date":1440395688,"creation_date":1431964039,"answer_count":1,"title":"Neuroscience behind the crash","body":"<p>After experiencing things like stress, intense exercise, or using drugs such as caffeine and amphetamine, subjects often assume a depressive and lethargic state afterwards, known as a \"crash.\" What is the neuroscience behind it?

Both sexes range in size from 5 to 10 mm. Some yellow sac spiders are attracted to the smell of volatiles in gasoline. Cheiracanthium venom is purportedly necrotic, and it could cause a small lesion in humans. However, the necrotic nature and severity of the spider's bite has been disputed. Because of the possibly necrotic nature of the wound, MRSA infection is a danger and victims are advised to seek medical treatment. Painful bites may be incurred from species such as C. punctorium in Europe, C. mildei in Europe and North America, C. inclusum in the Americas, C. lawrencei in South Africa and C. japonicum in Japan. Of all \"common house spiders\", they are the only species whose tarsi do not point either outward (like Tegenaria) or inward (like Araneus), and are therefore easy to identify.Cheiracanthium venom is purportedly necrotic, and it could cause a small lesion in humans.

This process is mainly used by prokayotic organisms (bacteria) that live in environments devoid of oxygen. Although oxygen is not used, the process is still called respiration because the basic three steps of respiration are all used, namely glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain, or electron transport chain. It is the use of the third and final step that defines the process as respiration. In order for the electron transport chain to function, a final electron acceptor must be present to take the electron away from the system after it is used. In aerobic orgainisms, this final electron acceptor is oxygen. Oxygen is a highly electronegative atom and therefore is an excellent candidate for the job. In anaerobes, the chain still functions, but oxygen is not used as the final electron acceptor. Other less electronegative substances such as sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), and sulfur (S) are used. Oftentimes, anaerobic organisms are obligate anaerobes, meaning they can only respire using anaerobic compounds and can actually die in the presence of oxygen. <\/p>\n\n<p>Anaerobic respiration is not the same as fermentation, which does not use either the citric acid cycle or the respiratory chain (electron transport chain) and therefore, cannot be classified as respiration. <\/p>\n\n<p>Aerobic Respiration <\/p>\n\n<p>Aerobic respiration requires oxygen in order to generate energy (ATP). Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as reactant, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown from glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondrion in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The product of this process is energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2.<\/p>\n\n<p>Simplified reaction: C6H12O6 (aq) + 6 O2 (g) → 6 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l) \nΔG = -2880 kJ per mole of C6H12O6 <\/p>\n\n<p>The negative ΔG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and the reaction can happen spontaneously; In other words, without an input of energy <\/p>\n\n<p>The reducing potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \"terminal electron acceptor\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). However, this maximum yield is never quite reached due to losses (leaky membranes) as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose. <\/p>\n\n<p>Aerobic metabolism is 19 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2 mol ATP per 1 mol glucose). They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus,more energy is released during Aerobic Respiration than Anaerobic Respiration.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37090,"question_id":37086,"up_vote_count":0},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74bcb23ef9e019ed7fe407e8bfa47f5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":15695,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15695/roland","reputation":2431,"display_name":"Roland"},"score":5,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1440320427,"creation_date":1440320427,"body":"<p>This is difficult to answer exactly since the thermodynamics of cellular metabolism are not well understood. \nThese are spontaneous reactions, so there is certainly a loss of Gibbs' energy $\\Delta G &lt; 0$; this energy corresponds to your \"energy\" term on the product side of the reactions. For the anaerobic case (glycolysis) a balanced reaction formula is<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi $\\rightarrow$ 2 Lactate + 2 ATP + 2 H2O <\/p>\n\n<p>Details like phosphate (Pi) and water is important here. Now, if we know the free energies $G$ of each substrate and product, we can calculate the $\\Delta G$ as the sum of the products' energies minus the sum of the reactants. Unfortunately, this energy $G$ is hard to get at. It depends on a number of things, like the molecule structure, concentration, temperature and the pH and ion strength of the solution. These things are not exactly known, so the answer will be uncertain. This is actually an active area of research, and sophisticated methods have been developed for calculating $G$. One of the best are from a groyp at the Weizmann institute in Israel, and is available at <a href=\"http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il\">http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>If we assume all concentrations to be 1mM, this method gives $\\Delta G = -118.7$ for the glycolytic reaction above. This is the energy lost (mainly as heat) in the reaction. For comparison with energy captures by ATP, we can break up the reaction into two parts and calculate<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose $\\rightarrow$ 2 Lactate $\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad \\Delta G = -206.7$<\/p>\n\n<p>2 ADP + 2 Pi $\\rightarrow$ 2 ATP + 2 H2O $\\quad\\quad\\Delta G = 87.0$<\/p>\n\n<p>which sums to -118.7, as expected. This tells us the fraction of the Gibb's energy captured as ATP is 87/206.7 = 42%, while 58% is lost as \"heat\". So glycolysis has an efficiency of 42%. (For comparison, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine#Energy_efficiency\">combustion engine<\/a> is somewhere at 15--20%.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The aerobic case is more difficult, because the stoichiometry is not even fixed: the number of ATP molecules actually obtained from 1 molecule of glucose depends on the efficiency of the respiratory chain, on cytosolic NADH oxidation, and otherthings. But let's say we get 30 ATP. Then<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose + 30 ADP + 30 Pi + 6 O2 $\\rightarrow$ 6 CO2 + 30 ATP + 36 H2O<\/p>\n\n<p>has $\\Delta G = -1608$, which can be broken up into<\/p>\n\n<p>Glucose + 6 O2 $\\rightarrow$ 6 CO2 + 6 H2O $\\quad\\quad\\Delta G = -2913$<\/p>\n\n<p>30 ADP + 30 Pi$\\rightarrow$  30 ATP + 30 H2O $\\quad\\quad\\Delta G = 1305$<\/p>\n\n<p>So here 1305/2913 = 45% of the energy is captured. So in this sense, glycolysis and respiration are similar in efficiency. Varying the number of ATP changes this value; try it! Of course, glycolysis can only partially oxidize glucose (into lactate), while respiration achieves complete oxidation to CO2, extracting much more energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, these values depends heavily on concentrations of metabolites inside cells, which are not well known. Try changing them at the <a href=\"http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il\">equilibrator web site<\/a> and note the effects! Unfortunately, many biochemistry textbooks present values of $\\Delta G$ assuming reactants at 1M (!) which is completely irrelevant to actual conditions in living cells.<\/p>\n","answer_id":37091,"question_id":37086,"up_vote_count":5}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/37086/energy-released-during-the-production-of-atp","last_activity_date":1440328871,"creation_date":1440287345,"answer_count":2,"title":"Energy released during the production of ATP?","body":"<p>When glucose is used during aerobic and anaerobic exercise, how much energy is expended or required?<\/p>\n\n<p>During aerobic exercise:<\/p>\n\n<p>$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6 O_2 \\to ATP + H_2O + 6 CO_2$ + energy<\/p>\n\n<p>During anaerobic exercise:<\/p>\n\n<p>$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6 O_2 \\to 2 C_3H_6O_3 + 2 ATP$ + energy<\/p>\n\n<p>For each of the reactions above what is the value of the '+ energy' part?<\/p>\n","question_id":37086,"tags":["biochemistry","metabolism"],"score":5,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":208,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1440328871},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/352620ba41c077bb6cf636b59bfd2fd3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17427,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17427/pi5","reputation":311,"display_name":"Pi5","accept_rate":25},"closed_date":1440509919,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/INPrd.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16651,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16651/amr","reputation":4081,"display_name":"AMR"},"score":0,"post_id":37077,"edited":false,"creation_date":1440269125,"comment_id":62127,"body":"I have noticed that in your questions, you are basically asking things that can be answered with a simple Google search.

Recent data in humans and mice also indicate the presence of highly localized initiation sites that promote crossovers clustered around the region of initiation and seem to share common features with sites in yeast. On a larger scale, chromosomal domains with various recombination rates have been identified from yeast to mammals. This indicates a higher level of regulation of recombination in the genome with potential consequences on genome structure...\n  ...DSBs (Double Strand Breaks) occur in highly localized regions and spread over 70\u2013250 bp. DNA sequence analysis reveals no unique conserved consensus sequences, although a degenerate 50-bp motif partly correlates with DSB sites. However, one common feature is that DSBs are located in accessible regions of the chromatin next to either promoters or binding sites for transcription factors. Based on two studies, DSB activity does not correlate with local transcriptional activity, but depends on transcription-factor binding (HIS4 in S. cerevisiae and ade6-M26 in S. pombe).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bernard de Massy, Distribution of meiotic recombination sites.

How the machinery choses the place? Once again, as the paper says the breaking event depends on TF binding. But that is for S. cerevisiae.

Also, within a 32-bp core surrounding the Spo11 cleavage sites, a twofold rotational symmetry for complementary dinucleotide composition can be discerned, suggesting separate contributions of the flanking 'half sites' to Spo11 binding and/or cleavage.

Given that it happens at this type of place (e.g. start of a gene), how does it decide that it will cut here (the start of this gene) and not there (the start of that gene)?<\/p>\n","question_id":28243,"tags":["chromosome","meiosis","allele","crossover"],"score":11,"accepted_answer_id":28335,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":274,"up_vote_count":11,"last_edit_date":1422997048},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73c3b61be18737171f3b7029b9b46639?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17436,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17436/hikari-kurai","reputation":1,"display_name":"Hikari Kurai"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":2,"post_id":37071,"edited":false,"creation_date":1440261613,"comment_id":62118,"body":"Welcome to Biology.SE!

If you can&#39;t find country-level frequency of Neanderthal, it is probably because there is too little population structure at this small scale to be able to see any difference.
