I've written my specific questions right after the text question.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. Its genome is a single (+) stranded RNA that is packaged with the reverse transcriptase enzyme within a protein capsid. This is further packaged into an envelope that is derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell in which the virus had replicated. The surface of the envelope is covered with the envelope glycoprotein, called gp120 &amp; gp41. <\/p>\n\n<p>a) HIV specifically infects the T-helper (TH) cells of the human immune system. If the HIV enters the host cell by means of host receptor recognizing a viral protein, what would be the most likely ligand and its corresponding receptor during HIV infection? <\/p>\n\n<p>b) Some individuals are resistant to HIV infection even after repeated exposure. Assuming that these individuals express a normal level of the functional receptor that you have recognized above, how can you explain their resistance to HIV? <\/p>\n\n<p>c) In recent years, therapies have been developed to fight AIDS using nucleotide analogs. The drug used to combat AIDS is Azidothymine (AZT). The structure of AZT is very similar to thymidine except that in AZT, the 3\u2019-OH group on the deoxyribose sugar is replaced by an azido (N3) group. Which process of the life cycle of HIV do you think is inhibited by AZT? <\/p>\n\n<p>d) Combination therapy is the new treatment strategy for treating HIV patients. <\/p>\n\n<p>i. Why is combination therapy more successful in preventing the emergence of the disease resistant clones? <\/p>\n\n<p>ii. If the combination therapy involves a drug that prevents\u2026 <\/p>\n\n<p>1) HIV binding to the target cell, what protein does this target? <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Integration of HIV genome into host cell genome, what protein does this target? <\/p>\n\n<p>3) The cleaving of viral polypeptide into individual proteins, what protein does this target? <\/p>\n\n<p>e) If the AIDS patient were given combination therapy, would the patient still be able to transmit the HIV virus to his/ her partner (Yes/ No)? Explain your choice. <\/p>\n\n<p>**<\/p>\n\n<p>a) No idea.<\/p>\n\n<p>b) Maybe their T-helper cells have some sort of mutation that makes it impossible for HIV to bind to them?<\/p>\n\n<p>c) I'm thinking \"formation of HIV RNA\" because in the absence of 3' -OH bonds, phosphodiester bonds cannot form.<\/p>\n\n<p>d) \n    i. It kind of makes sense because a virus being resistant to multiple drugs would be very unlikely but maybe there's some definite reason why?<\/p>\n\n<p>ii. No clue.

The auditory system works in a normal manner, without abnormally high activation.  At the behavioral level, sounds specific for a given patient evoke strong negative reactions.

This allows the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to rest. The autonomic nervous system belongs to the peripheral nervous system. ANS controls many organs and muscles in the body.<\/p>\n\n<p>In most situations, people do not know about the workings of the ANS since it functions in an involuntary, reflexive manner. For instance, we hardly notice if blood vessels change size. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is the same case when our heart beats faster. There are some people who can control some of the functions in the body and can know the heart rate or blood pressure. <\/p>\n\n<h2>Sleep<\/h2>\n\n<p>Sleep it is a natural state of rest for mind and body. It happens in cyclic pattern. This can be one of the reasons to describe the difference between rest and sleep. There are four stages of sleep. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the first stage of sleep, there is low-frequency, low-amplitude $\\theta$ waves. This stage last several minutes before you enters into the next stage of sleep. In stage 2 of sleep, you brain moves into low frequency. In the third stage of sleep, you receive more high-amplitude $\\delta$ waves.<\/p>\n\n<p>During stage 4, the delta waves account for more of your brain activity and then they return back to stage 1.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Resting is more like being couch potatoes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Rest is important for health and sleep is a necessary factor. You need both for your physical and mental activity to create energy. When the energy level goes down and wastes increase, there is tiredness and body needs rest. When you take rest, energy is restored. All the waste in the body gets extinguished. Rest and sleep are dependent upon each individual\u2019s ability to relax. If an individual is tensed, he cannot be in the state of rest. Rest is taken to counteract fatigue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source: <\/p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/when-you-cant-sleep-how-good-is-lying-in-bed-with-your-eyes-closed/262484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/when-you-cant-sleep-how-good-is-lying-in-bed-with-your-eyes-closed/262484/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>[2] <a href=\"http://insomnia.ygoy.com/difference-between-rest-and-sleep/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://insomnia.ygoy.com/difference-between-rest-and-sleep/<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":19890,"question_id":19861,"up_vote_count":2},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/58468625cf223bc2912b83cf56535d85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8088,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8088/panav2000k","reputation":1,"display_name":"panav2000k"},"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/157fc3cbff8a7b17d31d02a84547fdc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6534,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6534/coburne","reputation":216,"display_name":"coburne","accept_rate":83},"score":0,"post_id":19907,"edited":false,"creation_date":1406217546,"comment_id":29760,"body":"does the lower frequency correspond to lower ionic activity by all neurons, or the same ionic activity per neuron, but fewer active neurons; ie, if I&#39;m at a football game and everybody is screaming, decibel levels are high, but everybody talking at once might have the same lower decibel leval as 90% of people completely quiet and 10% of the people screaming."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1406179520,"creation_date":1406136268,"body":"<p>REST is not a deep sensation.

When plasmodium infects red blood cells, it consumes the hemoglobin in the cell, leaving the heme behind, which they can not metabolize (heme is a heterocyclic porphyrine ring with an iron atom coordinated in the center). Since the heme (or $\\alpha$-hematin) causes the production of reactive oxygen species and thus oxidative stress, it has to be removed from the cell. This is done by the conversion into the insoluble and inactive hemozoin (or $\\beta$-hematin). This crystalizes in the cell and is not causing any harm to the parasite.

However, wood also contains other tissue types, some of which have live cells at maturity. From what I can glean <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069110000119\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/461\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>, it is ray parenchyma tissue that is responsible for many of the changes that take place during the transition from sapwood to heartwood. Ray parenchyma is formed at the vascular cambium, along with xylem, during stem secondary growth (wood formation). Ray parenchyma cells remain alive for years after the xylem cells in the sapwood die. Their functions are transporting nutrients radially in the stem, and storage of carbohydrates. <\/p>\n\n<p>As the stem grows in diameter, there is a zone of transition from sapwood to heartwood where the ray parenchyma tissue begins to die. Before it dies, the cells undergo some metabolic changes and begin to synthesize secondary phenolic compounds (many different kinds) from stored starch or sugars. Then, as ray parenchyma cells die, they dump these phenolics into the surrounding xylem tissue, and the accumulation of these durable, decay-resistant compounds in the xylem leads to the formation of heartwood. In many hardwood trees this parenchyma death and phenolic accumulation is preceded by vessel-plugging, in which the ray parenchyma cells form balloon-like growths that block the flow of water through the xylem. So, once sapwood changes to heartwood there should be no living cells left, and the water transport capacity of its xylem is gone or greatly diminished.<\/p>\n\n<p>There appears to be quite a bit of variability between species in when heartwood formation occurs and what triggers it. From what I could see in my brief literature search, it is all under fairly complex genetic and hormonal control that remains an area of active research. I would suggest (and speculate a bit) that the trigger has something to do with maintaining an optimum amount of sapwood as the tree grows in leaf area (which increases demand for water transport) and height (which increases demand for support, or stem diameter).<\/p>\n","answer_id":1572,"question_id":1429,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1332859031}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1429/if-the-xylem-of-a-woody-plant-is-composed-of-dead-tissue-how-does-sapwood-becom","last_activity_date":1406081207,"creation_date":1331776032,"answer_count":1,"title":"If the xylem of a woody plant is composed of dead tissue, how does sapwood become heartwood?","body":"<p>If the xylem of a tree is composed entirely of dead tissue, then that means the sapwood is dead.

This affects directly muscular trophism. It also limits physical activity, this being another favoring factor for muscular atrophy and overweight issues [1]. Association of bone degenerative processes (osteoporosis, osteopathy, osteolysis) is also a factor and it is dangerous because it promotes spinal cord injuries if vertebral height reduction amount is notable [2].<\/p>\n\n<p>Focusing on muscular atrophy, here is how it can decrease height: by increasing vertebral column curvatures mostly on the upper region with articulating vertebrae. The vertebral column tends to gain a spring-like, spiral shape, associating accentuated cervical lordosis, accentuated thoracic  kyphosis and thoracic scoliosis.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FQ2Sc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>\nImage source: Scoliosis Treatment Alternatives. <em><a href=\"http://scoliosistreatmentalternatives.com/2012/05/chiropractic-for-scoliosis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chiropractic for Scoliosis Treatment Review<\/a><\/em> (2014).

The secretion is about 700 micrograms/day in a young adolescent, while in a healthy adult it is about 400 micrograms/day [3]. The deficiency in an adult person leads to a tendency of fat mass increase and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life [4]. The brain can't \"tell your body to shrink\", but the lack of \"communication\" between the brain and organs leads to less to absolutely no use of that organ, thus inducing atrophy. The lack of both external and internal stimuli leads to atrophy (in general) [5].<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gupta N, White KT, Sandford PR. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16030513\" rel=\"nofollow\">Body mass index in spinal cord injury -- a retrospective study.<\/a> Spinal Cord. 2006 Feb;44(2):92-4. doi: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.sc.3101790\" rel=\"nofollow\">10.1038/sj.sc.3101790<\/a>.

Small humans, i.e. babies also suffer under this, and solve it by having what is typically referred to as \"baby fat\", a blubber that, among other things, aids thermoregulation.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, as the human body is scaled up, the opposite problem arises: The body becomes unable to dissipate heat quickly enough. Larger animals solve this problems with giant organs specifically suited to radiate heat, such as elephant ears; or through submersion in water, as seen is cetaceans and hippopotamuses; or simply through living in cold climates, such as the polar bear.

It was established that adult hight increased by 1 to 3 centimeters for each decade until 1980 (except for the times of World War 2, which had an opposite effect in some places). Such changes, however, happened much too quickly to be of genetic origin; and are much better explained by an increase in quality of life. In line with this explanation is the increase in height and growth tempo we see now in Third World countries, clearly the effect of improving life conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, in my opinion, womens' preference for higher men can be another manifestation of their wanting simply the best male.

Actually, this is obvious from the fact that there already are (fertile) people taller than the threshold mentioned in this question.<br>\n(The only <em>real<\/em> reasons for an upper limit on human height, which have not be brought up here, are nicely presented in this video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzQxw16G9w\" rel=\"nofollow\">How big can a person get?<\/a>, and <em>those<\/em> lead to a maximum height somewhere above the 213 cm (7 feet) we are talking about.)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Some things that have been mentioned here, though true or possibly true, are not really relevant to the question:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A limit on <em>how much<\/em> taller the father is than the mother for the typical child (imposed by female or male preference) does not change the answer to the main question (direction of mean height change, if any), only the speed (\"in 'hundreds of years'\").  (This follows from the \"anchor\" comment above.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The fact that there are many other factors than height for mate selection, and even that many of these factors are more important than height, also does not change the answer to the main question.  (That is unless the other factors which correlate with lower height put downward pressure on it.  I don't think anyone would argue this, but I will provide an example because I think it is interesting:  If shorter males were, on average, more intelligent than taller males, then even if females preferred taller males (intelligence being equal), if they also preferred more intelligent males then human height <em>could<\/em> go down (while mean human intelligence goes up).)<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Of course, generalizing all of this to humans in the present and in the future (switching language from \"males\" and \"females\" to \"men\" and \"women\") is predicated on some assumptions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>that women, <em>particularly the ones who have children<\/em>, do prefer and <em>get<\/em> taller men.

This could also change due to reversal of the preference for height <em>or<\/em> due to increased preference for <em>other<\/em> factors that correlate with lower height combined with a reduction in the lustre of male height for females.  As one example, the ever-decreasing importance of physical competition between males and the ever-increasing level of safety from unarmed attack in the modern world means that height (and other measures of strength) matters less and less.  As another example, the reduction in face-to-face workplace settings, which are no doubt at least partially responsible for taller men being paid more than shorter men, should lead to wealth (which is a factor on its own) being less of a correlate with height and therefore reduce selection for height.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>that the preferences of women will <em>continue<\/em> to matter more than the preferences of men, for mate selection.  If women and men were completely rational actors, this one could <em>already<\/em> have changed due to recent <strong>decreases in reproduction costs for females<\/strong> (mostly due to <strong>medical<\/strong> changes, such as lower death rate associated with pregnancy) and <strong>increases in reproduction costs for males<\/strong> (mostly due to <strong>legal<\/strong> changes, possibly to the point where the costs for males are <em>higher<\/em> than for females).  The way women and men think and feel with regard to mate selection is very strongly biased toward the normal conditions in our evolutionary history, though (higher female investment), and are hard to act against.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","answer_id":9557,"question_id":457,"up_vote_count":3}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/457/height-and-natural-selection-in-humans","last_activity_date":1405949016,"creation_date":1325630731,"answer_count":4,"title":"Height and natural selection in humans?","body":"<p>I watched the documentary \"Evolve\" recently and in the segment on \"size\" Scott V. Edwards, Harvard evolutionary biologist mentioned the idea that humans might evolve to be 7' tall in 'hundreds of years'. (I think this may have been taken out of context... I have emailed him to find out, but do not expect a response from someone so busy)<\/p>\n\n<p>The reasoning goes that the trend in the past 100 years has been greater height, and women show a strong preference for men who are taller than they are. (Though a large share perhaps all of this difference has been due to diets higher in protein at an early age) <\/p>\n\n<p>I wonder, though, if this is only part of the story. The preference women have is not just for tall men, but for a man who is taller than she is. Likewise, men seem to prefer woman who are shorter than they are. There is even cultural pressure: the classic western image of a couple on wedding cake always shows a man who is about 4\" (to scale) taller than the bride.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, women who are short have an advantage as they have a greater pool of men to choose from. (Colloquially, simply ask any 6' tall woman if she feels her height helps her find dates.) <\/p>\n\n<p>Let's say that men seek women who are shorter than they are, but no more than 8\" shorter. Women seek men who are taller than they are but no more than 8\" taller. Given that the current average height for men is 5'8\" and for women it is 5'4\" (and distributed normally SD 2.8\") will we have selective pressure that leads to greater or lesser height? (This is, obviously, oversimplified, but it is a starting point.)<\/p>\n","question_id":457,"tags":["human-biology","evolution","auxology"],"score":15,"accepted_answer_id":472,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3774,"up_vote_count":15,"last_edit_date":1405949016},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzKwt.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8101/agha-rehan-abbas","reputation":169,"display_name":"agha rehan abbas","accept_rate":90},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Uayv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8186,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8186/devashish-das","reputation":3783,"display_name":"Devashish Das","accept_rate":100},"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzKwt.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8101/agha-rehan-abbas","reputation":169,"display_name":"agha rehan abbas","accept_rate":90},"score":0,"post_id":19771,"edited":false,"creation_date":1405731959,"comment_id":29339,"body":"my question was about the presence or absence or lateral pleurites in the 8th and 9th body segments of a cockroach and your answers does&#39;nt says anything about those and more over the cockroach species which i am studying about is periplaneta americana"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzKwt.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8101/agha-rehan-abbas","reputation":169,"display_name":"agha rehan abbas","accept_rate":90},"score":0,"post_id":19771,"edited":false,"creation_date":1405945851,"comment_id":29470,"body":"i am asking about the pleurites not about tergites and sternites. i too know about the sternal plates and tergal plates in abdomen but the description of pleurites or pleura is not so elaborate in our textbook"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Uayv.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8186,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8186/devashish-das","reputation":3783,"display_name":"Devashish Das","accept_rate":100},"score":2,"post_id":19771,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzKwt.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8101,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8101/agha-rehan-abbas","reputation":169,"display_name":"agha rehan abbas","accept_rate":90},"edited":false,"creation_date":1405946313,"comment_id":29473,"body":"No, <b>The $10^{th}$ tergum extends beyond the posterior end of the body and has a deep groove in the middle of its free end.<\/b>. because of this they lack the pleura as the upper structure directly comes down.

This division timing allows cells to synchronize with other physiological processes and with the environment. The circadian clock, which orchestrates daily rhythms, directly regulates the cell division cycle and is a major synchronizing factor [5].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Immune system:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In every single cell an oscillator goes ticking through a molecular clock operated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops driven by the rhythmic expression of circadian genes. This clock gene machinery steers daily oscillations in the regulation of immune cell activity, driving the periodicity in immune system function [1].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Glucose homeostasis:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The master circadian clock, localized in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), regulates multiple metabolic pathways, while feeding behavior and metabolite availability can in turn regulate the circadian clock [2].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Retina:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the retina itself possesses intrinsic circadian oscillations, exemplified by diurnal fluctuations in visual sensitivity, neurotransmitter levels, and outer segment turnover rates. Recently, it has been noted that both central and peripheral oscillators share a molecular clock consisting of an endogenous, circadian-driven, transcription-translation feedback loop that cycles with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours [3].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But there are others which don't.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genetic oscillators are ubiquitous regulatory motifs in the molecular control circuits of living cells. Prominent examples include the cell cycle and cellular signaling [4].<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The frequency is much lower in some human cells [6]:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>Cell Type      Process    Time\n______________ __________ ______________________\nfly embryo     mitosis    8 minutes\nbacteria       mitosis    20 minutes\nyeast          mitosis    2 hours\nhuman skin     mitosis    20 - 24 hours\nhuman sperm    meiosis    about 64 days\nhuman liver    mitosis    1 year or more\nhuman egg      meiosis    up to 40 years or more\nhuman nerve    mitosis    never, once mature\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vinciguerra M, Borghesan M, Pazienza V, Piepoli A, Palmieri O, Tarquini R, Tevy MF, De Cata A, Mazzoccoli G. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23489683\" rel=\"nofollow\">The transcriptional regulators, the immune system and the the circadian clock.<\/a> J.

So, in that context, your question is basically asking how life originated. The obvious answer is that <strong>we don't know<\/strong> (currently anyways), but I'm going to take this opportunity to describe a few really neat experiments which might give you some insight over a possibly contributing mechanism of how self-replicating molecules may have developed. I won't go over the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miller-Urey <\/a>or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Or%C3%B3#Origins_of_life\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oró<\/a> experiments, but let's assume that the early Earth contained organic molecules (especially nucleotides for our purposes). It's also important to keep in mind the immense time scales over which these processes occurred (the Earth is ~4.5 billion years old).<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyways, let's talk about in vitro evolution, also known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). SELEX is a procedure whereby an initial library of random RNA sequences (flanked by known sequences to be used as primer sites) undergoes a selective process followed by amplification and mutation of the selected molecules. This is repeated several times. As an example, this process can be used to create aptamers, which are small RNA molecules which bind a specific ligand. A pool of random RNA is passed over a column containing the immobilized ligand. By chance, some RNA will have some amount of affinity to the ligand. Poorly bound RNA is washed off non-stringently and then slightly better bound RNA is eluted. This RNA is reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR. The PCR primers contain the T7 RNAP promoter which allows transcription of the cDNA to produce a new  RNA pool. Somewhere in this regeneration process, mutations are introduced so that the new pool contains randomly modified copies of the RNA which had some affinity.

It just so happens that Bartel and Szostak (1993) used in vitro selection to produce a ribozyme (a catalytic RNA molecule). This ribozyme was a ligase, that is it catalyzed the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two RNA molecules that are aligned on a template.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/u7bzP.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Bartel and Szostak, 1993); Methodology of the selection used to generate a ribozyme ligase.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>While the ribozyme created was not autocatalytic, the experiment had implications on the origin of self-replicating RNA and life in general, which were discussed in the paper:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ribozymes that we have isolated from a pool of random sequences catalyze a chemical transformation similar to that catalyzed by polymerases. Their abundance in the random-sequence pool is therefore relevant to the hypothesis that life began with an RNA replicase that originated from prebiotically synthesized random-sequence RNA. We detected about 65 sequences (Fig. 8, pools 3 and 4) capable of carrying out a particular ligation reaction in a pool of more than $10^{15}$ initial sequences, or a frequency of occurrence of one in about $2*10^{13}$ sequences.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[...]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Presumably, sequences capable of acting as efficient template-directed RNA polymerases are more rare than this, and sequences capable of acting as an RNA replicase are even more rare. Evidently, catalysts of moderate activity could arise spontaneously from relatively small quantities of RNA (and perhaps related polynucleotides); however, a catalyst with the activity, accuracy, and dual functionality (enzyme and template) of an RNA replicase would be so rare that it could only arise spontaneously and in a single step from a truly enormous amount of RNA. The problem is compounded because two such sequences would be required for autocatalytic replication to begin, one to act as the polymerase and a second to act as the template. Therefore, an RNA replicase could only have arisen from primordial sequence pools that were not truly random. Joyce and Orgel anticipate this difficulty and propose that nonenzymatic, template-copying reactions may have had a dual role in generating primordial sequence pools that are more likely to give rise to a replicase (21). The initial pool may have been biased in favor of local secondary structure by a mechanism involving intermittent use of intramolecular sequence as the template. In addition, some sort of nonenzymatic catalysis was probably necessary for the initial copying of the replicase sequence to generate a molecule that could be used as a template, the copying of which by the replicase would generate more replicase molecules, thus initiating the autocatalytic explosion of life.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[...]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>The ribozymes that we have selected provide a new starting point for the evolution or design of RNAs with RNA polymerase and replicase activity. A series of issues including sequence-independent primer-template binding, the use of mononucleotide triphosphates as substrates, fidelity, and product-template dissociation now need to be addressed before an RNA replicase activity, an activity that has probably been extinct for over 3 billion years, can be fully resuscitated. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Johnston et al. (2001) took this experiment even further: starting with a pool of slightly mutated ribozyme ligases developed in a previous SELEX experiment, they were able to generate a ribozyme polymerase. This polymerase was able to catalyze the addition of nucleotides to a growing oligonucleotide chain up to 14 bases long and based off of an RNA template. The polymerase was also quite accurate.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4pOyy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Johnston et al., 2001); Excerpts from the in vitro evolution of a ribozyme polymerase.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the authors are skeptical of this being the sole mechanism behind the rise of an autocatalytic ribozyme:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How could general polymerase activity have arisen on early Earth? If emergence of the first RNA replicase ribozyme coincided with the origin of life, it would have had to arise in a single step from prebiotically synthesized RNA, without the benefit of Darwinian evolution. Our shortest construct retaining activity was 165 nt, with about 90 nt involved in important Watson-Crick pairing and at least another 30 critical nucleotides (23). Ribozymes with the efficiency, accuracy, and other attributes of an RNA replicase might have to be even larger than this. However, current understanding of prebiotic chemistry argues against the emergence of meaningful amounts of RNA molecules even a tenth this length (1). This difficulty is anticipated by those who propose that life, and Darwinian evolution, began before RNA. Some speculate that in this \"pre-RNA world,\" life was based on an RNA-like polymer, yet to be identified, that possessed the catalytic and templating features of RNA but also a more plausible prebiotic synthesis (1). The pre-RNA life forms presumably later developed the ability to synthesize RNA, facilitating the emergence of an RNA replicase ribozyme, which in turn enabled the transition to the RNA world.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There are other, similar experiments where people have made self-replicating ligases (Paul and Joyce, 2002) or a system of two, cross replicating ribozymes (Lincoln and Joyce, 2009). While the question still remains unanswered, perhaps from all of this you can get a sense of the plausibility.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bartel DP, Szostak JW. 1993.

As long as the container provides enough space, and the addition of any air holes small enough to prevent the ants escaping (much easier said than done); and also so you can observe your ants going about their daily activities, then it should be fine! Worker ants like to forage, so your set up needs to allow for the ants to do a spot of hunting for their food.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is possible to make your own type of \"Ant Farm\" by using lengths of wood or plastic which have 2 grooves cut into them, like the frame used in double glazing. As long as you can place the frame onto a sturdy base to prevent it from falling over; or you can use plaster and other materials such as aerated concrete blocks, better known as Ytong nests. Two panes of clear glass or plastic can be placed into the grooves and sealed. Use the silicone sealant that is used around baths or sold where you buy glass fish tanks, but do remember to let it set and dry out well, as this will allow any chemicals to disperse harmlessly into the air before you add any ants. Also make sure that you can safely access your ant home, so you can put food in etc. You can also check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQEar1JLR5E\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube video<\/a> or <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Build-an-Ant-Farm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikihow<\/a>.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2rsx3.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\nAlways try to cover your ants when not observing them to exclude light, as for most of their lives ants live in underground nests or places well away from daylight.

This process is tightly linked to the embryonic program which, in most animal cells, is a difficult program to access once terminal differentiation has occurred (but it's possible, e.g. induced pluripotent stem cells). <\/p>\n\n<p>Of note, amphibians have a unique life cycle that includes metamorphosis. It is thought that organisms with more diverse stages in their development may have increased potential for regeneration. Mammals, after birth, do pass through multiple stages of development, but these stages are largely continuous. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the quick answer is: mammalian limbs are made up of terminally differentiated cells (and specialized stem cells) with high barriers of reprogramming. They're difficult to reprogram because there hasn't been strong selective pressure to do so. Limb regeneration might seem like a great adaptation, but it doesn't seem to be that important for the success of mammals. Additionally, selection for \"maintaining a full set of functional limbs\" could evolve many different ways. For example, primates may have evolved behaviors or reinforced anatomy that reduces their risk of injuring a limb. Also, larger animals are probably less likely to have limbs removed just given their size. And if they do, it may have little effect on their reproductive fitness. A legless amphibian probably finds few, if any, mates.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org./content/110/43/17392.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yun Gates, and Brock.

There is also evidence for decreased levels of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (McCully, 2009). The classical pathway for dealing with ROS is conversion of the primary species,superoxide, to hydrogen peroxide (by superoxide dismutase) followed by reduction of peroxide to water by GPX using GSH as a reductant. This pathway rapidly destroys ROS and importantly avoids the generation of the damaging hydroxide radical. Reduced glutathione is regenerated at the expense of NADPH.<\/p>\n\n<p>Endothelial cells use nitric oxide (NO) to signal to surrounding smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation. ROS react with NO, inactivating it. There is also evidence that NO production by epithial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is affected, and Leung <em>et al<\/em>., 2013 present data indicating that the phosphorylation level of eNOS is reduced by homocysteine.

Although the precise nature of the underlying mechanism is at present unclear, our results demonstrate that physiological concentrations of free homocysteine can inhibit the efficiency of cysteine utilization by GCL in a competitive manner. Homocysteine has been shown to bind GCLc at the active site in vitro [25] as well as in vivo [35], forming γ-glutamylhomocysteine [36], which is then rapidly degraded enzymatically. An additional mechanism by which an age-related increase in free homocysteine can inhibit the catalytic efficiency of GCL in a competitive manner is described in [35]. It is possible that an aging-related increase in the competition between cysteine and homocysteine for the cysteine binding site of GCL might lead to a decrease in GC synthesis.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Low glutathione means a reduced ability to detoxify and deal with oxidative stress and a more oxidised redox state which has many implications<\/p>\n\n<p>Further reading:<\/p>\n\n<p>Inhibition of glutathione synthesis in brain endothelial cells lengthens S-phase transit time in the cell cycle: Implications for proliferation in recovery from oxidative stress and endothelial cell damage\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231713000244\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231713000244<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Glutathione reverses endothelial dysfunction and improves nitric oxide bioavailability\n<a href=\"http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1125915\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1125915<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":19820,"question_id":8327,"up_vote_count":2}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/8327/by-what-mechanism-does-elevated-homocysteine-level-cause-endothelial-dysfunction","last_activity_date":1405918777,"creation_date":1368441753,"answer_count":2,"title":"By what mechanism does elevated homocysteine level cause endothelial dysfunction and damage?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/8300/1413\">It has been stated<\/a> that elevated homocysteine level causes endothelial dysfunction and damage.

Nth and hNTH1 were found by this assay to cleave 3' to the AP site. HAP1 is dependent on $Mg^{2+}$ for catalytic activity. hNTH1 (and likely Nth, given the high conservation) are dependent on $Mg^{2+}$ for substrate specificity (Eide et al., 2001). hNTH1 and Nth contain an $Fe-S$ cluster that is involved in DNA binding (Thayer et al., 1995).<\/p>\n\n<p>Originally I thought that the reaction is stopped with EDTA.

Nonetheless, its logic is hard to completely dismiss: Once and only once chemical systems can self replicate then evolution happens - selection, variation and replication.  Dawkins thought springs from the pretty justifiable position that DNA is the center of all inheritance and variation in living things.  I'm not going to get into the arguments for and against but suffice to say that the replicator model might not be entirely true, but its not entirely wrong.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As far as the fourth step you mention, there are theories which are very credible but its reasonable to say that we are short on details... they may not satisfy and they certainly have not duplicated step 4...  The most detailed and credible theory is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">RNA World Hypothesis<\/a>.  At some stage, RNA polymers were able to self-replicate, pretty much by themselves it seems.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The evidence for RNA world is compelling but its more molecular archaeology than a series of coordinate events as we see it.

In particular the ribosome consists of RNA whose structure are supported by protein, but RNA does all the chemical work.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the odds.  The prebiotic soup may have existed for the better part of a billion years and covered all or a good part of Earth during much of that time.  As such, its exceedingly unlikely that we will be able to reproduce self replication of RNA in the lab.  Lucky and intelligent guesses may produce an environment that is just barely pre-biotic and produce a replicator, but even that seems quite unlikely.

An atom of a gas or a molecule of a diatomic gas at $25^oC$ is also somewhat constrained compared to a complex molecule like sugar at the same temperature and pressure.

You won't need a lot of mathematical rigor needed to solve for absolute entropies in most biological fields so it's best to think of it abstractly. <\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the atom. What can it do? Well if you remember from chemistry class, it can bounce around a process we call translate, and the electrons can basically switch spins. For the most part, if you had a single atom alone in the universe, that's all it could do. Move around and have its electrons switch states. It's best to think of these as \"states\" of the atom.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's see, the atom can move in the X direction and be in spin up. It can move in the x and y direction and be spin down...etc. But the point is, there is not a whole lot the single atom all by it's lonesome can do. <\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if we start adding other atoms to the mix, say across chemical bonds, then they can start to do more. If two atoms are bonded, they can stretch and contract (vibrational states), they can rotate around each other, and they can do everything the atom can do as well. <\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see, there a lot more \"things\" or \"states\" that the two atoms can be defined in at any one time. They can be rotating one direction, vibrating in one way, moving in another... etc etc...even this sentence seems to be getting more chaotic! And that is really all entropy is. Adding up more and more ways for matter to get into all these possible configurations. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the answer to your question is the macromolecule. It has tons of atoms and bonds. An uncountable number of ways to rotate, translate and vibrate, and be struck with photons, and emit light, and do all kinds of chaotic \"stuff\" (you can count it actually, it's just really hard). <\/p>\n","answer_id":19778,"question_id":19774,"up_vote_count":3},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e5208cd8d3c75254cac86325c841c96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":8373,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8373/taupunkt","reputation":131,"display_name":"taupunkt"},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1405824349,"creation_date":1405762753,"body":"<p>Entropy is a measure for the number of states accessible to a system. The more states available, the higher the entropy. <br/><br/> If you think of an atom confined in a volume V, then, without further restrictions, the atom can be anywhere inside that volume, i.e. the number of states will be a function of the volume V. The bigger the volume, the bigger the entropy. Now, if you add another atom to that volume so that the two atoms form a gas, i.e. they do not bind, then these atoms can access states individually. The number of states for the system will be the number of states of atom1 times the number of states of atom2.

The lower the pH of a solution, the greater the concentration of H+. My point is that the solutions on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane both have a concentration of H+.<\/p>\n\n<p>So even though, when NADH is oxidised, it loses a H+ to solution, thereby contributing to the pH of the mitochondrial matrix, what is the likelihood that that particular H+ will be the H+ that is part of the molecule that takes the electrons at the end of the electron transport chain?

While we certainly can create experiments where a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_white_screen\">controlled form of evolution occurs within a very small time-frame<\/a>, I'm going to assume that you're not interested in closed laboratory experiments given the nature of your question.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It obviously has a strong connection with a normal shark, but where's the \"half-hammerhead\" shark? Where's the species that only has a SLIGHTLY wider head?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The data below does answer you question, but in reverse. Hammerheads are much older than most of their relatives; so their cousins have actually grown smaller heads... but there are certainly intermediates.<\/p>\n\n<p>From Andrew Martin (1993 - mtDNA data) via Elasmo-research.org:<br>\n*The circles represent the head-width vs. body-length ratio.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZDwz.gif\" alt=\"Hammerhead taxa\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Martin's conclusion: \"...the hammer appeared rather suddenly and fully formed, and was later optimized along different lines to suit various selection pressures.\"<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I really doubt that a single mutation on a normal shark resulted in a head shaped like that, it had to happen gradually. Right?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Not necessarily. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (a.k.a. - \"SNPs\" - a change in one nucleotide) can have pretty wide-ranging effects. <\/p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of humans, for instance, are lactose intolerant in adulthood. However, lactose tolerance <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance\">evolved twice from two different SNPs<\/a> in two different human populations: One European and one African. One gene. One regulatory mechanism change. Massive benefits (essentially opening up a whole new resource in adulthood).<\/p>\n\n<p>Significant differences in phenotypes (the physical appearance of something) can require more gene mutations, or not. It depends on where the mutation is in the genome and what the gene does.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if it was for whatever reason beneficial to have a slightly wider head, why don't all the sharks have slightly wider heads now?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The simple answer is because either there wasn't enough selective pressure that the rest of the shark phenotypes succumbed to that the hammerhead avoided, or that the hammerhead design doesn't give enough of an advantage to completely dominate the gene pool. An alternate, but more abstract answer, is that there simply hasn't been enough time for the hammerhead design to dominate the shark phenotype. Remember, evolution works by generations - not years. It would take unknown thousands of generations for a weakly-advantageous design to dominate an entire niche - if it ever would.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, it is worth it to point out that evolution doesn't <em>only<\/em> select for advantageous mutations. Mutations that aren't very <em>detrimental<\/em> can still exist within a population as long as the detriment doesn't prevent resource exploitation and offspring production. Think <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001775/\">Huntington's Disease<\/a> which severely restricts a person's survivability, but only after their mid-30's (in general) - plenty of time for the person to have sex and raise a kid into semi-adulthood. It is a genetic defect which sticks around <em>only<\/em> because it allows humans to reproduce before it seriously affects them. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The original ancestor certainly didn't, and I'm sure that if it's child only bled slightly from it's eyes it wouldn't really help if much in life.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it shot something else before blood, and then a mutation caused it to shoot blood instead - but the overall effect (deterring predators) was the same so it doesn't really matter.<\/p>\n\n<p>You're correct that some traits might appear very awkward if they had evolved gradually, but the question then becomes: <strong>Did<\/strong> they evolve gradually? Sometimes we simply do not know.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So why did the inbetweeners survive long enough to evolve even more, and why did they THEN die out?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Like I said above, just because a trait is detrimental doesn't necessarily mean it will be eliminated. As long as the being can survive long enough to reproduce successfully with the trait, the trait might not be eliminated for a very, very long time- if ever.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for in-betweeners dying out - it's difficult to think of it like that. You're talking bout LCAs (\"Last Common Ancestors\") of extant (currently-living) species. While some LCAs just die out for some reason or another, it's more common that the LCA simply continued to evolve and become a genetic relative due to some sort of isolation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Think of it like the in-betweeners coming to a fork in the road. Some choose right, some choose left. There isn't anybody left behind - merely two populations that are changing over time that were once one group until they don't really mate between each other anymore (or <em>can't<\/em>). Heck, even Biologists have trouble deciding at what point a population is considered a different \"species\" because of discoveries in the last 50 years - so right now a firm answer like \"It takes 15% of the genome to change for a new species to emerge\" isn't possible as it doesn't really work like that.<\/p>\n\n<p>We'll get to it eventually, but for the time-being, it might be easier to say that everything currently living on Earth is an in-betweener of something else in the future. Everything in its current iteration will eventually die off, but not before something else emerges from our offspring which may or may not be significantly different from us due to however many genetic mutations our offspring have from us. It could be one that opens up a whole new realm of possibilities (like lactose tolerance) or an accumulation due to selective pressures (like Phoemelanin production and pale skin in humans [Redheads] to produce more Vitamin D3 at higher latitudes).<\/p>\n","answer_id":19769,"question_id":19760,"up_vote_count":7},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fe3cd7d7540ad42af0e9ab6047b0139?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":8364,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/8364/michael-martinez","reputation":99,"display_name":"Michael Martinez"},"score":-1,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":1,"last_activity_date":1405713614,"creation_date":1405713614,"body":"<p>If an inbetweener offers a slight advantage to survival, and if the full-fledged trait even more so, then once the full-fledged population becomes sufficiently large, they will have the advantage and the inbetweeners will die out.<\/p>\n","answer_id":19772,"question_id":19760,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/19760/where-are-the-evolutionary-inbetweeners","last_activity_date":1405713614,"creation_date":1405697424,"answer_count":3,"title":"Where are the evolutionary \"inbetweeners\"?","body":"<p>The problem I've always had with evolution is the actual lack of variation between animals.

I can however illustrate some of the complexities to this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly I would say that what you mean by human perception is extremely complex, there are different modalities of perception. For example in terms of a visual stimulus, we may simply perceive its basic shape, outline, colour, whether or not it is moving. We then may also perceive higher levels of information such as the function of the object. Similarly there are different aspects to other stimuli.<\/p>\n\n<p>These different components of perception are transmitted by different neurons leading to the brain and then processed by different areas of the brain suited to specific tasks and then are integrated together to give us a conscious idea of what the object is.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore when measuring the latency of human perception you would first have to decide what exactly you mean by this?<\/p>\n\n<p>The other aspect is that a lot of study has occurred in this area as we are aware that perception can be altered by states of illness (for example audio evoked responses in schizophrenia, or visual evoke responses in multiple sclerosis).

A general trend appears which may be summarized by the rule\n  \"among fish and amphibian faunas the proportion of species with large\n  adult size tends to increase from the equator towards the poles\". The\n  rule holds for freshwater fish, deepsea fish, anurans, urodeles, and\n  marine neritic fish arranged roughly in order of decreasing clarity of\n  the trend). In general the rule applies not only within these groups\n  of families but also within single families. In reptile groups, the\n  rule holds weakly among snakes and not at all among lizards or\n  non-marine turtles. Possible explanations include an association\n  between small size and greater specialization in the tropics; the\n  possibility in poikilo-therms of heat conservation or of some other\n  physiological process related to surface/volume ratio; selection for\n  larger size in regions subject to winter food shortages; and an\n  association between large adult size and high reproductive potential\n  in cold regions. Other suggestions can be advanced, but all are\n  conjectural and few are subject to test. Global size - latitude trends\n  should be looked for in other living groups.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><em>Cite: Lindsey, C. C., 1966: Body sizes of poikilotherm vertebrates at\n  different latitudes.
