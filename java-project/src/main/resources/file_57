[In photosynthesis CO<sub>2<\/sub> is 'fixed']. <\/p>\n\n<p>Even with the above restriction, I am certain I  cannnot do justice to every helpful aspect of CO<sub>2<\/sub> in mammalian metabolism, and I'll restrict myself to just one area that came to mind on reading your question: the requirement for carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate) for fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) and, in a bit more general sense, mammalian/bacterial biotin-dependent carboxylation reactions. Depeding on other contributions, I might be able to extend this a bit later. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/281/5/e5\">Salih Wakil<\/a> showed that CO<sub>2<\/sub> is an absolute requiement for fatty acid biosynthesis, but <strong>carbon atoms from CO<sub>2<\/sub> do not appear in the fatty acid product<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>We now know that FAS begins with the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl-CoA_carboxylase\">acetyl-CoA carboxylase<\/a>. Acetyl-CoA, ATP and <strong>bicarbonate<\/strong> are the substrates for this enzyme, and malonyl-CoA is a key product. One of the many interesting properties of this enzyme is that it contains <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin\">biotin<\/a>, which (in this case) may be considered a carrier of 'active' CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This explains the requriement for carbon dioxide but why no carbon from CO<sub>2<\/sub> in the final product? <\/p>\n\n<p>It is now known that in subsequent FAS reactions, a derivative of malonyl-CoA condenses with a derivative of acetyl-CoA (I am simplifying here) to give a four-carbon compound with loss of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate) is an obligate requiement for mammalian fatty acid biosynthesis, but no CO<sub>2<\/sub>-derived carbon is incorporated into fatty acids.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Carbon dioxide is also required for oxaloacetate formation from pyruvate. This reaction may be though of a method of 'filling up' a key <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle\">Krebs Cycle<\/a> intermediate (a  so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplerotic_reactions\">anapleurotic<\/a> reaction).  The enzyme here is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_carboxylase\">pyruvate carboxylase<\/a> and the substrates for the reaction are pyruvate, <strong>bicarbonate<\/strong> and ATP, with oxaloacetate being a key product.  This enzyme also contains biotin and (like acetyl CoA carboxylase), CO<sub>2<\/sub> becomes covalently bound to biotin during the reaction cycle.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Pyruvate-CoA carboxylase was discovered by <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/280/18/e15.full?sid=2034e625-3271-4210-a544-03b531e655af\">Harland.G Wood<\/a> and C. Werkman in bacteria (See <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/238/8/2603.full.pdf\">here<\/a> for a good reference on the early work on pyruvate carboxylase). Its discovery was very controversial because at the time it was thought that animal/bacterial cells could not 'fix' CO<sub>2<\/sub>; that is it was though that CO<sub>2<\/sub> is only 'fixed' in photosynthesis.  This discovery disproved that piece of dogmatism. <\/p>\n\n<p>A third enzyme that requires CO<sub>2<\/sub>  as substrate (in the form of bicarbonate) is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionyl-CoA_carboxylase\">propionyl-CoA carboxylase<\/a>.  This enzyme occurs in mitochondria and functions in odd-chain fatty acid metabolism.  It also <strong>contains biotin<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have concentrated on some biochemical aspects of your question.  The three enzymes mentioned, acety-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase all require CO<sub>2<\/sub> in the form of bicarbonate as substrate, <strong>all contain biotin<\/strong>, and (as far as I am aware) all play very central roles in mammalian metabolism.  (They also all require ATP as substrate).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Of the many interesting aspects of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin\">biotin<\/a>, I'll mention just one.  Egg white contains a protein, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidin\">avidin<\/a>, which binds biotin very, very tightly.  In fact the biotin-avidin interaction is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known.  As far as I am aware, no-one knows the function of avidin in egg white.  Some bacteria contain a similar  (but evolutionarily unrelated) protein called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptavidin\">streptavidin<\/a>. No one knows the function of steptavidin either (again, as far as I am aware). <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biochemj.org/bj/030/0048/0300048.pdf\">The original Wood &amp; Werkman paper:<\/a> was published in the the <em>Biochemical Journal<\/em> in 1936<\/p>\n\n<p>The utilisation of CO<sub>2<\/sub> in the dissimilation of glycerol by the propionic acid bacteria. <\/p>\n\n<p>Harland Goff Wood and Chester Hamlin Werkman.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biochemical Journal, <a href=\"http://www.biochemj.org/bj/030/1/default.htm?S=0\">Volume 30<\/a>, January 1936, pp 48-53<\/p>\n","answer_id":10001,"question_id":9993,"up_vote_count":23,"last_edit_date":1377474493},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1381822605,"creation_date":1381822605,"body":"<p>Some additional points about role of bicarbonate (which is directly formed from carbon dioxide as described by TomD):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Helps is neutralizing the acidic chyme when it enters intestine.<\/li>\n<li>Formation of shells in invertebrates and eggshells in birds and reptiles.

There is a small time delay from the arrival of the action-potential until the Ca-ions are released and reach the required concentration in the cell for contraction. On the molecular level there is a protein called troponin (this is bacically located on the actin filament along with tropomyosin and obscures the myosin binding site(s)), that bind calcium and then undergoes conformational change - this also adds up to the delay. After this - the conformational change of troponin - myosin and actin can bind together and contraction can occur through conformational changes. All these binding and conformation changes take a small time to be completed, and thus causes a small delay.

(Such traits could include gene duplication; body plans that can easily be adapted to new niches; learning (which enhances evolution due to the Baldwin effect) and so on. Questions about the evolution of such traits are collectively termed \"evolution of evolvability.\") The term \"lineage selection\" does not refer to group selection or kin selection, but simply to selection between distinct genetic lineages in a mixed population.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is whether a mathematical theory has been developed along the lines of the Price equation that can capture the concept of lineage selection and make predictions about it. Lineage selection does not appear to be modelled by the Price equation itself, at least not in a straightforward and obvious way, because on the face of it the Price equation only directly accounts for the relation between a trait and the number of offspring in the <em>next<\/em> generation, rather than the number of surviving descendants several generations later, which is what is required for lineage selection.<\/p>\n\n<p>The reason I'm looking for a mathematical model is that there are a number of intuitions that many people seem to share about lineage selection and I'd like to understand what assumptions are needed in order for them to be true. In particular, it seems clear that large populations are needed for lineage selection to be effective, and I'd like to understand precisely the relationship between population size and the effectiveness of lineage selection. (My intuition is that with a population size of around a million, lineage selection can select for traits that have a beneficial effect around 20 generations later, since $1,000,000\\approx 2^{20}$, but this intuition lacks a formal basis.)<\/p>\n\n<p>A literature search did not turn up anything along the lines of what I'm looking for, but this is not my main field and I may simply not know the most appropriate search terms to use.<\/p>\n","question_id":30745,"tags":["evolution","mathematical-models","theoretical-biology","population-genetics","evolutionary-game-theory"],"score":4,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/337f44cf793b4ee4ce848da801e34dd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":15107,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/15107/raiden616","reputation":121,"display_name":"Raiden616"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"post_id":30758,"edited":false,"creation_date":1427289171,"comment_id":51046,"body":"As to how humans define shades and colors is irrelevant. we can never look into the brains of an animal.

The reason is a sudden drop in blood pressure due to parasympathetic nervous system activation (<em>vagus nerve activity<\/em>). This leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, which results in a brief loss of consciousness (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/basics/definition/con-20026900\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mayo Clinic<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nThere are various types of fainting (syncope) with various causes. The type you are referring to is <em>neurally mediated syncope<\/em> <a href=\"http://pmj.bmj.com/content/76/902/750.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Arthur &amp; kaye, 2000)<\/a>. It is evoked by emotional activation due to stressors (pain, fear etc.) Stress responses are accompanied by the release of stress hormonses, most notably Adrenaline (epinephrine). Epinephrine release results in sympathetic nervous system arousal, resulting in increased blood pressure, increased pulse and sweating. It also increases amounts of blood being funneled to peripheral organs. These mechanisms aids in the <a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-biology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>fight,fright and flight response<\/em><\/a>, as more blood in the periphery allows more glucose to be transported to the muscles <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Agarwal, 2007)<\/a>. The funneling of blood in the periphery (venous pooling), however, can reach a point in which venous return of blood to the heart falls too sharply. This in turn can lead to a substantial increase in the muscle activity in the ventricles, as they are likely struggling to pump the small available amounts of venous blood into the heart chambers. The increased muscular activity in the ventricles is believed to activate mechanoreceptors that would normally fire only during stretch. <\/p>\n\n<p>Stretch of heart muscle is normally associated with a high blood pressure. The warning message of a high blood pressure by the mechanoreceptors is sent to the medulla in the brainstem, which in turn leads to parasympathetic nervous arousal. As a part of the parasympathetic response, the vagus nerve is stimulated which reduces heart activity to reduce blood pressure. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, when the mechanoreceptors are stimulated due to the overt contractility of the ventricles due to a low blood volume, they sent the same neural input to the medulla which normally signals hypertension, thus causing vagus nerve stimulation and hence a paradoxic parasympathetic arousal that results in low blood pressure (<em>hypotension<\/em>), low heart rate (<em>bradycardia<\/em>), and ultimately fainting (<em>syncope<\/em>) <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/111/22/2997.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Grubb, 2005)<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agarwal et al., <em>Postgrad Med J<\/em> 2007;<strong>83<\/strong>:478\u201380<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://pmj.bmj.com/content/76/902/750.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arthus &amp; Kaye, <em>Postgrad Med J<\/em> 2000;<strong>76<\/strong>:750-75<\/a><br>\n<a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/111/22/2997.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grubb, <em>Circulation<\/em> 2005;<strong>111<\/strong>:2997-3006<\/a><\/p>\n","answer_id":30713,"question_id":30698,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1427249104}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30698/how-pain-can-stimulate-the-vagus-nerve","last_activity_date":1427249104,"creation_date":1427128055,"answer_count":1,"title":"How pain can stimulate the vagus nerve","body":"<p>I'm trying to find out why a prompt, severe, short pain is causing a stimulation of the vagus nerve.

By varying the type of protein secondary structure within crystallites and the overall degree of molecular order within fibers, arthropods produce fibers with a variety of physical properties suited to many purposes. We characterized silk produced as a tactile stimulus during mating by the grey silverfish (Ctenolepisma longicaudata) using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, polarized Raman spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. Fibers were proteinaceous-the main component being a 220 kDa protein-and were rich in Gln/Glu, Leu, and Lys. The protein structure present was predominantly random coil, with a lesser amount of beta-structure. Silk fibers could readily be solubilized in aqueous solutions of a mild chaotrope, sodium dodecyl sulfate, indicating protein chains were not cross-linked by disulfide or other covalent bonds. We conclude that entanglement is the major mechanism by which these silk proteins cohere into a solid material. We propose silks used as short-term tactile cues are subject to less stringent requirements for molecular order relative to other silks, allowing the random coil structure to be favored as an adaptation promoting maximal entanglement and adhesion.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The linked paper contains several references that should be useful if you want to look deeper into how silverfish use silk.<\/p>\n\n<p>From what I've seen, they don't use silk for climbing.

I think not very much.  How much can it gain from having coloration that allows it to capture prey more easily?  Quite a bit.  Also, given the size of the polar bear, they will probably be generating more than enough waste heat from metabolic activity.  Indeed, if you do a little research, you might discover that the polar bear's problem is, indeed, getting rid of heat:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In bears, the basal metabolic rate varies with climate and season;\n  Polar Bear has highest BMR.  Overheat easily when running; can't\n  travel any great distance at speeds more than a walk.  Low\n  surface-area to volume ratio favors heat retention. Tendency to\n  overheat enhanced by layer of fat 11 cm (4.5in) thick.  Young cubs up\n  to 6 months old, with little body fat, are susceptible to cold.   Use\n  more than twice the predicted energy for moving at a given speed,\n  perhaps due to bulky body.   Fat and fur both insulate.   As long as\n  bear isn't exposed to wind, body temperature and metabolic rate remain\n  normal at -37 degrees C (-35 degrees F).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>From <a href=\"http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/polar_bear/polar.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/polar_bear/polar.htm<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, even if the polar bear was a perfect absorber, it could get at most ~1kW/m^2 of energy from the sun, and that only on a clear day in the summer.  And that heat would be on the outside of its insulating fur &amp; fat.<\/p>\n\n<p>So there's the answer: a strong selective pressure towards white, little or none towards black.<\/p>\n\n<p>Re waste heat: What is meant here is that when the polar bear (or any animal) consumes food, part of it goes to producing heat as an unavoidable byproduct of metabolism.  Larger animals usually have to get rid of excess heat, thanks to the surface/volume relationship mentioned in the comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a reference, try thinking about this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation<\/a>  And remember that not all answers are written down in a book (or web site, these days).  Sometimes you have to actually think and reason out your own answers :-)<\/p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Added: I think the problem with this question is the assumption that polar bears (or indeed, any boreal mammal) need to absorb heat.  Maybe that's down to anthropocentrism, since humans evolved from ancestors that lived in tropical climes, and so have adaptations (like sweating &amp; nearly hairless skin) for cooling.  But if you read the links, you discover that more often the problem is getting rid of excess metabolic heat, and most boreal mammals seem quite comfortable in what we primates consider cold.  (I write this after coming in from playing with my two dogs, who love to run around in the fresh snow.)<\/p>\n\n<p>You might also think about why almost all (non-domesticated) mammals have evolved protective or camouflaging coloration.  (The only exception I can think of offhand is the skunk.)  Indeed, a number of boreal mammals have evolved seasonal color changes (e.g. <a href=\"http://srel.uga.edu/outreach/ecoviews/ecoview130106.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://srel.uga.edu/outreach/ecoviews/ecoview130106.htm<\/a> ), having darker summer colors (like their more southerly relatives), but turning white in winter.  That suggests that the benefits of camouflage strongly outweigh any possible benefit from solar heat gain.<\/p>\n","answer_id":26264,"question_id":26251,"up_vote_count":9,"last_edit_date":1419985504},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51301603f62b97a6fecdeeb3a5d41eca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":5940,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5940/adam-davis","reputation":293,"display_name":"Adam Davis"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da1e8af33e12bfa60ea44b3af00c0d03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":5144,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5144/chris","reputation":31001,"display_name":"Chris"},"score":0,"post_id":26268,"edited":false,"creation_date":1419889729,"comment_id":42298,"body":"Why should darker fur radiate more heat?

Budding as a form of reproduction essentially partitions protein aggregates and damaged cellular components into the host or mother and builds fresh or 'young' cells on the opposite side of a partition. To begin understanding this look at <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/em> (budding yeast) which forms protein rings (from the septin proteins) at the membrane, around the bud neck which separates the mother and daughter cells <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014482771902230\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Hartwell 1971\">Hartwell 1971<\/a>. This ring acts a partition that in part, withholds protein aggregates and certain proteins from diffusing from the mother to the daughter. This protein ring is an example of how cells limit diffusion of proteins and cellular components to the daughter cell. Another good example that comes to mind is <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/8/3076.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linder 2007<\/a>, though it is done in E Coli, not budding yeast, where mother cells maintain protein aggregates and age, while the daughter cells are given fresh components and are therefore more fresh and 'young'.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now like you mention, imagine this process in a multicellular organism to be fundamentally the same. At some point the multicellular organism will start an outgrowth of cells, while restricting what materials are given to the daughter cells to maintain their youth. And eventually a new organism will have been created. Some of the details will be different, but the fundamental process is is quite similar. In that you start with an old cell that creates a new cell from scratch, but rather than splitting all cellular components equally between mother and daughter, the daughter cells is made in peak condition while the mother cell retains much of the cell 'junk' like protein aggregates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that starts to answer your question.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30709,"question_id":30705,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30705/how-detachment-separation-works-in-biology","last_activity_date":1427198058,"creation_date":1427145287,"answer_count":1,"title":"How detachment/separation works in biology?","body":"<p>It might be a strange question, but I'm interested in the mechanics of separation/detachment during asexual reproduction, for example when an organism reproduces by budding <em>(I don't mean cellular budding like baker's yeast)<\/em>.

An action potential is per definition a sharp depolarization, followed by a somewhat slower re-polarization step. The most important step in an action potential is the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). VGSCs open when the membrane potential exceeds a certain voltage upon depolarization (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095258\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liu et al. 2012<\/a>), in turn initiating the depolarization step of the action potential. Hence, action potentials are always generated through depolarization.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only ion channel I am aware of that may mediate a hyperpolarization-induced cation influx resembling that seen in VOSCs is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) class of channels. The associated current (I<sub>h<\/sub>) is a non-specific cation flux (Na<sup>+<\/sup>, Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>). The HCN channel opens when the membrane potential hyperpolarizes. Thereby it generates a relatively small positive, depolarizing influx current. it is mainly involved in setting the frequency of pacemaker activity in, e.g., thalamic relay neurons that are involved in the oscillatory cortical activity characteristic of slow-wave sleep. However, I<sub>h<\/sub> itself does not elicit spikes, it generates excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) associated with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), but not full blown spikes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1181775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(McCormick &amp; Pape, 1990)<\/a>.<br>\n<br>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Model evaluation and recommendations<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Perhaps you identified EPSPs as action potentials?

Any small perturbation leading to a bit cation influx will trigger action potentials. With a bit of stochastic leak currents included, a spontaneous spiking neuron is what you get. I<sub>h<\/sub> (-like) activity may also set the stage for your out-of-the-ordinary observation.<\/li>\n<li>Suggestion - lower your resting membrane potential to a more conservative value (-70 mV) and check the difference between EPSPs and action potentials.

CRISPR is essentially an adaptive immune system for bacteria. When a bacteria encounters foreign DNA (usually from an invading bacteriophage), it can cut it up and insert part of it in between palindromic repeats called CRISPRs. This small piece of DNA can be transcribed and then used as a template to recognize other copies of the foreign DNA. When a match is found, the foreign DNA is degraded, impairing the invading virus. Because a record of this foreign DNA is stored in the bacterial chromosome, it is transmitted to daughter cells, which will now have some protection against the offending virus in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the same vein, when certain bacteriophages invade bacteria, they integrate their viral genomes into the host bacterial genome---phage lambda is the classic example. At this juncture, the phage can choose between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">two lifestyles<\/a>: lysis, in which the virus replicates like crazy, killing the host cell and spreading to other cells; or lysogeny, in which the virus lies dormant, allowing its genome to hitch a ride in the host genome, getting replicated and passed on to daughter cells just like any other piece of chromosomal DNA.

Basically though, the LUCA is the most recent ancestor that all organisms living on Earth are derived from. <\/p>\n\n<p>Increasing evidence support that ancestry of viruses may predate the LUCA, for example an idea is that there \"was an 'ancient virus world' of primordial replicators that existed before any cellular organisms and that both RNA (first) and DNA (later) viruses originated at this time, donating some features to the first cellular organisms.  However, \"a competing theory is that RNA cells existed before the LUCA and that RNA viruses were parasites on these RNA cells that later evolved DNA as a way of escaping host cell responses.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>So basically, some theories support the pre-LUCA ancient virus origin and some support post-LUCA.

Nearly every feature of life on earth as I can think of it is arbitrary in the particular molecules.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DNA. Why only 4 bases? Why the bases that we have (ACTG)? Researchers are able to create organisms with expanded DNA alphabets even here on earth <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7500/full/nature13314.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(1)<\/a>. Even if you believe that some form of molecular mechanism of heredity is a requirement for life, there is no reason it need be DNA. And while there has been plenty of controversy about arsenic-based life here on Earth, I don't see why there couldn't be arsenic-based life elsewhere.<\/li>\n<li>Ribosomes. Why a combination of RNA and protein? There is a lot in the overall architecture of ribosomes that is locked in due to historical/evolutionary contingency, not any necessary feature of life.<\/li>\n<li>The Central Dogma. Biology as we know it has certainly made great use of the ability to make temporary copies of messages, but I don't see why life orbiting Alpha Centauri would have to have arrived at a similar solution.<\/li>\n<li>Phospholipid membranes. You could make the argument that some degree of compartmentalization is necessary for life to occur (to reduce complexity and allow evolution via drift and small-number effects to generate change), but I don't think they need to be phospholipids. I can also imagine all life on another planet contained within viral-like particles with purely protein (or some other alien polymer) coats.<\/li>\n<li>Genes. Depending on the level one is arguing I can see this going either way. If a gene is just a modular set of instructions for a limited number of components, then perhaps this will show up everywhere---life on our planet is surprisingly modular, and it is hard to imagine life on another planet being able to get by without some modularity (though of course it is possible in principle). But certainly nothing is inevitable about the details of gene organization into promoters, coding regions (why a 3-base code?), introns and exons (I'm still surprised these exist on our <em>own<\/em> planet), operons, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I think you get the idea.

Hairy skin, such as that encountered on the arm, contains at least four specialized mechanoreceptors, namely Pacinian corpuscles, hair follicle receptors, Ruffini endings and tactile discs. They can be roughly distinguished by their adaptation rates, namely fast adapting (Pacinian corpuscles and hair follicle receptors) and slowly adapting (Ruffini endings and tactile discs). Rapidly adapting receptors generate robust responses to vibratory stimuli, but respond weakly to static pressures. The opposite is true for slowly adapting receptors <a href=\"https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/9626/file_1.pdf?sequence=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Kaczmarek et al., 1991)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, the static pressure is faithfully registered by static pressure receptors, while the phasic receptors are specialized in vibratory perceptions. <\/p>\n\n<p>Static receptors fire a continuous train upon a continuous pressure stimulus, phasic receptors do so only at the start and the end of a static pressure stimulus. Hence, when there is a fast vibrating stimulus (say 200 Hz), then the phasic receptors will <em>also<\/em> fire action potentials each time at onset and offset of a pressure phase, thereby faithfully representing the stimulus. Here follows a picture of various skin receptors and their responses to a static pressure stimulus.

Another factor is that commercial fruit is often treated with growth-enhancers such as gibberellins (or was, back when I was a farm worker), which adds watery size at the expense of flavor."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":30633,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11736,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11736/jamesqf","reputation":401,"display_name":"jamesqf"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1426976949,"comment_id":50755,"body":"@jamesqf Fair point, updated."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8debbb66e700fbf086da321417bbb0a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":14767,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14767/akaltar","reputation":101,"display_name":"akaltar"},"score":0,"post_id":30633,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11736,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11736/jamesqf","reputation":401,"display_name":"jamesqf"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1426978178,"comment_id":50759,"body":"@jamesqf Can confirm this, working with watermelons.

Check <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> wiki page if you're not familiar with. Now this happens because the lens in the objective has different refractive properties for different wavelengths or if go the other way around different wavelengths refract differently within the same material. This is why the famous triangular rainbow prism is capable of separating the sunlight to rainbow. So back to the question: in our eye there is the eye lens that is responsible for focusing. Let's assume that it is homogenous enough. So when light enters into our lens it refracts to separate colours and our lens is not complex enough to fully compensate for this.

Transcription interference occurs between genes in close adjacency to each other. This is basically, as the term suggest, that the neighbouring genes can interfere with each others transcription (by overlapping promoters blocking transcription initiation, collision of transcription machinery on 3' ends etc). In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22783276\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> article all of this is well explained along with a theoretical model called Transcription Interference network.<\/p>\n\n<p>So a switch mentioned in the question can be carried out by this mechanism. Let's take two genes (A and B) that exhibit this transcrigption interference phenomena. Also let's imagine a gene orientation where the tow genes face each other with their 3' ends like in the picture below ( part B3 but with smaller overlap at the 3' ends). The setup is that gene A is 'stronger' than gene B ( has higher transcription initiation rate), thus at the 3' prime ends it can suppress gene by knockin off the polymerase (there are many possible scenarios when two RNAP-s collide or meet one knocking off the other is just one of them). Now if gene A's activity were to be lowered then gene B could over take and nullify gene A with the same mechanism seen before. In this case transcription initiation would still occur on gene A but it could not produce viable RNA because transcription would terminate early.

Gene expression are regulated through complex interactions. The concentration of enhancers and repressors is an important aspect that dictate the level of expression of a given gene. These concentrations can take different value on a continuous scale.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imagine a case where fitness is maximized when a given gene produce <code>n<\/code> proteins per minute if the concentration of a given protein is greater than <code>x<\/code>. If the concentration of the protein was to be lower than <code>x<\/code>, then the gene should not be expressed (0 proteins per minute are produced). In such case, it would be great if a bunch of reactants were to be able to simulate a \"switch function\" that would switch from \"NO EXPRESSION\" to \"EXPRESSION\" at <code>x<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that such switch function should be very complicated to evolve. I would suspect that all chemical reactions, including the binding of enhancer to promoter region should follow the law of Michaelis-Menten and the Michaelis-Menten function is not at all switch function. So, I have been thinking about cooperative binding. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_(biochemistry)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hill's equation<\/a> describes a function that is effectively a switch function given that the hill coefficient is high enough. However, seeking a bit in the literature, it's seems that the Hill coefficient never really overpass 3 (or 5 for extreme estimates). A Hill coefficient of within this range gives a logistic function but still looks quite suboptimal compared to what a perfect switch function could do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there switch functions in molecular genetics that could translate a concentration into a TRUE/FALSE signal?\nHow well do they simulate the perfect switch function?\nAre they based on cooperative binding or on some other mechanism?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>References for estimate of Hill coefficients:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435008/pdf/biophysj00200-0109.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435008/pdf/biophysj00200-0109.pdf<\/a><\/sub><\/li>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1983.23283172857.x/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1983.23283172857.x/abstract<\/a><\/sub><\/li>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/93/19/10078.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pnas.org/content/93/19/10078.short<\/a> <\/sub><\/li>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8816754\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8816754<\/a> <\/sub><\/li>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/11/11/835.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fasebj.org/content/11/11/835.short<\/a> <\/sub><\/li>\n<li><sub><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816740/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816740/<\/a><\/sub><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","question_id":30588,"tags":["genetics","molecular-biology","molecular-genetics","gene-expression"],"score":6,"accepted_answer_id":30592,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1426851083},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e18a961241ff4ca7b71fde3bcbbc8d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10043,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10043/user2030378","reputation":11,"display_name":"user2030378"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MUb2.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1306,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1306/terdon","reputation":9339,"display_name":"terdon","accept_rate":73},"score":0,"post_id":23682,"edited":false,"creation_date":1415113310,"comment_id":37364,"body":"That depends on how you define a hit.

We, the authors, and probably many readers were taught that animals do not photosynthesize.

CSF - Cytostatic factor that inhibits APC/C <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Only when MPF is present, stabilized by CSF, and active will the M phase persist.

Between 4 and 7h after fusion, the two sets of haploid chromosomes each become surrounded by distinct mem- branes and are now known as pronuclei (see Fig. d). The male is usually the larger of the two. Both pronuclei contain several nucleoli. During the next few hours, each pronucleus gradually moves from its subcortical position to a more central and adjacent cytoplasmic position. During this period, the haploid chromosomes synthesize DNA in preparation for the first mitotic division, which occursabout 18\u201324h after gamete fusion. The pronuclear membranes around the reduplicated sets of parental chromo- somes break down (see Fig. e), the mitotic metaphase spindle forms and the chromosomes assume their positions at its equator. The final phase of fertilization has been achieved: syngamy (or coming together of the gametic chromosomes) has occurred. Immediately the first mitotic anaphase and telophase are completed, the cleavage furrow forms, and the one-cell zygote becomes a two-cell conceptus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":30574,"question_id":30437,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1426782630}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30437/when-is-the-second-polar-body-extruded-from-the-egg-nucleus","last_activity_date":1426782630,"creation_date":1426354289,"answer_count":3,"title":"When is the second polar body extruded from the egg nucleus?","body":"<p>When does the second polar body gets expelled from the egg nucleus during oogenesis ?

One of the examples used to support the statement that modern humans are \"wimps\" is a study of ancient fossilized footprints from Australia, which claim that the individuals making the footprints were running close to Olympic record times. The footprint studies (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248407000322\">Webb, 2007<\/a>) basically attempts to describe the humans that have created the footprint paths, and also tries to calculate the speeds they were running at. For one of the individuals (T8), the estimated running speed is 37 km/h (i.e. 10.3 m/s). The interpretation by Peter McAllister in his book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0733623913\">Manthropology<\/a> seems to be (I haven't read the book) that these barefoot individuals running on mud could easily have outrun current day sprinters, especially with training and on a rubber track (also see this <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-mcallister/pre-modern-man_b_836265.html\">huffintonpost article<\/a> on the book). If the estimates in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248407000322\">Webb (2007)<\/a> are close to accurate, it would seem that modern top-trained athletes might not have reached the edge of what is humanly possible when it comes to top speeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is also a biomechanical study on potential human running speeds (<a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/108/4/950.full-text.pdf+html\">Weyand et al., 2010) <\/a>that you will probably find interesting. This paper looks at factors such as gait, stance, force application etc, and includes empirically estimated values from 10 subjects to discuss the limits to human speed. They conclude that (natural) human speeds are likely to be limited to ~50 km/h (as reference: <a href=\"http://io9.com/the-physics-of-usain-bolts-world-record-100-meter-dash-924744818\">Bolt's top speed<\/a> during his 9.58 WR was ~44 km/h).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consequently, human running speeds in excess of 50 km/h are likely to be limited to the\n  realms of science fiction and, not inconceivably, gene doping.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>They also look at different scenarios and e.g. point out how important limb length is for top speed: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Second, limbs lengthened through evolution or perhaps prosthetically could\n  substantially increase the top running speed attained at the minimum period of foot-ground force application. For example, a relatively small increase in leg length of 10 cm would\n  increase contact lengths by 9 cm and the top speeds of the subjects tested here from 9.1 to 9.8 m/s.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In general, important factors for maximum speed in animals are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_reaction_force\"><em>ground  reaction force<\/em><\/a> and <em>ground contact time<\/em>. An earlier study by <a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/89/5/1991\">Weyand et al. (2002)<\/a> also show how faster human runners in general have shorter ground contact times compared to slower runners. As a sidenote, this seems to be in contrast to cheetahs, which have longer ground contact times than greyhounds, while still being much faster (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723482\">Hudson et al. 2012<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rvc.ac.uk/SML/Projects/CheetahGalloping.cfm\">popular summary<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>View these as a couple of interesting examples and a starting point.

All blood flows in the body can change at any time(more or less).<\/p>\n\n<p>If the heart rate and blood pressure, etc, is constant the amount of blood that travels through the aorta is constant, yes. But there is far more capacity in the arterial and venous systems for the actual amount of blood flow there normally is. Veins and arteries contract and expand to route blood flow to different parts of the body, so the amount of blood flowing through any particular artery can change without changing the aortic flow. <\/p>\n\n<p>A good example of this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vasomotion<\/a>. It happens all the time in your hands (sometimes it's even visible as patches of red/white skin. On my hands they're a little smaller than the head of a thumbtack) on the order of minutes. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">fMRI<\/a> is a neat technology based around watching brain blood vessel changes in flow as a proxy for activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the flows through all your arteries don't even have to sum to the aortic flow, due to compliance(a fluid dynamics term. essentially, the aorta or other arteries/veins can 'inflate' so more blood is flowing in than is flowing out. Then later they 'deflate' and more blood flows out than in. Arteries tend to be more compliant because they have to be springier to deal with heartbeat). There are also osmotic effects where fluid leaves the arteries and becomes lymph, which then later drains back into veins. It's not a huge effect but it's there. If you measure total blood flow through the aorta and then total blood flow through all the capillaries, there will be less total blood flowing through the capillaries. Not much less( 10% at the most) depending on blood salt and blood vessel position and whether you count the kidneys, etcetera etcetera.<\/p>\n\n<p>So: the amount of blood that passes through a given artery given the aortic blood flow is not fixed. The amount of blood that passes through all arteries given the aortic blood flow is much closer to fixed, but even that can be different(even if you're not bleeding). And if you were asking if the amount of blood that flows through the aorta is constant, that's absolutely not true. That can vary through the heart rate, the contractility of the heart, the venous return pressure, the overall blood pressure, and a bunch of other things that very slightly affect flow rates.<\/p>\n","answer_id":30525,"question_id":30519,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3hE.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":3703,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3703/inf3rno","reputation":2903,"display_name":"inf3rno","accept_rate":50},"score":3,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1426698869,"creation_date":1426669899,"body":"<p>It is ofc. not true, because it is not a closed system.

If you're interested in only the end product pf folding -- the 3D structure, then this is the subset of the folding problem called the structure prediction (from sequence alone). <\/p>\n\n<p>a. We can verify the structure experimentally by determining the 3D structures by NMR or crystallography. In fact, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP\" rel=\"nofollow\">CASP<\/a> competition withholds newly solved structures and see which algorithm comes out the closest to the experimental structure.<\/p>\n\n<p>b. Based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfinsen%27s_dogma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anfinsen's hypothesi<\/a>s, we can calculate the free energy of folding, and the structure that has the lowest energy among the assembles is probably (but not necessarily) the folded state.<\/p>\n\n<p>B. If you're also interested in how exactly the protein folds, including its folding rate, plausible intermediates etc.:<\/p>\n\n<p>a. You can experimentally determine the folding rate although the computed folding rate is often off by several order of magnitude.<\/p>\n\n<p>b. Some interactions, esp non-native interactions (aka. interactions between amino acids that are only observed during folding but not in the final folded structure) can be verified by carefully designed NMR experiment.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>1b.

A number of studies show different cancers may have their metastatic potential reduced, or become apoptotic through targeting or abrogation of ROR1 (1-3). ROR1 itself is show to have a number interactions (either through crosstalk or interaction) with some known tumorigenic markers; these include c-Met, PI3K, Akt, Wnt5a, EGF, c-Src (4-7). In terms of metastatic potential, interactions with vimentin, Snail/Slug, cadherins, ß-catenin, and CXCR4/CXCL12 were also identified (1, 8). Some of these are via expression of CREB. In terms of ROR1 is tissue, abnormalities that lead to death were noted in newborn mice that has ROR1 knocked down (9). A notable mechanism for ROR1 in development was in neuroprogenitor cells in which ROR1 regulation status determined whether these cells differentiated into neurons or not (10). It's also found that neural, heart, lung and kidney tissue in adults express some form or another of ROR1 (11). More recent studies suggest ROR1 downmodulation may present toxicity for some subsets of normal tissues (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702778\" rel=\"nofollow\">12<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>The question, now: Are there any empirical studies that illuminate the potential mechanism of ROR1 in healthy, adult tissues? This is from a treatment toxicity standpoint, since the subsets of affected cells seem to be rather slim. I can understand why the effect on metastatic potential can be significant from the fetal neural cortex development (the need to migrate the neurons into position). We also see a truncated version of ROR1 in some instances. If anyone can shed some light, thank you in advance!<\/p>\n\n<p>References<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cui B. et al.

Clues to solve this mystery began to appear in the 1980s and 1990s. <\/p>\n\n<p>During the 1980s and into the 1990s, paleontologists discovered several fossils that were clearly land-based mammals but shared many skeletal features with cetaceans. These fossils, including <em>Pakicetus<\/em> [(Gingerich et al. 1983)] and <em>Rodhocetus<\/em> <a href=\"http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/62571/368844a0.pdf?sequence=1\">(Gingerich et al. 1994)<\/a>, shared skeletal features that are unique to whales and to the <a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/artio/artiodactyla.html\">Artiodactyla<\/a>, commonly known as the even-toed mammals. Artiodactyls includes deer, sheep, pigs, bison, and hippopotamuses. Artiodactyls and the fossil whales share a unique skeletal feature of the ankle called an astrogalus, shown in the picture below. The astragalus is a \"double pulley\" structure that contributes to the ankle joint. This picture is taken from an excellent summary of whale evolution, provided by the <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03\">Understanding Evolution<\/a> site hosted by University of California at Berkeley. The astragalus is not present in other mammals.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2dvlm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The fossil whales and modern cetaceans also share unique features of the skull around the area of the ear, called a tympanic bulla. Although all mammals have bullae (plural of bulla), the bullae of cetaceans and the whale fossils is unique compared to other mammals. For more on the bulla, see this <a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/features/whales/\">Talk Origins page<\/a>. More on fossil whales can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/cetacea/cetacean.html\">Berkeley Comparative Museum of Paleontology<\/a>. The many fossils that have been found are <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/lines_03\">transitional forms<\/a> that link artiodactyls and modern cetaceans.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TovuG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/02/07/what-does-a-whales-ear-look-li/\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Around the same time as the fossil discoveries, genetic analysis added additional evidence supporting a relationship between the artiodactyls and cetaceans <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/30018105_Revised_phylogeny_of_whales_suggested_by_mitochondrial_ribosomal_DNA_sequences/file/79e41509811cc6ad26.pdf\">(Milinkovitch et al. 1993)<\/a>. Although early genetic analytical techniques were not as robust as they are today, many genetic studies have since supported and refined the conclusions of Milinkovitch et al. Current evidence shows that the closest <em>living<\/em> relative of cetaceans are the hippos (see, for example <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/7665216_A_complete_phylogeny_of_the_whales_dolphins_and_even-toed_hoofed_mammals_(Cetartiodactyla)/file/3deec521e33865a8e0.pdf\">Price et al. 2005<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/5262443_The_phylogeny_of_Cetartiodactyla_the_importance_of_dense_taxon_sampling_missing_data_and_the_remarkable_promise_of_cytochrome_b_to_provide_reliable_species-level_phylogenies/file/60b7d518fb5d130590.pdf\">Agnarsson and May-Collado 2008<\/a>). The relationships are shown below in this figure from the Agnarsson and May-Collado paper. The dark lines are the artiodactyls and cetaceans, formally called the Cetartiodactyla.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qOk2R.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The question remains: why? The most likely explanation is that cetaceans evolved to exploit an unfilled <a href=\"http://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=4&amp;secNum=7\">ecological niche<\/a> or adapted to new niches that formed as a result of plate tectonics or other types of environmental changes that occurred <a href=\"http://www.scotese.com/newpage9.htm\">50-55 million years ago<\/a>. The niche describes all of the living and non-living resources needed by an organism to survive. Although land-based mammals were increasing in diversity, few or none were present in the oceans. The basic hypothesis is that the early whale-like artiodactyls, like <em>Indohyus<\/em> and <em>Pakicetus<\/em> were land-based (terrestrial) mammals that spent most of their time near the water's edge. Over time, they adapted to the niches in the ocean. Fossils like <em>Ambulcetus<\/em> and <em>Rodhocetus<\/em> showed clear <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03\">evidence of swimming ability<\/a>, with flattened tails and the enlarged rear feet. In addition, the nostrils shifted from the front of the face to the top of the head, which we recognize as the blowhole. <\/p>\n\n<p>The shift to the aquatic habitat allowed these species to exploit resources that were not available to land-based mammals, thereby reducing <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/species-interactions-and-competition-102131429\">competition<\/a> for the resources. Reduced competition allows more individuals to survive and reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similar scenarios are very likely for other marine mammals, such as seals or manatees. They evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were not filled by other organisms. This basic concept, evolving to fill available niches, is a common outcome of the evolutionary process. <\/p>\n\n<p>The of adaptation of cetaceans and other mammals to the oceans may be similar to that of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus\">hippopotamus<\/a>. Hippos spend most of their time in the water, and they show many adaptations that allow them to live in the aquatic environment.  The eyes and nostrils of the hippo are high on the head, which allows them to remain almost entirely submerged but still see and smell, as shown below.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pAWv9.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n(Hippo photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johanneslundberg/\">Johannes Lunberg<\/a>, Flickr Creative Commons.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Hippos feed underwaters, they are heavy enough to walk on the bottom of the river, and the mate and give birth underwater. The young can suckle underwater. Clearly, hippos seem to be another mammal that is \"returning to water.\" Similar types of processes must have occurred in cetaceans for them to adapt to the marine habitat. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Agnarsson, I. and L.J.
