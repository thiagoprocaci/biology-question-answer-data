Don't up-vote me, i just thought this text offers a good, up-to-date explanation.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Mechanism of V(D)J Recombination<\/strong><\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rearrangement of Ig and TCR genes represents a special kind of non-homologous DNA recombination \n  event, mediated by the coordinated activities of several \n  enzymes, some of which are found only in developing \n  lymphocytes, whereas others are ubiquitous DNA double-stranded break repair (DSBR) enzymes<\/strong>.Although \n  the mechanism of V(D)J recombination is fairly well \n  understood and will be described here, how exactly \n  specific loci are made accessible to the machinery \n  involved in recombination remains to be determined. \n  It is likely that the accessibility of the Ig and TCR loci to \n  the enzymes that mediate recombination is regulated \n  in developing B and T cells by several mechanisms, \n  including epigenetic alterations in chromatin structure \n  and DNA as discussed earlier, and basal transcriptional \n  activity in the gene loci.\n  The process of V(D)J recombination can be divided \n  into four distinct events that flow sequentially from one \n  to the next (Fig. 8-10):<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1. Synapsis<\/strong>: Portions of the chromosome on which the \n  antigen receptor gene is located are made accessible \n  to the recombination machinery. Two selected coding segments and their adjacent RSSs are brought \n  together by a chromosomal looping event and held \n  in position for subsequent cleavage, processing, and \n  joining.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>2. Cleavage<\/strong>: Double-stranded breaks are enzymatically generated at RSS-coding sequence junctions \n  by machinery that is lymphoid specific. Two proteins encoded by lymphoid-specific genes, called \n  recombination-activating gene 1and recombination-activating gene 2(RAG1and RAG2), form \n  a  complex, containing two molecules of each protein, \n  that plays an essential role in V(D)J recombination. \n  The Rag-1/Rag-2complex is also known as the V(D)J \n  recombinase.The Rag-1 protein, in a manner similar to a restriction endonuclease, recognizes the DNA \n  sequence at the junction between a heptamer and a \n  coding segment and cleaves it, but it is enzymatically \n  active only when complexed with the Rag-2 protein. \n  The Rag-2 protein may help link the Rag-1/Rag-2 tetramer to other proteins, including accessibility factors that bring these proteins to specific open receptor \n  gene loci at specific times and at defined stages of lymphocyte development. Rag-1 and Rag-2 contribute to \n  holding together gene segments during the process of \n  chromosomal folding or synapsis. Rag-1 then makes \n  a nick (on one DNA strand) between the coding end \n  and the heptamer. The released 3\u2032OH of the coding \n  end then attacks a phosphodiester bond on the other \n  DNA strand, forming a covalent hairpin. The signal \n  end (including the heptamer and the rest of the RSS) \n  does not form a hairpin and is generated as a blunt \n  double-stranded DNA terminus that undergoes no \n  further processing. This double-stranded break results \n  in a closed hairpin of one coding segment being held \n  in apposition to the closed hairpin of the other coding end and two blunt recombination signal ends being placed next to each other. Rag-1 and Rag-2, apart \n  from generating the double-stranded breaks, also hold \n  the hairpin ends and the blunt ends together before \n  the modification of the coding ends and the process of \n  ligation.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>RAGgenes are lymphoid specific and are expressed \n  only in developing B and T cells. Rag proteins are \n  expressed mainly in the G0and G1\n  stages of the cell \n  cycle and are inactivated in proliferating cells. It is \n  thought that limiting DNA cleavage and recombination \n  to the G\n  0 and G1\n  stages minimizes the risk of generating inappropriate DNA breaks during DNA replication or during mitosis. Mice without functional Rag1\n  or Rag2genes (Ragknockout mice) fail to develop B or \n  T lymphocytes, and Rag-1 or Rag-2 deficiency is also \n  a rare cause of SCID, in which patients also lack all \n  lymphocytes.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>3. Hairpin opening and end-processing<\/strong>: The broken \n  coding ends are modified by the addition or removal \n  of bases, and thus greater diversity is generated. After the formation of double-stranded breaks, hairpins must be resolved (opened up) at the coding \n  junctions, and bases may be added to or removed \n  from the coding ends to ensure even greater diversification. Artemisis an endonuclease that opens \n  up the hairpins at the coding ends. In the absence \n  of Artemis, hairpins cannot be opened, and mature \n  T and B cells cannot be generated. Mutations in \n  ARTEMIS are a rare cause of SCID, similar to patients with RAG1or RAG2mutations. (see Chapter \n  21). A lymphoid-specific enzyme, called terminal \n  deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), adds bases to \n  broken DNA ends and will be discussed later in the \n  chapter in the context of junctional diversity.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>4. Joining<\/strong>: The broken coding ends as well as the signal ends are brought together and ligated by a double-stranded break repair process found in all cells \n  that is called nonhomologous end joining. A number \n  of ubiquitous factors participate in nonhomologous \n  end joining. Ku70 and Ku80 are DNA end-binding \n  proteins that bind to the breaks and recruit the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase \n  (DNA-PK), a double-stranded DNA repair enzyme. \n  This enzyme is defective in mice carrying the severe \n  combined immunodeficiency (scid)mutation, and mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme have also \n  been discovered in human SCID patients (see Chapter \n  21). Like Rag-deficient mice, scidmice fail to produce \n  mature lymphocytes. DNA-PK also phosphorylates \n  and activates Artemis, which, as mentioned before, is \n  involved in end processing. Ligation of the processed \n  broken ends is mediated by DNA ligase IV and XRCC4, \n  the latter being a non-catalytic but essential subunit of \n  the ligase.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rb3mm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Figure 8-10, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 8e, p182.<\/p>\n","answer_id":35554,"question_id":35547,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1440531662}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35547/which-process-is-right-to-describe-vdj-recombination-rag-1-and-rss-recurring","last_activity_date":1445717900,"creation_date":1435335438,"answer_count":1,"title":"Which process is right to describe V(D)J recombination?

It is also a matter of efficiency and reduced energy consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider that on average there are about 100,000 unique protein types being produced in a human cell <a href=\"http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=104521&amp;ver=0&amp;trm=human%20proteins%20number\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a>, but the human genome is estimated to contain only 19,042 protein coding genes <a href=\"http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=105447&amp;ver=7&amp;trm=human%20gene%20number\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]<\/a>, then the cell needs some way to vary that limited instruction set.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also remember that differentiated cell types express certain genes but not others, and produce different proteins that other cells do. So that implies that there are more than 100,000 different types of human proteins, and far fewer than 19,042 genes being expressed in any one cell at the same time.<\/p>\n\n<p>So without splice variants, our genomes would either need to be far larger than the approximately 3 billion base pairs it is already or our repertoire of proteins would be significantly less. We would also have a lot of redundancy, as many common exons would have to be repeated over an over again. That would require a lot more energy for DNA synthesis, and nucleic acid synthesis, etc. The process would become inefficient rather quickly and would likely make complex multicellular animal life untenable.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a bit of an error in your question. Splice variants are identified by the mRNAs that are produced, and exons are defined by the sequence that is in the mature mRNA. Introns are, by definition spliced out of the pre-mRNA, meaning that splice variants are not \"produced by different combinations of introns and exons.\" Splice variants will only consist of different combinations of exons. The only time an intron would be found in a mature mRNA is if a splice site is mutated and it is no longer recognized by the spliceosome, so it leaves the intron in incorrectly. This will generally result in a non functional protein.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The collection of components required to carry out the intricate processes involved in generating and maintaining a living, breathing and, sometimes, thinking organism is staggeringly complex.

Does it have something to do with the 'leakiness' of ion channels?<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, why is it that the resting potential is maintained and does not become increasingly more negative? Should it not be that because 3 Na<sup>+<\/sup> ions are pumped out and 2 K<sup>+<\/sup> are pumped in continuously, and more K<sup>+<\/sup> ions are diffusing out than Na<sup>+<\/sup> is diffusing in, that the potential is becoming increasingly negative?

Do the same for Column Width, I like 20mm. Now reselect the page of cells because changing the cell size will push some off the page. Right click the cells and format them to center the text horizontally and vertically. Now you can type your label text into the cells. I suggest font size 8 or smaller so you can fit it all in the cell. To make cutting the labels easier, put borders on all sides of all cells.

It will facilitate our handling of your application if you identify your family name on all correspondence with this office. This is of particular importance for names that do not follow standard English word order. If your name has changed since any of your supporting materials were issued, please inform us on your application. <\/p>\n\n<p>Those who have filed an application to the Graduate School in a previous year should read carefully the information on \"Reapplication\".<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1)<\/strong> Deadline and Fee Information<\/p>\n\n<p>Application Deadline December 1, 2015, 5 p.m. EST<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Biological Sciences in Dental Medicine*      <\/li>\n<li>Biological Sciences in Public\nHealth* <\/li>\n<li>Biophysics* <\/li>\n<li>Business Economics<\/li>\n<li>Chemical Biology* <\/li>\n<li>Chemical Physics* <\/li>\n<li>Chemistry and Chemical Biology*<\/li>\n<li>Division of Medical\nSciences* <\/li>\n<li>Economics <\/li>\n<li>Education <\/li>\n<li>Molecular and Cellular Biology*<\/li>\n<li>Organismic and Evolutionary Biology*<\/li>\n<li>Organizational Behavior<\/li>\n<li>Population Health Sciences <\/li>\n<li>Public Policy <\/li>\n<li>South Asian Studies<\/li>\n<li>Statistics<\/li>\n<li>Systems Biology*<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Participating programs in Harvard Integrated Life Sciences<\/p>\n\n<p>The application fee is $105. All applications received by the appropriate deadline with the correct application fee are guaranteed full consideration. Applications and supporting documentation received after the appropriate deadline will not be considered.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is required that you upload all supporting documents to your online application prior to submission. Consideration of your application will be delayed if supporting materials are sent separately. The Graduate School cannot guarantee review of supporting material received after the appropriate deadline.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only acceptable form of payment for the online application is credit card. The application fee is not refundable.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2)<\/strong> Selecting a Department and Subject<\/p>\n\n<p>The term \u201cprogram\u201d refers to the various departments, divisions, and committees that offer graduate degrees. See \"Degree Programs\" for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Locate the department, division, or committee to which you wish to apply, and enter the program subject name on the appropriate line on the application. Indicate the degree you seek on the degree line. Note that though most programs accept applications only for study leading to the PhD, a few offer the AM degree.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consideration by More than One Program \u2014 Occasionally, an application may be transferred by the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid to a second department that may be more suitable to the applicant\u2019s academic interest. Candidates for admission to member programs in the Harvard Integrated Life Sciences (HILS), may also apply to more than one program (see following section).<\/p>\n\n<p>For all other programs, it is Graduate School policy that an individual may submit only one application per program. Note: Engineering and Applied Sciences is a single program. Submission of more than one application to a single program will result in the withdrawal of the second application. Application fees are not refundable.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the exception of the HILS affiliated programs, the Graduate School does not recommend submission of more than one application. However, if you choose to submit multiple applications (up to a limit of two), the applications may not share any item. Each application must be unique, containing a separate Statement of Purpose for each program applied to as well as separate uploads to each application of transcripts, recommendations, and test scores. Online submission of the application is mandatory.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is Graduate School policy that an individual may submit no more than three applications during the course of his or her academic career. Submission of additional applications may result in the withdrawal of the application. Application fees are not refundable. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3)<\/strong> Applying to a Harvard Integrated Life Sciences (HILS) Program<\/p>\n\n<p>To apply to a Harvard Integrated Life Sciences (HILS) program, students must submit the GSAS online application by December 1, 2015. Admission is to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and registration is in one of the 12 life sciences PhD study areas within HILS.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, students apply to one HILS program, and we strongly recommend this targeted approach. While each program\u2019s admission committee makes its admissions decisions independently, the committees also consider each candidate\u2019s suitability in adjacent HILS programs as part of their evaluation process, and will transfer files accordingly. The GSAS Admission Office will notify you if this occurs.<\/p>\n\n<p>For candidates who nonetheless wish to formally apply to more than one program, HILS will accommodate the submission of up to three applications to its member programs under a single $105 application fee. Applicants who wish to submit multiple applications must indicate their program choices on the online application form using the specific code numbers listed in the \u201cPrograms, Subjects, Degrees, and Requirements\u201d section. Each application must be unique, containing a separate Statement of Purpose for each program applied to as well as separate uploads to each application of transcripts, recommendations, and test scores. Online submission of the application is mandatory.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you formally apply to more than one HILS member program using the online application, follow the instructions online to \u201cApply to more than one program.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that it is the policy of the Graduate School that an individual may submit no more than three applications during the course of his or her academic career. This policy applies to multiple HILS applications, including those to DMS departments, whether or not they are submitted under a single admission fee. If you apply to two HILS PhD programs this admission cycle, for instance, you will be able to apply to just one Harvard PhD program in the future. If you apply to three HILS PhD programs this admission cycle, you will be unable to apply to any other Harvard PhD program in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further HILS application details and instructions, see the HILS Admission/Application website.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4)<\/strong> English Proficiency<\/p>\n\n<p>Adequate command of spoken and written English is required for admission. Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold the equivalent of a US Bachelor's degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction must submit scores from the Internet based test (IBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), Box 899, Princeton, NJ 08541. When requesting official score reports, indicate the receiving institution as Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Code 3451. If an \u201cApplicant\u2019s Score Confirmation Report\u201d is available, scan and upload a copy, attaching it to your online application. However, the official institutional score report sent by ETS to GSAS is still required. A minimum score of 80 on the Internet based test (IBT) on the TOEFL is required for consideration by the Graduate School; some individual departments may require a higher score. Applicants who took the TOEFL more than two years ago must repeat the test. No test other than the TOEFL IBT will be acceptable as proof of English proficiency. Additionally, GSAS will use students\u2019 scores on the speaking section of the TOEFL IBT to determine the oral proficiency of admitted students. View the policy for additional information on this requirement. It is therefore highly recommended that applicants take the TOEFL IBT whenever possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5)<\/strong> Letters of Recommendation<\/p>\n\n<p>Submit three letters of recommendation from faculty or others qualified to evaluate your potential for graduate study. The letters must be received by the appropriate application deadline: December 1, 2015, Deceber 15, 2015, January 4, 2016. The Graduate School requires your recommenders use the online recommendation process. At least one letter should be from a faculty member at the last school you attended as a full-time student unless you have been out of school for more than five years. Substitutions for faculty recommendations may include work associates or others who can comment on your academic potential for graduate work. Indicate on the recommendation form whether you are waiving your right to see the letter of recommendation. Recommendation dossier services are not compatible with the online application process.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>6)<\/strong> Graduate Record Examination<\/p>\n\n<p>The Graduate School requires that applicants present scores of the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). Scores from either the computer-based or the traditional paper administration are acceptable. You must take the GRE in sufficient time for score reports to reach us by the application deadline. Many programs also require one of the GRE Subject Tests; requirements are noted in the list of \u201cPrograms, Subjects, Degrees, and Requirements.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Make arrangements to register for the tests well before administration dates. Scores should be reported to Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Code 3451. For further information write: Graduate Record Examination, ETS, Box 955, Princeton, NJ 08541. <\/p>\n\n<p>GRE scores are valid for five years only. Applicants who have not taken the GRE in the last five years and intend to submit scores should take the examinations again. If you have personal score reports available from tests taken within the last five years, scan, upload, and attach to your application. However, be sure also to have official institutional score reports sent directly from ETS; only official scores are acceptable.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>7)<\/strong> Transcripts<\/p>\n\n<p>The Graduate School requires that you upload a copy of your transcript from each college/university attended with your online application. An official transcript showing the conferral of the undergraduate degree is required to register in the Graduate School.<\/p>\n\n<p>Foreign transcripts\u2014records of all courses, seminars, and examinations, including grades, scores, grading scales, and conferrals of degrees\u2014must be in English. If records are not available in English, original records must be uploaded with certified English translations. All translations must be literal and complete versions of the original records. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Graduate School does not require applicants currently enrolled in a college or university to report their fall 2015 grades. Should you wish to report fall 2015 grades not reflected on the transcript you provided in your application you may do so using the Fall 2015 Grade Report section of the application.  After you have submitted your application you will be able to complete this section when your fall 2015 grades are available.  Use your User Name and Password to log into your application to access this form after you have submitted the application.  The Graduate School cannot guarantee that information submitted after the application deadline will be used in the evaluation of your application.<\/p>\n\n<p>Students who are unsure of the U.S. equivalency of their degree(s) should consult a reputable credential evaluation service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The University reserves the right to request additional academic documents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Abstract of Courses\nAlthough this form may duplicate information available on your transcript(s), it is essential that the admissions committee has available an orderly summary of your courses. The Division of Medical Sciences does not require that you complete this part of the application.<\/p>\n\n<p>Applicants to Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT) in the Division of Medical Sciences MUST complete the Abstract of Courses.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other Requirements\nAll applicants are strongly urged to upload a résumé or curriculum vitae with their completed application. Please see Program Details for additional requirements of your department.<\/p>\n\n<p>Papers and Manuscripts\nFollow instructions on the online application to upload a paper, manuscript, publication, or other materials in support of your application. Since the Graduate School cannot return these materials, applicants are urged to make and keep copies. All papers and manuscripts will be destroyed after admissions decisions are made.<\/p>\n\n<p>Questions?\nIf you have questions about your application, or if problems arise when completing it, you may call for assistance. We are unable to accept collect calls. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are two telephone numbers available for your use: one for questions that pertain to your application for admission and all supporting documents, and another for questions that pertain to your application for financial aid.

Not only so, these mutations induce calcium and cytokine dysregulation, and increase oxidative stress. <\/p>\n\n<p>Specific to molecular mechanisms of amyloid beta (abeta) oligomer toxicity, a good article <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2014/795375/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> makes some good descriptions. For example, abeta can reduce copper and iron ions. Oxygen reacting with these reduced metals become reactive oxygen species. They also noted that abeta reacts with many receptors, like TLR's which ended up promoting JNK-mediated apoptosis. I'd give that article a read, and I'll try to get some molecular pathology mechanisms for other facets of AD on board here.<\/p>\n\n<p>They can't <em>generally<\/em> be repaired because the issue is with genetic mutations, and some of the mutations engage in positive feedback loops with existing conditions that make a more pronounced effect. For example, tau protein is regulated in part by O-GlcNAcylation. This is like phosphorylation, but with sugar moieties, but it becomes downregulated when glucose is low, thus increasing phosphorylation on tau (Liu et al., 2004) . Mutations that affect GSK-3, insulin resistance and/or diabetes thus can play a role in AD pathogenesis.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some data exists to show restoration of potentially AD-causing abnormalities involving HDACs. For example, abnormal HDAC2 in AD brains hypoacetylated promoter regions for some housekeeping and plasticity genes, and they rescued the AD phenotype by knocking down HDAC2 (Gräff et al., 2012) . These are of course mouse models typically.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for question three, I really can't say except for stochasticity.

I can safely say that secondary neurons can fire multiple action potentials to a single, <em>short<\/em> <em>physical stimulus<\/em> delivered to the associated sensory neuron.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><br>\nPhysiologically, external stimuli are processed by sensory neurons. Sensory neurons generally work with graded potentials, not action potentials. Sensory neurons typically convey their graded response onto a secondary neuron that translates it into a frequency-modulated pulse train. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, I interpret your question as <strong><em>\"can a single, short stimulus delivered to a receptor generate multiple action potentials in the associated secondary neuron\"<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If sensory neurons were restricted to one action potential per stimulus, then a stimulus could only be detected in terms of its onset or offset. We can, however, sense prolonged stimuli. For example, we can perceive a continuous auditory tone and we can look at an image for extended periods without it fading away.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, it all depends on the sensory system. A great example is the tactile system, where some receptors mediate prolonged sensations, whereas others only mediate onset or offset responses. Their associated secondary neurons are therefore classified as rapidly adapting and slowly adapting fibers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Figure 1 shows the response profiles of various secondary neurons connected to different mechanoreceptors in the skin. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OardS.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OardS.gif\" alt=\"static stimulus\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

If it receives a static pressure difference, its associated neuron fires only a single action potential (or very few action potentials) at the start and end of the stimulus. Slowly adapting receptors causes their associated neurons to continue firing even after prolonged stimulation. Slowly adapting mechanoreceptors are Merkel's disks and Ruffini endings (fig. 2)   <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig7EX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig7EX.jpg\" alt=\"![skin Rs\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 2.

In the auditory field, the shortest acoustic stimulus possible is probably the click stimulus, which is akin to a pulse stimulus. An acoustic click is hence about the shortest possible stimulus known to activate a sensory neuron. An acoustic click can be as short as 30 microseconds. A short stimulus like that, however, still evokes multiple action potentials in auditory nerve fibers <a href=\"http://jn.physiology.org/content/76/1/17.long\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Parham et al., 1996)<\/a>. Admittedly, due to the mechanics of the inner ear, most notably the basilar membrane and the travelling wave the click evokes, the factual physiological stimulus may be longer, but in the auditory field at least, tens of microseconds is about as short as it gets. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hence, I would answer \"yes, instantaneous stimuli can evoke multiple action potentials in a given nerve fiber'.   <\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>References<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://michaeldmann.net/The%20Nervous%20System%20In%20Action.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mann.

Once a T cell or other cells are infected, HIV downregulates the CD4 receptor which it uses to gain entry. Because of this, there are less receptors so another HIV is less likely to infect that cell. Meanwhile, the infection itself upregulates CD4 receptors on other cells which means the downregulation is even more effective. There are other mechanisms but this is a major one.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Hiding means it is somewhere where we don't know where it is and it isn't that active. When HIV is active it is destructive but also the cell is aware it is there. The cell can then try to alert other cells that it is infected. If HIV isn't active but instead hiding, it can stay where it is without really being detected. Even the drugs we use usually only affect HIV whilst it is replicating. So again if it's in a cell that's long lasting and the HIV is not replicating then it is essentially hiding. Such a cell includes macrophages and memory cells when we are just talking about the immune system. <\/p>\n\n<p>Will HIV reside in the lymph node? Well yes, this is an exciting place for it. There's loads of exposed CD4 receptors and lot's of it's favourite T cells about. An infected cell will transmit HIV to other cells when they are signalling to each other. Even worse is when a dendritic cell is infected. Instead of instructing the immune system how to detect HIV infected cells, it is infecting them. <\/p>\n\n<p>HIV is an infection. As soon as the body detects it, it goes into overdrive trying to eradicate it. This means there are more cells for HIV to infect. More foreign material means the immune system is even further stimulated to make even more cells. However it doesn't want CD8 cells to proliferate too much nor too many HIV specific cells so driving too much proliferation is a bad idea. What HIV does do is make lots and lots of useless copies of itself. HIV particles that are so badly made they aren't functional. The body tries to fight these and makes more cells to combat these but there's no point because they aren't the problem. But this immune diversion and a larger target number of cells is exactly what HIV wants. Proliferation of HIV specific cells, particular CD8, is associated with delayed disease progression or control.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually the cancers caused by HIV are because of other viruses running unchecked.

So now not only is the pathway long, but the water also has to beat gravity. Increased force is necessary to pull the water up to the highest leaves. Additional difficulty comes from the trees growing upright. Fast - growing/short trees frequently have shorter life-spans. They achieve their expeditious growth by having broader, wider xylem vessels, this increasing their hydraulic efficiency. At the same time this provides space for embolisms. An embolism makes it unable for a xylem vessel to transport water. Taller, slow-growing trees are longer-lived, this is caused by them having multiple xylem vessels, rather than having only a few wider ones like the fast-growing trees. Short-growing trees also have a more secured hydraulic system, preventing the forming of air-locks.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39826,"question_id":39824,"up_vote_count":1}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39824/trees-ability-to-transport-water","last_activity_date":1445457889,"creation_date":1445455179,"answer_count":1,"title":"Trees ability to transport water","body":"<p>How can trees be able to transport hundreds of liters of water all the way up to the crown and out in the leaves?<\/p>\n","question_id":39824,"tags":["osmosis","trees"],"score":1,"accepted_answer_id":39826,"down_vote_count":0,"closed_reason":"duplicate","is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"up_vote_count":1},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42e1234315067529256f34b258d91466?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":18809,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/18809/cambelot","reputation":139,"display_name":"cambelot"},"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39825/effects-of-acids-and-bases-on-protozoa","last_activity_date":1445455801,"creation_date":1445455801,"answer_count":0,"title":"Effects of Acids and Bases on protozoa","body":"<p>Why is it that when you pour acid (HCl) on a culture of Euglena gracilis in an aqueous environment the protozoa begins to swell and when you pour a base (NaOH), it maintains its shape?<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel like Euglena might swell because the acid deforms its pellicle membrane as it becomes less hydrodynamic, slows down and it probably broke apart some microfilaments along its periphery as you can see that chloroplasts ooze out of cell.

Spiders move within and among suitable habitat for a number of reasons, including damage to existing webs, and life history changes that require new habitat types. They point out that spiders are probably choosing the proper habitat based on various cues from the habitat. How the spiders respond to the cues would have been shaped by natural selection. The specific cues used will vary among the different species of spiders but may include wind speed and direction, thermal regime (which affects dehydation foraging time), odor cues, density of competing spiders, and more. The many options are reviewed by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rc6Vz-cWickC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23\">Riechert and Gillepsie<\/a>, which is freely available and not too filled with technical jargon.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Many species of spiders do select their habitat based on prey availability. <a href=\"http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v15_n1/JoA_v15_p81.pdf\">Gillespie (1987)<\/a>  lists a number of references. She also studied the long-jawed orb weaving spider, which lives along streams and rivers.  She found that this spider tends to build nests in open areas near water, which prevented dehydration, but the exact site chosen was determined by prey availability. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2424265?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104627557887\">Enders (1973)<\/a> studied a different orb-weaving species. He found that the juveniles were most often in densely vegetation areas but that the adults were in more open areas at the edges of woods. He suggested that web site selection of adults is driven by light. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650050590\">Heiling (1999)<\/a> performed an interesting study on a nocturnal orb-web spider. The spider lives near the water so it will sometimes build its orb webs on the bridges crossing the water. She found that more spiders build their webs near the lights on one particular bridge compared to unlit parts of the bridge that were otherwise built the same. She found that there was more insect activity around the lighted area (no surprise there) and that the spiders that built near the lights caught more of those insects compared to the spiders that built away from the lights.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting result is when she studied the behavior of these spiders in the lab. Spiders that were born and raised in the lab preferentially went to the artificial light source. These had never before been exposed to the artificial lights. She argued that the light-seeking ability of the orb-web spiders she studied is genetic.<\/p>\n\n<p>These studies suggest that light may have functioned as a visual cue for web location long before humans lit up the night sky with house and street lights, at least for spiders that build webs in open areas. Spiders may identify open areas by light cues (lighter vs darker), perhaps along with other cues such as air movement and humidity. Lighter areas would presumably be more open and thus favorable to large numbers of flying insects. Natural selection would favor spiders that responded to light for web construction. Artificial lights may present a very strong visual cue that attracts spiders, as well as insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, other cues such as olfactory cues (mentioned by Riechert and Gillepsie 1986) may attract spiders. If insect prey are found in high abundance in open areas or near artificial lights, then you would expect higher concentrations of chemical odors emitted by the insects, thus drawing more spiders.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Clearly, more studies similar to that of Heiling (1999) but across a broader range of web-building spiders are necessary to determine whether many web-building spiders are responding to light and if the response is genetically determined. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Citations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Enders, F. 1973.

The oldest known spider fossil dates back to between 374-380 million years ago <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Coddington/publication/234150610_Systematics_and_Evolution_of_Spiders_%28Araneae%29/links/00463520a3ecd86c9d000000\">(Coddington and Levi 1991<\/a>.  Street lighting of any type only goes back <a href=\"http://www.isglighting.com/files/History%20of%20Street%20Lights%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Of%20America.pdf\">a few centuries<\/a>. So, spiders were spinning webs long <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIE2cHumanevop2.shtml\">before humans evolved<\/a>, and before we humans began lighting our streets and homes at night.<\/p>\n\n<p>The spiders are simply taking advantage of the situation. The lights draw insects, the food for the spiders. Webs constructed near light sources may catch more insects than webs constructed away from lights.  Could this affect the current or future evolution of spiders? Perhaps. The spiders that build webs near the lights may get more food, which allows them to obtain more energy, and potentially produce more offspring. This would increase their <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIE2Fitness.shtml\">fitness<\/a> relative to spiders that do not build webs near lights, which could lead to evolutionary change occurring over the next several thousands of years. However, it may be that so many insects flying around the web end up damaging the web much more often than the spiders away from the lights, so the spiders near the light expend much more energy maintaining the web and removing insects they don't eat.  This is one extremely hypothetical example (of many; see comments) to illustrate the point. We can't actually predict what evolutionary changes might occur, or even if they will occur. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the hypotheses stated in the comments below could be tested to determine whether natural selection is possibly occurring on spider species that build near lights, or if the observation is simply observation bias as noted by @Oreotrephes. <\/p>\n","answer_id":21299,"question_id":21295,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1410745194}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21295/did-spiders-respond-to-light-for-building-webs-before-artificial-light-was-inven","last_activity_date":1445371155,"creation_date":1410703575,"answer_count":1,"title":"Did spiders respond to light for building webs before artificial light was invented?","body":"<p>I have noticed that during summer, beautiful spider colonies grow wherever a strong light is:  <\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/h57Xo.jpg\" alt=\"spider colony on a bridge lamp\"><\/p>\n\n<p>I'm wonder whether spiders evolved to seek naturally lighted areas where they build nests (before artificial lights) or if they always had the ability to seek places full of juicy insects - and in cities this ability just leads them to lights.<\/p>\n","question_id":21295,"tags":["evolution"],"score":2,"accepted_answer_id":21299,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":460,"up_vote_count":2,"last_edit_date":1410744956},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e88cb69f4f2c12147fad67bc77e7ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1182,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1182/orcris","reputation":363,"display_name":"Orcris","accept_rate":100},"answers":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a43651dba3f306d9c0c0b92a7457722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":1441,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1441/bitwise","reputation":1705,"display_name":"Bitwise"},"score":15,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5e8817011bf40f20c518af3c0dc7187?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":137,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/137/kennypeanuts","reputation":1522,"display_name":"KennyPeanuts","accept_rate":75},"score":1,"post_id":5431,"edited":false,"creation_date":1354823350,"comment_id":7807,"body":"+1 beat me by 2 sentences."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1354823300,"creation_date":1354823300,"body":"<p>Mitochondria are very similar to bacteria and are thought to have originated from bacteria.

The main reason for this is that when you are running an agarose gel containing EtBr, due to the positive charge of the EtBr, the stain runs to the negative chamber, against the direction of the DNA migration as @Chris has pointed out! Although some of the DNA will stain but the rest of the EtBr will migrate towards the top of the gel (where the DNA is loaded).<\/p>\n\n<p>A quick remedy for this is once you ran your gel is to soak your gel in a separate container containing your stain and running buffer such as TAE. I do this for one hour and that makes a huge difference!! Also make sure you regularly change the buffer in your agarose gel running apparatus and don't use the same buffer for a long time since again as @Chris has correctly pointed out there is a reduced conductivity in the older buffers when they heat up so migration does not work as well! Obviously this response assumes that you have a good degree (amount) of DNA in your gel bands, which can be calculated by nanodrop once you extracted the DNA using an extraction kit, or whatever method you normally use. I hope this helps!<\/p>\n\n<p>This answer is more suited to the title of the question since after reading the main question a bit more carefully I'm slightly confused!

Bacteria multiplication is not limited by food availability only, it is one of many constraints. <\/p>\n\n<p>Oxygen availability, water availability and the absence of toxins also play a role. You can easily start a thriving bacterial colony somewhere, but once one of these conditions changes sufficiently, the colony can die off. And it can be the growth itself which changes the conditions. A classic example is found in wine fermenting. The yeast there multiplies freely until it has produced so much alcohol as a waste product that it dies off. This is why wine is always in the 12 to 18% ABV range, anything above is \"fortified wine\" where the concentration was increased after the yeast's death. Yeast are not bacteria, but bacterial colonies' growth is limited in similar ways. <\/p>\n\n<p>Second, even if the assumption were true, the spoon wouldn't be clean. Bacteria converting food in waste doesn't result in nothing, nor does it result in something gaseous which would literally disappear into thin air. OK, part of their byproducts are likely to be some gas. But you certainly get lots of bacterial bodies (alive, later dead) and also lots of waste product.

You probably did not keep track of the numbers and you probably did not make any statistical analysis. So there is really no reason to trust this observation. The idea that males are more often classified as handicapped than females is opinion-based for the moment and you will need a reference for this before asking why it is true.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>You also claim that most birth defects occur in males and not in females. You should also include a reference.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>You are talking about gender difference in \"handicap frequency\" and \"birth defect frequency\".

This strain grows on LB or 2xYT plates (and is resistant to tetracycline, see below), and competent cells can be made using standard techniques.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>We can go through these and look at the changes as well:<\/p>\n\n<p>F- means no F plasmid for conjugation. mcrA/B refers to mutations made which reduce the ability of the E. coli to attack foreign DNA. IN(rrnD-rrnE)1 is an inversion in the region of some rRNA operons that I'm unsure as to the effect. Lambda- removes the lambda lysogen. You can see that they have the lavUV5 promoter for an IPTG-inducible T7 polymerase which is important for getting the E. coli to begin producing T7 polymerase to express the associated cloning vector. You can also see that HT115 (DE3) is deficient for RNase III, however, which normally degrades dsRNA, making it suitable for the feeding experiment.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The L4440 (pPD129.36) cloning vector contains two convergent T7 polymerase promoters in opposite orientation separated by a multicloning site and was made using standard cloning techniques (Timmons and Fire, 1998).<\/p>\n  \n  <p>pLT61 contains 0.8 kb of unc-22 inserted into the L4440 vector.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think the L4440 plasmid is probably easy to optimize for this experiment, and cheap. If you can access the article I linked above, they catalogue some additional plasmids. In conclusion though, it'd seem that if we in fact had a system where the E. coli themselves could produce T3 polymerase, it'd be fine to use those promoters. In the case of this experiment, the genotype of the feeding strain of bacteria nicely complements the vector being used.<\/p>\n","answer_id":39708,"question_id":39706,"up_vote_count":3,"last_edit_date":1445279851}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/39706/plasmid-choosing","last_activity_date":1445279851,"creation_date":1445107813,"answer_count":1,"title":"Plasmid choosing","body":"<p>To design a experiment in feeding of C. elegans.

Leaving illegal compounds aside, I would vote for nootropics. And from them I find pramiracetam to be the best fit. I have found its action to be rather similar to the one described in the movie, although with no side effects. One of the most notable mechanisms of it is the highly selective potentiation of acetylcholine and improvement of brain blood flow. Papers on this chemical are easily accessible through Google, so I won't provide lnks.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, no cognitive enhancers will do any good without proper motivation and conscious efforts. It is pointless to eat pills and hope that something will come and change who you are for the good. Cognitive enhancers need something baseline to enhance.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Looks like this question really belongs to CogSci SE, but I feel that I should complement this answer with some more information that is important to take into account.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cognition/mind enhancement can be a double-edged sword for some people. Instead of giving pleasure directly, it actually enhances mind and calls for much more self-discipline and responsibility. For example, I practice meditation and some other mental disciplines for a long time already, and it came in handy to control and direct my mind. However, some people who tried pramiracetam reported that the intensity of their own mind was too much for them, they simply did not know what to do with it for they had no real task, motivation or big plan formed <em>before<\/em> administering the compound, and it could happen that they got themselves overwhelmed by many long-forgotten memories that rejuvinated in all their lucidity at the same time when the present day reality became much more integral and whole, without many pieces comfortably forgotten.<\/p>\n\n<p>These memories could not necessarily be negative, but what about a super-fine image of the wallpapers pattern you were looking at when you were 3 years old, standing as bright as a day before your eyes when you try to sleep, eat or mate? And I am not even saying about the fact that recent events are perceived in much greater detail and integrity, senses sharpened greatly... Personally I was able to control my mind because I also practice it in daily life (without the enhancers), but this may not be easy for people who are not used to that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another issue such an enhanced mind could face is that people around remain as they are. The perceived difference can render them much less intelligent and almost dumb. A person with an \"enhanced\" cognition can find himself living in a world of dense people. This is in no way an offense, a similar condition can be observed when one with a body \"enhanced\" by a stimulant can run 3 miles and still feel not even slightly tired, while an average untrained person will extinguish in under a mile. It is true that there are lots of smart people in this world, but one has to be ready for a sudden shift of perception that could occur. I remember reading reports of piracetam users who say that while they became more effective in integrating knowledge, people around did not, and situations occured when \"obvious\" things were not immediately understood by the surrounding people which caused irritation and conflicts. One has to be careful as this may lead to social disadaptation.<\/p>\n\n<p>This again calls for discipline, ability to love and appreciate other people, and actually rises many unusual ethical questions. As with any gain, one must always remember that love and understanding are essential.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another example of a two-fold effect is piracetam - an older, less potent but nevertheless useful nootropic. While it has an effect which may <em>with high probability<\/em> result in enhanced cognition, it also rises agression due to stimulating the secretion of the thyroid gland. So again, this calls for enhanced discipline. (do not mix the terms \"piracetam\" and \"pramiracetam\" in this text, they mean different compounds).<\/p>\n\n<p>In any way, it is always important to apply conscious approach to your own behavior and thinking, be it with or without enhancers. But with enhancers, the responsibility is times greater.<\/p>\n\n<p>One more point to notice. While nootropics do not exhaust body in any way (they are not stimulants), it is very important to provide oneself with sufficient nutrition and sleep, and avoid drug usage such as nicotine, alcohol and other psychoactive drugs. Failing on any of that may significantly reduce the useful effect and in case with illicit drugs cause unpredictable consequences.

There is even evidence that tigers share kills with related or unrelated individuals (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger#Social_activity\">Wikipedia: Tiger<\/a> for examples), and tiger home ranges can overlap in complex ways. On the other hand, lions (both males and females) are sometimes solitary, and this partially interacts with their living environment. <\/p>\n\n<p>My point is mainly that sociality (in general or in felines in particular) is not either/or for a particular species, and other felines also show social behaviours and sometimes form groups (so sociality should be viewed as a sliding scale).

This can be mitigated by an excessive amount of fat along with the carbohydrates, thus slowing down the spike.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your question: 1) Is it true that high blood glucose is normalized substantially more rapidly in people who have depleted their glycogen, or who have higher energy needs?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So this is a little confounded by several variables.  The thought process is that people that have less glycogen or higher energy needs, don't have insulin insensitivity; thus the same amount of insulin would do a better job of shuttling glucose into cells.  We know that consistent exercise increases insulin sensitivity, as does lack of persistent insulin signaling (such as comes from being in a glycogen depleted state).

If only size would matter that basically humans would be rather unintelligent beings ( many many animals have larger head and brain than us). Intelligence is more related to the complexity of the brain (number and size of different brain components) and the number of connections between neurons. We humans are intelligent because we have high complexity compared to our brain size, our brain has more grooves therefore higher surface than a whale brain. So even though whales are quite smart they're not as smart as us.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT: After getting a few comments I felt I need to clarify my answer, so here it comes: as pointed out by user137 humans have much higher brain-to-body size ration than whales and this is very important. What I was trying to explain (yet failed for the first time it seems), that mere physical size / volume is not that important. The level of development and complexity is that matters the most. Many parts of the human brain is found in lower order animals as shown in the image below: <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sPhTI.png\" alt=\"brain areas\"> (taken from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The surface to volume ratio matters because the higher ratio implies a more complex brain structure. So while whales have a higher surface in absolute value (approx 2-3 times) yet their brain is larger by approx 5-6 times ( lots of comparison data <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html\">here<\/a>), thus we have higher surface/volume ratio (i left the ratio part out on my original answer). In the accepted answer on the question linked by Bez it is said that more grey matter in frontal lobe correlates with IQ. Now since grey matter is made of neuron bodies and (fewer)axons, this is quite straightfoward --> more neurons = more connections = higher complexity. But all that comparison was made between humans. So brain size differences between different individuals of the same species may contribute to individual qualities. Comparing mere physical brain sizes of different species is not straightforward because of different brain development levels and brain structure.  <\/p>\n","answer_id":30543,"question_id":30542,"up_vote_count":6,"last_edit_date":1426724648},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1c6641d5c8556d9f351765c89b510f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19493,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19493/david-blomstrom","reputation":1247,"display_name":"David Blomstrom"},"score":2,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":0,"post_id":39751,"edited":false,"creation_date":1457422575,"comment_id":76545,"body":"Please could you add some supporting scientific material that reinforces your answer and allows further reading."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1445227661,"creation_date":1445227661,"body":"<p>There's really no answer to your question, unless you can define \"smart.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The brains of humans and cetaceans are very different, as are their environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our hands give us the ability to manipulate objects, a trait believed to have made enormous contributions to human intelligence.

Your question is at the border of the species definition. Therefore the question is not so much about Biology than about Philosophy, so let me advertise: The following answer is nothing else than a semantic discussion (philosophy) and has no relevance of our understanding of evolutionary processes. Note however that semantic discussions might be very helpful to evolutionary biologists as well.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sexual organisms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Dogs and wolves<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Commonly, in sexual organisms, species are defined by the concept of reproductive isolation. To address @WYSIWYG's comment, wolves can breed with dog. The offspring is called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfdog\" rel=\"nofollow\">wolfdog<\/a> and it suffers from little inbreeding depression.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Is the MRCA contained in the species of one descendent<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>But I'll use the wolf example anyway and make some fake assumptions. There are probably better examples I could pick though. Let's assume that wolves and dogs can't interbreed, that they are therefore separate species. Let's assume as well that somehow we manage to recreate the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of wolves and dogs (which has some issue due to parental effect incl. culture and epigenetic) and this MRCA can breed with wolves and but not with dogs, then we could eventually say that the MRCA and the current wolf (there are actually 3 species of wolves that are probably not real species) are the same species. One could then say that dogs descend from the wolf.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Feeling that we talk about improvement over another species<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>I think that much of the issue in saying that the dog descend from the wolf is that some people would understand things like \"dog is more evolved than the wolf\", which makes no sense. Both the current wolf and the current dog has evolved for exactly the same amount of time. Any living species on earth has evolved for exactly the same amount of time (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost 4 billion years<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Temporal constraint in the definition of species<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is eventually possible to say that one node on a phylogenetic tree is of the same species that the previous and the next node. I think that in reaction to the misleading feeling that early evolutionary biologists and current non-biologists people have in hearing that one species descent from another one, we tend to make a temporal constraint to the species. A species is what it is only at the exact moment we talk about it. This prevents us to consider a MRCA as being of the same species of any descendent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the definition of species yield to various issues such as the case of <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11240/transitivity-of-species-definitions/11243#11243\">ring species<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Asexual organisms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Same issue as above<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if we talk about asexual species. There is no clear definition of what is a species there. Of course if we were to use the definition based on reproductive isolation, then any asexual individual would be a new species. We therefore define a species when we see a group of phylogenetically related individuals that all share some feature that we find \"interesting enough\" (very arbitrary) to describe this group as a different species from the some other group of individuals. In asexuals, you may see one lineage that accumulate 10 mutations, while the other lineage accumulates 1000 mutations (this other lineage may eventually live in a different environment than the MRCA of the two lineages). Therefore, you get to the same issue when thinking about asexuals than about sexual organisms. If one lineage ressemble more their MRCA than the other lineage, then is their MRCA part of the species of one lineage?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is a species a thing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Well... the concept of species is useful in the sense that it is often not ambiguous to classify one individual into one species or into another. The concept of species allows us to better communicate.. so yes I guess it is useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of species existed way before we had any understanding of natural selection, mutations, genetic drift and other basic concepts in evolutionary biology. Aristotle used the concept of species (he also thought without having any good evidence that life evolves). This concept of species has been very well conserved because of the static view we had on what a species is before Darwin. Now that we have a better understanding of evolutionary biology, ecology and reproductive biology we discover that the concept of species is not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">natural category<\/a> but is a man-made unclear category.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Other discussion on the subject<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11240/transitivity-of-species-definitions/11243#11243\">In this post<\/a> I made an overview of the issue related to the concept of species.

The dense network is typically considered to reflect the association of transcriptionally inactive genes with the nuclear lamina. Specifically, this heterochromatin is thought to reflect a repressed gene state and suggests that the nuclear membrane and lamina may play an active role in gene repression.5 Lamin A/C and its binding partners can interact with DNA, histones, transcription factors and chromatin.6 Lamin-associated domains (LADs) are cis-acting sequences thought to range in size from ∼0.1\u201310 Mb, and these domains are thought to regulate the interaction of chromatin with the nuclear lamina; generally LADs are considered to be transcriptionally repressive.7 The precise sequences that define LADs have been elusive but nonetheless the LAD concept implies that the lamina and the genome interact in a specific manner. Therefore, it follows that one mechanism by which LMNA mutations may confer pathology is by altering the interaction between the lamina and chromatin. Consistent with this, LMNA mutant cells have altered chromosome territories.4 Meaburn and colleagues first examined chromosome localization in proliferating LMNA mutant fibroblasts and found that it resembled the chromosome organization associated with quiescent or senescent fibroblasts. They suggested that mutations in LMNA produced structural disruption to the lamina inducing a chromatin organization that may resemble an inappropriate cell cycle state. The presence of LADs and the fact that mutations in LMNA associate with altered nuclear architecture suggest that the nuclear lamina plays a vital role in both scaffolding chromatin and regulating chromatin organization. In this model, it is possible that distinct LMNA mutations may alter distinct regions of the genome leading to mutation specific profiles of altered gene expression.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":39735,"question_id":27809,"up_vote_count":1,"last_edit_date":1445198580}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27809/what-is-the-mechanism-by-which-lamins-regulate-gene-expression","last_activity_date":1445198580,"creation_date":1421576982,"answer_count":1,"title":"What is the mechanism by which lamins regulate gene expression?","body":"<p>The heterochromatin is generally localized at the nuclear periphery (also near nuclear lamina), whereas active genes are preferentially found in the nuclear interior. <\/p>\n\n<p>Children with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome have a mutation in a LMNA gene, which codes lamin A and C, therefore, mutation in a LMNA gene causes overexpression of genes near nuclear lamina, this shows that nuclear lamina has something to do with gene expression regulation. <\/p>\n\n<p>What is the mechanism by which lamins regulate gene expression?<\/p>\n","question_id":27809,"tags":["cell-biology","gene-regulation","chromatin"],"score":7,"down_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":156,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1427923952},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53b24cdd7441b8cd822b029088d09913?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":19469,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/19469/adrian","reputation":118,"display_name":"Adrian"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a51980d404d08ba2b8c640ce12120c88?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":17617,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17617/bshane","reputation":1739,"display_name":"bshane"},"score":1,"post_id":39726,"edited":false,"creation_date":1445169568,"comment_id":66579,"body":"Just to clarify: in the second part of your question, I think you&#39;re asking about neanderthals with living <i>descendants<\/i>, rather than ancestors.

If not, would it be possible, if we sequenced the genomes of a large number of Neanderthal fossils, to get a sense of how much variation there was in their gene pool, and use that to estimate the size of their population?

Bee males are produced without fertilisation, meaning that they only have one copy of each bee gene. When the male produces sperm, it only has this one set, so all sperms end up carrying the same set of alleles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Females on the other hand have the normal double set, with two different versions of each gene. So if you look at one gene, half of the female's egg should have one version and the other half should have the other version. All females of one hive are produced by the same queen and the one male that she mated with. Remember, the male only has one set, so the versions coming from the male are the same in all female offspring.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means a female's genes are made up of: 50% from the father (these are the same across all females) and 50% from the mother (where half the females have one version and half have the other version).
