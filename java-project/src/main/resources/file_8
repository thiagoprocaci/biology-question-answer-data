Your example covers two: the AB0-system and the rhesus-system.<\/p>\n\n<p>The AB0-system covers four groups: A, B, AB, and 0. In other words: people either have factor A, factor B, both factors or none. People with factor A either hand this factor down to their child, or they don't. Accordingly, people with factor B either hand it down or not. People with AB in any case hand down one factor, either A or B. People without a factor (group 0) can't hand down A or B. Given those rules, a child with griup 0 did not inherit factor A nor B. So the parents of this child don't have group AB, but can have any of the other three groups.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rhesus-system is about having (being positive, +) or lacking (being negative, -) an other factor, the so called Rhesus factor. A rhesus- positive person either does or doesn't hand down this factor to his/her children. A rhesus-negative person has nothing to hand down. Thus, knowing that the child in your example is rhesus-positive, it  did inherit this factor from at least one of its parents. This,  one can assume that one or both parents also carry this factor.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Final remarks:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There can be rare exceptions from the above mentioned rules.<\/li>\n<li>There are more details about this topic worth reading.

You need to decide on what exactly causes skin pigmentation: the enzyme or cell proliferation, and what is under the control of gene expression and what isn't.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of what you find on ultraviolet light and melanin will be somehow related to melanomas, the formation of which does involve gene expression, so it's important to keep the two separated.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultraviolet light does cause proliferation of melanocytes, which cause the skin to darken. Melanocytes impart melanin to keratinocytes; these cells then are what give you a tan. The keratinocytes undergo constant turnover, so are eventually shed, and in the absence of continued exposure to UV radiation, there is no need to keep producing melanin-heavy keratinocytes. \n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6jJW.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6jJW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The keratins and proteins within the stratum corneum act mainly by scattering and absorbing the UV. UV-R sets in action an integrated mechanism for the formation and delivery of melanin within melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This mechanism is probably triggered by keratinocytes, <strong>which respond to UV-R with bursts of mitoses and with increased production of ET-1 and POMC, thus creating a new demand for melanosomes.<\/strong> The mitotic rate of basal keratinocytes increases a day after UV exposure, reaches a maximum 2 days later, and maintains this level for ∼1 wk.

This causes (amongst others) the production of Kitl (Kit ligand, binds to the Kit receptor) and POMC (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proopiomelanocortin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proopiomelanocortin<\/a>) which is later processed to ACTH (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adrenocorticotropic hormone<\/a>) and the different MSH-forms (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melanocyte-stimulating hormone<\/a>). These act on the MC1R (Melanocortin 1 receptor) on the surface of the melanocytes and induce pigmentation. See the figure below from reference 1 as illustration:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/B8LCS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/B8LCS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In the melanocytes the binding of these ligands activates different signal transduction pathways which all finally lead to the activation of the transcription factor MITF (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphthalmia-associated_transcription_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microphtalmia-associated transcription factor<\/a>) which then upregulates the transcription of tyrosinase. \nSee the figure from reference 1 as an illustration about what goes on in the cell:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ceQE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ceQE.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>So the activity of the sun directly influences the signal transduction and later on the gene expression of Tyrosinase by a specific transcription factor. This translates a external stimulus (as UV light) down to the gene expression level. The stimulus does not affect the activity of the enzyme, only the amount available.<\/p>\n\n<p>This upregulation stops when there is no further signalling down from the keratinocytes and eventually the Tyrosinase will be degraded due to normal turnover of the enzyme. Since no or only little is made without the right stimulus, this causes a stop or reduction in the pigment production. This happens when you get less UV light on your skin which happens for example in the winter time in Europe. Shedding of the upper layers of the epidermis then leads to the loss of the pigmented keratinocytes which makes persons lighter.<\/p>\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414302\" rel=\"nofollow\">The melanoma revolution: From UV carcinogenesis to a new era in\ntherapeutics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111671\" rel=\"nofollow\">The roles of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and\npigmentation in melanoma.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","answer_id":44711,"question_id":44704,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44704/is-the-increased-decreased-enzyme-activity-tyrosinase-caused-by-an-environment","last_activity_date":1459280043,"creation_date":1459271740,"answer_count":2,"title":"Is the increased/decreased enzyme activity (tyrosinase) caused by an environmental factor (UV radiation) considered to be gene expression?","body":"<p>My AP Bio assignment asks that I research the effects of UV radiation on melanin production, but the directions and questions suggest that UV radiation influences gene expression.

They used a dissolved oxygen (DO2) sensor to measure the amount of dissolved oxygen in each bottle. One bottle was put under a light. The second bottle was wrapped with aluminum foil to block all light and was put under the same light. AFter 24 hours, pond water DO2 in the two bottles was again measured. Average values for DO2 from all students are provided in the following table.\n  <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YC6gW.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YC6gW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Calculate the gross primary productivity for the observed sample. Express your answer in mg fixed carbon/L/day to the nearest hundredth.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, so I know that net primary production (NPP) is the difference between gross primary production (from photosynthesis) minus Autotrophic respiration (Ra):<\/p>\n\n<p>NPP = GPP - Ra<\/p>\n\n<p>I also understand that the light bottle is measuring NPP, because it allows for both photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The dark bottle measures Ra because it only allows for respiration. Therefore, GPP can be calculated by rearranging the formula:<\/p>\n\n<p>GPP = NPP + Ra<\/p>\n\n<p>Calculating the difference in the final and initial values for both bottles, I get the following:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Light: 0.15 mg O2 / L   &lt;-- NPP<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Dark: -0.08 mg O2 / L   &lt;-- Ra<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Next, I plugged these into the formula:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>GPP = 0.15 - 0.08 = 0.07 mg O2 / L<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Using the conversion formulas provided on the College Board's AP Bio Appendix (essentially just multiplying the mg O2 / L value by 0.374128 to get mg Carbon fixed / L), I get the following:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>0.07 mg O2 / L * 0.374128 = 0.02618896 mg C fixed / L<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But according to my review book's solution, I was supposed to add 0.08, not subtract it.

However, it is not a good energy storage molecule. Following are the reasons why production of an energy molecule such as glucose is essential:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not all parts of the plant are photosynthetic. These non-photosynthetic plants need an alternate source of energy. Since ATP is unstable, it cannot be transported to different parts of the plant without degradation.<\/li>\n<li>Since photosynthesis cannot happen in the dark, the plants would require some energy molecule that can be utilized later on, in the dark conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Chloroplasts themselves require ATP in the dark conditions. They express an ATP-ADP translocase that actually imports ATP from the cytosol while pumping out ADP+P<sub>i<\/sub> <br>(See <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21622019\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a> review). <\/li>\n<li>Plants also need energy storage for seeds. This storage is usually in the form of starch (a polymer of glucose).<\/li>\n<li>Glucose is required for synthesis of cellulose which makes the cell wall of plants.<\/li>\n<li>The glycolytic pathway (including pentose phosphate pathway) produces important metabolites such as ribose (in the form of PRPP, which is important for nucleotide synthesis), pyruvate (which is used to synthesize alanine) etc.<\/li>\n<li>Glucose and some glycolytic metabolites (such as glycerol) also serve as osmolytes i.e. they maintain osmotic pressure in the cell. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Basically, points 4-7 convey that Calvin-Benson cycle not only produces sugar but what it actually does is fix inorganic carbon (as CO<sub>2<\/sub>) to organic form (in the form of sugar). So, most (practically all) of the carbon that a photosynthetic plant has, comes from this carbon fixation process and that's how plants are photoautotrophic.<\/p>\n","answer_id":42916,"question_id":42888,"up_vote_count":7,"last_edit_date":1459276093}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42888/why-is-atp-produced-in-photosynthesis-used-to-synthesize-glucose","last_activity_date":1459276093,"creation_date":1454293356,"answer_count":1,"title":"Why is ATP produced in photosynthesis used to synthesize glucose?","body":"<p>In photosynthesis ATP is produced in light-dependent reactions only to go to the Calvin cycle to be turned into glucose to make ATP during respiration:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8sJx.jpg\" alt=\"atp and glucose as used in photosynthesis\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Why isn't this ATP just directly released into the cell?

Often seen in farmland, marshes, etc. which it uses as hunting grounds for small rodents, rabbits, birds, frogs, lizards etc. and seen perching on poles, posts, and other man made structures, just like in your picture. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Identifying features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The wingspan is between 1.1 and 1.4 metres, making it medium-large relative to many European birds of prey. It has a short neck and medium length of tail which is fan shaped when the bird is in flight, and the tail is about as long as the wings are wide (distance between front and back edge of wings). In these pictures you can see an adult first, and a juvenile. The <strong>juvenile has a much lighter colour, and has distinctive black markings on the leading edges of the wings, shaped like commas or speech-marks<\/strong>. Common Buzzards also have dark tips to the tails and wings, becoming much more prominent in the adult, and yellow legs and beak.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eMdfc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eMdfc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dc9yS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dc9yS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/buzzard/index.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Images from RSPB.<\/a> See also, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collins-Bird-Guide-Lars-Svensson/dp/0007267266\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collins Bird Guide, ISBN: 978-0007267262.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>See the image in Chris' answer for a picture of <a href=\"http://www.birdsofeurope.co.uk/JUVBUZZ.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">juvenile in a similar pose<\/a> to the one you saw.

Insulation (which, in neurons, is basically layers of fat wrapped around axons so ions cannot pass) allows the electrical signal to move further along axons (less ionic leakage) and faster (due to decreased membrane capacitance-it takes less charge movement to generate the same potential difference across the membrane; see this question: <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13986/how-is-membrane-capacitance-related-to-the-increased-speed-of-saltatory-conducti\">How is membrane capacitance related to the increased speed of saltatory conduction?<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, you should check out wikipedia's page on cable theory of neurons:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_theory<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This is why myelination increases conduction speed, as you may or may not already know. The increased length of the ionic signal (due to the inhibited leakage) allows voltage-gated ion channels which are further away to be activated as a result of any given local membrane depolarization. This all happens faster due to the lower capacitance. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, the only way the action potential can actually \"travel\" at all is due to the sequential activation of voltage-gated ion channels along the axon. This is the case in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons, it's just that the spacing is greater when myelinated. In the insulated, fat-wrapped regions of axonal membrane, there are no ion channels, voltage-gated or otherwise. If there were, the layers of fat would not allow ions to pass through anyway at this point. Thus, the \"perfectly insulated\" axon could never actually propagate a signal, because the signal still requires the chain reaction of voltage-gated ion channel activation and sodium influx <em>at some point<\/em>. Myelinated conduction is faster because the spacing is increased, but increasing the spacing to infinity would not allow the action potential to be passed on.<\/p>\n\n<p>I suspect that there is a certain threshold in the extent of myelination where the spacing between nodes of Ranvier becomes to great to have effective propagation of action potentials. I wouldn't be surprised if evolution has resulted i a relatively optimal spacing of nodes. I suppose a better question might be: what is the speed of conduction between nodes?<\/p>\n\n<p>I suppose it would be possible to send current through a perfectly insulated axon and potentially activate a voltage gated calcium channel at the terminal. However, This would be different than an action potential and would be effectively reducing the neuron to an electrical wire.

We say that a rock perched on a cliff has potential energy, because if it falls it can do work. (Say by crushing a car that's parked underneath it.) When you look at a balanced rock, you can't see any of that potential energy - the rock on a cliff looks like the one in the valley. The one on the cliff only has energy within it because it \"wants\" to fall, and by doing so will cause other things to change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise with ATP. There really isn't anything about the ATP molecule where you can \"see\" the energy. The reason the ATP molecule has energy is because it \"wants\" to break up into ADP and phosphate. Like the rock on the cliff, ATP is in a meta-stable state. It's okay for right now, but give it a nudge and it will crush your car ... er, power your organelles. -- That's what enzymes using ATP do. They attach a bunch of ropes and pulleys to the ATP boulder, then push it off the cliff. ATP drops down, becoming ADP and phosphate, but as it does so the enzyme uses the ropes and pulleys to lift something else up.<\/p>\n\n<p>And what that energy does ... well, it does practically everything. In order for the cell to function, it needs to take low energy raw material and transform it into higher energy material. It needs to take amino acids and stick them together into (higher energy) proteins. It needs to synthesize (high energy) lipids for the cell membrane. It needs to use energy to transport cargo from over here to over there. It needs to transport various substances across the membrane. (These later two are using energy to overcome entropy.) All of these events need energy, and various enzymes use ATP to do it, by arranging things such that when ATP drops to ADP and phosphate the other end of the \"rope\" (the amino acids, the lipids, the transported goods) are raised up in energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as how ATP gets where it's needed, that depends. In the cytoplasm, there's a pool of available ATP, and it's free to diffuse. So an enzyme in the cytoplasm just grabs an ATP that's lying nearby, and over time a new ATP will float past it. However, there are various barriers in the cell, like the membrane of the mitochondria. In order to get past those, the ATP needs to be transported. Passive transport (basically a gate that lets ATP flow through) is a possibility, but for things like the mitochondrial membrane that's too slow, so the cell has active transport. These are little enzyme pumps that sit in the membrane and pull ATP from inside the mitochondria to the outside. (In the mitochondria this is fueled by the same hydrogen ion gradient that helps fuel ATP synthesis.)<\/p>\n","answer_id":44681,"question_id":44675,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44675/how-exactly-do-we-get-energy-from-food","last_activity_date":1459196140,"creation_date":1459187384,"answer_count":1,"title":"How exactly do we get \"energy\" from food?","body":"<p>I am captivated by human biology and I'm currently trying to understand the body and its processes in a greater depth.

Two major examples which come to mind are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huntingtin<\/a> gene and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMR1\" rel=\"nofollow\">FMR1<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Huntingtin is the causative gene of Huntington's disease. In people with Huntington's, a sequence of three nucleotides is repeated. The number of repeats varies, from a low of 9 in unaffected individuals, to more than 60 in severely affected ones. So depending on how many repeats you have, each of your Huntingtin alleles may have a different nucleotide size.<\/p>\n\n<p>FMR1 is the causitive agent of Fragile X syndrome. Like Huntingtons, the gene varies in the number of trinucleotide repeats, but for FMR1, affected individuals can have over 1000 repeasts, meaning an extra 3 kilobases of genetic material versus the alleles of an unaffected individual.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other genetic disorders are also related to the difference in allele size. You can have a deletion of a region of DNA (or an insertion) which is normally silent (recessive). The normal-length allele compensates for the defective allele, but the differently-sized disease allele is still present in the population, and counts as an allele of the gene.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's not just disease-prone alleles which exhibit length polymorphism. A number of other genes will show variation on both the DNA and on the protein level. If the insertion/deletion is a multiple of three nucleotides and occurs in a loop region of the protein or on an intrinsically disordered domain, the insertion has a reasonable chance of minimal structural effect on the expressed protein.

(In addition, a single strong scent might temporarily overload a predator's sense of smell making tracking more subtle scents more difficult.)<\/li>\n<li>Flushing an excretion point (single point reduces opportunities for invasion) under some pressure could help avoid blockage and parasitic invasion/accumulation.  (Providing a tube from the extraction organ to the excretion point allows more flexible (and protected) placement of the organ, but also increasing the benefit of a flushing mechanism.)<\/li>\n<li>Flushing could also reduce contact with skin. Urine might act as an irritant and a nutrient source for parasites.<\/li>\n<li>Adding a buffer is a common technique for any pipelined operation to allow smaller resources to handle temporal variation in input and output rate.  Without a such a buffer, all stages have to be sized for the maximum utilization rather than something closer to average utilization.<\/li>\n<li>Avoiding potential contamination of food and water may also be a benefit of controlled urination (or excreting might have a fertilizing or pest-deterrent aspect for plants).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Since terrestrial animals presumably <em>retained<\/em> urinary bladders developed by their marine ancestors, benefits associated with terrestrial lifestyle would only provide selective pressure to retain such a feature. However, if <em>somehow<\/em> a line of terrestrial animals abandoned urinary bladders, it is not entirely implausible that even scent marking benefits could increase the selective pressure enough to overcome some peculiar opposing selective pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Initially, the animal might apply scents by scratching at an area of skin irritated by urine release against some surface. Then this scratching might be preferentially located (i.e., a scent marking behavior is developed). Having such a behavior would then obvious bring benefits to storing a significant amount of urine and eventually to being able to squirt the urine (allowing the scratching behavior to fall away).<\/p>\n\n<p>The above are just somewhat reasonable speculations about what selective pressures might encourage the development (and retention) of a urinary bladder.  Hopefully, someone with actual knowledge will provide a better answer documenting established theory and evidence for how urinary bladders actually developed.<\/p>\n","answer_id":7353,"question_id":7350,"up_vote_count":12,"last_edit_date":1376598497},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a5839c4ba65ea85023e375aa2184ebb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4226,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4226/craig-pemberton","reputation":41,"display_name":"Craig Pemberton"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user3795"},"score":0,"post_id":9757,"edited":false,"creation_date":1376465850,"comment_id":12834,"body":"do you have references for these?"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"score":1,"post_id":9757,"edited":false,"creation_date":1376479209,"comment_id":12842,"body":"perhaps this is better as a comment on the accepted answer? maybe ask @Paul-a-clayton to add them in if valid"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ead9263d3f0f0cc74f54d5d9fdbaa4cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":12995,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/12995/damian-yerrick","reputation":103,"display_name":"Damian Yerrick"},"score":0,"post_id":9757,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/210cc4a4b2f281aaffe0b26521fe1ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":1590,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1590/rg255","reputation":11513,"display_name":"rg255","accept_rate":66},"edited":false,"creation_date":1421298342,"comment_id":44563,"body":"@GriffinEvo Craig didn&#39;t have 50 rep."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41CJK.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":5762,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/5762/the-last-word","reputation":4553,"display_name":"The Last Word","accept_rate":100},"score":0,"post_id":9757,"edited":false,"creation_date":1421319728,"comment_id":44601,"body":"I&#39;ll let you keep the rep and not delete your answer but please put well structured, referenced answers from now on."}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1376451910,"creation_date":1376451910,"body":"<p>A few observations to add to Paul's:<\/p>\n\n<p>Urinating on yourself in winter could be a fatal thermoregulatory mistake.<\/p>\n\n<p>Urinating on your substrate could hinder locomotion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Having a continual slick of high osmolarity fluid on your skin would be damaging to the epithelium and work at odds to the action of the kidneys.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9757,"question_id":7350,"up_vote_count":4}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7350/why-did-the-urinary-bladder-evolve","last_activity_date":1459158259,"creation_date":1361793212,"answer_count":2,"title":"Why did the urinary bladder evolve?","body":"<p>Sure it's <em>convenient<\/em> to decide when to urinate but not <em>essential<\/em> for survival or reproduction, as I understand.

But most proteins are in scant concentrations, just as many as required for their job, and go up and down depending on their specific roles, rather than on general metabolic trends. Even if some general control mechanism increases protein synthesis across the board, in a cell proteins are 20% actin, 20% tubulin, 0.0001% 4E-BP and 0.0001% p70-S6K (made-up numbers for the sake of example), any 1% total protein increase you'd like to measure would be 200,000 easier to detect in tubulin than in p70-R6K.

According to the localization, separate areas of this system can be defined by its site (for example, the cardiometasympathetic area in the heart). The metasympathetic system attains the features of true autonomy.

It is explained in more details in this article <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1640/1231\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Evolutionary biologists studying plant\u2013herbivore interactions have convincingly argued that many plant secondary metabolites, including alkaloids such as nicotine, morphine and cocaine, are potent neurotoxins that evolved to deter consumption by herbivores.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>But it seems that those same chemicals produce adverse effects to what they were originally intended for:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, one or more plant alkaloids have been identified that interfere with nearly every step in neural signalling. Targets include neurotransmitter synthesis, storage, release, binding, deactivation and reuptake, ion channel activation and function, and key enzymes involved in signal transduction.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Paradoxically, the same properties invoked to explain why common drugs like caffeine, nicotine and cocaine are toxic are also those invoked to explain why these compounds are rewarding. It is therefore important to stress that these and other addictive drugs appear to have evolved only <strong>because they successfully deterred<\/strong>, not rewarded or reinforced, plant consumption. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, let's take a closer look at nicotine. This compound is not present at all times in the plant, instead it is produced as a reaction to a trigger.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Nicotiana attenuata<\/em> is an important model species for the analysis of plant\u2013herbivore interactions involving nicotine. It is a domesticated North American tobacco plant that is attacked by over 20 different herbivores, ranging from mammalian browsers to intracellular-feeding insects. These attacks elicit a battery of defensive responses, including nicotine production.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><em>Nicotiana<\/em> has therefore evolved to allocate chemical defences strategically by concentrating them in the most valuable parts of the plant, such as young leaves, stems and reproductive organs, and by modulating its production according to the type of herbivore and extent of leaf damage.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This last example concentrates on nicotine, but it makes it easier to grasp how plants might use the production of such a chemical as a mean of protection.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, depending on the substance and the creature which consumes the plant, one might witness different outcomes. I found interesting information in this less detailed text <a href=\"http://www.decodedscience.com/drugs-nature-chemistry-addictive-alkaloids/53057\">here<\/a>: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Defensive compounds from plants, like nicotine and cocaine, usually target nervous system components in insects. These components include proteins that have important roles on the insect\u2019s physiology, which may include specific receptors, ion channels, enzymes, etc. In most cases, the defensive chemical kills the insect by interfering with one or more of these proteins; in other cases, the chemicals just make the plant distasteful for the insect, and therefore, the bug will leave the plant alone.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","answer_id":36625,"question_id":36620,"up_vote_count":27,"last_edit_date":1438736077},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"score":11,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10de963b115fd0720d6a558fd1ac06c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":10456,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/10456/march-ho","reputation":5867,"display_name":"March Ho","accept_rate":80},"score":0,"post_id":36632,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438750310,"comment_id":61047,"body":"Arguably, caffeine acts as a stimulant at all doses, which is why it is toxic at high doses."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":11736,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11736/jamesqf","reputation":401,"display_name":"jamesqf"},"score":1,"post_id":36632,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438797637,"comment_id":61111,"body":"It&#39;s also arguable that everything is toxic at high doses - including oxygen and water."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50facfccdffe2e9cabaa589205959d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":6683,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6683/mason-wheeler","reputation":213,"display_name":"Mason Wheeler","accept_rate":20},"score":0,"post_id":36632,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438804131,"comment_id":61120,"body":"Caffeine has an overall positive effect?

Once you have a finished product, even if it's somewhat more simplistic than you'd like, it'll be much easier to work your way up from there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Really though, consider the choice of modeling framework to be part of your research project! Only you can come up with the right choice for your project, though as a practical matter you should heavily favor any framework that at least one person in your department already has some experience using. Things will go wrong, you will have questions, and Stack Overflow won't be able to answer all of them. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a list of the more interesting agent-based modeling frameworks that I found from a few minutes of googling:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_hpc.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Repast HPC<\/a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pros:\n\n<ul>\n<li>C++ based<\/li>\n<li>The only performance focused one of the bunch<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>cons:\n\n<ul>\n<li>C++ based<\/li>\n<li>For simple models, would be like building a supercomputer to use as a pocket calculator<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netlogo<\/a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pros:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on being accessible to non-programmers<\/li>\n<li>Scripting language seems pretty straightforward<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>cons:\n\n<ul>\n<li>In my experience frameworks that try to implement their own scripting language in an attempt to be accessible to non-programmers ultimately end up being much more complicated to use than frameworks based around an established language.

The reason we often associate retinoblastoma with childhood disease is because when they carry a germline mutation, every cell in the tissue carries this, therefore they do not need a high division rate to drive oncogenesis."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVoco.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":14587,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/14587/the-nightman","reputation":1330,"display_name":"The Nightman","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":30171,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjvUL.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"moderator","user_id":3340,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3340/wysiwyg","reputation":23153,"display_name":"WYSIWYG","accept_rate":80},"edited":false,"creation_date":1425740410,"comment_id":49696,"body":"With germline mutations it is no probably more a question of overall somatic fitness.

Outside the CNS, the endothelial cells lining the capillaries allow for relatively free diffusion of substances from and to the blood via transcellular diffusion. In other words, substances can diffuse relatively freely to and from the blood via the extracellular space between the endothelial cells. In contrast, endothelial cells in the capillaries in the CNS are coupled via <strong>tight junctions<\/strong>, which prevents most compounds from diffusing into the extracellular space in between the cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, for compounds to enter the brain, they have to diffuse into the endothelial cells and back out again into the brain. This means they have to diffuse from the aqueous milieu in the blood, through the lipid-rich cell membrane and back into an aqueous solution in the extracellular space in the brain (source: <a href=\"https://cias.rit.edu/faculty-staff/101/faculty/340\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Texas<\/a>).       <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/thFkK.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/thFkK.jpg\" alt=\"![![![BBB\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Blood-brain-barrier. source: <a href=\"https://cias.rit.edu/faculty-staff/101/faculty/340\" rel=\"nofollow\">RIT<\/a><\/sup> <\/p>\n\n<p>Most drugs cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) by transmembrane diffusion, which is mainly dependent on whether the drug is able to meld into the cell membrane. A <strong>low molecular weight<\/strong> and high degree of <strong>lipid solubility<\/strong> favor this mechanism. However, a drug taken up by the membranes in the BBB must eventually dissolve into the aqueous environment of the brain's interstitial fluid to take effect. As a result, a substance that is too lipid soluble collects in the lipid portion, but is not able to leave the BBB. I.e., it enters the BBB, but doesn't cross it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover, lipid solubility also favors uptake by the peripheral tissues; this, in turn, lowers the concentration of the drug in blood. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, while lipid solubility can increase transport rate across the BBB, it can also lower the amount of the drug presented to the BBB. <\/p>\n\n<p>Factors in addition to lipid solubility include <strong>charge<\/strong>, <strong>tertiary structure<\/strong> and degree of <strong>protein binding<\/strong>. Chief among these secondary factors, however, is <strong>molecular weight<\/strong>. The best approximation of the influence of size on <strong>BBB penetration is<\/strong> that it is <strong>inversely related to the square route of molecular weight<\/strong>. Few substances over 500 Da cross the BBB. In addition, lipid-soluble substances with molecular weights over 400 Da can be substrates for P-glycoprotein, a major brain-to-blood efflux pump located at the BBB, which prevents or greatly retards a large number of small, lipid soluble molecules from entering the CNS. However, Peptides and proteins with molecular weights in excess of 600 Da are known to cross the BBB in amounts sufficient to affect CNS function, such as the enkephalins. The largest substance found to date to cross the BBB by the mechanism of transmembrane diffusion is cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 at 7.8 kDa <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697631/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Banks, 2009)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that some parts of the brain do not feature a BBB, including but not limited to, the pituitary, area postrema and pineal gland. Many of these areas participate in hormonal control. These structures hence need to be in contact with the blood stream to sense the presence of hormones and other compounds (source: <a href=\"https://cias.rit.edu/faculty-staff/101/faculty/340\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Texas<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>Reference<\/strong><br>\n<strong>-<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697631/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banks, <em>BMC Neurol<\/em> (2009); <strong>9<\/strong>(Suppl 1): S3<\/a><\/sub><\/p>\n","answer_id":44598,"question_id":44324,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1458885487}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44324/what-determines-whether-a-substance-can-diffuse-across-the-blood-brain-barrier","last_activity_date":1458885487,"creation_date":1458090496,"answer_count":1,"title":"What determines whether a substance can diffuse across the blood-brain-barrier?","body":"<p>What determines whether a chemical substance is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier via passive, transmembrane diffusion?

Some of those species deposits upon their seed coat a wax layer. This layer makes seeds behave in a very hydrophobic way. You cannot dispense them in a pour water.<\/p>\n\n<p>That behavior has many impacts. One of the most significant is that it does not let water come in touch with the actual seed and then with embryo to make it sprout.<\/p>\n\n<p>So i tried many ways to remove that layer but nothing actually seemed to work out.<\/p>\n\n<p>I treated seeds with the following chemicals:<\/p>\n\n<p>a) 1% NaOCl with some dish soap water solution for 10min. After throwing seeds into this solution you could see that they can be evenly dispensed in it and come in touch with the solution. But if you wash them up with pure water for example 3 times they are getting back their hydrophobic behavior.<\/p>\n\n<p>b) 1% H<sub>2<\/sub>SO<sub>4<\/sub> water solution for 10min. I thought that with this treatment waxes will be removed from the seeds but nothing like that happened. Maybe they had been better dispensed in the pure water comparing to the previous treatment but nothing significantly changed.<\/p>\n\n<p>c) 93% ethanol solution for 1, 2, 3, ... 30min. results here were also very disappointed. While the seeds are immersed into ethanol, they were very well dispensed into the liquid without any hydrophobic behavior. After three washes with pure water, hydrophobic properties came back.<\/p>\n\n<p>Treatment time seems not to play any significant role on the results.<\/p>\n\n<p>My conclusion is that there is no destruction of the waxes with the above chemicals. The only thing that happened probably, is the creation of a Micelle around the seed, which make it for a while (the time that it was in the solutions with soap and ethanol) non hydrophobic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally my question is, if there is any way to destruct chemically, to some grade the waxes.

The reference eubacterial ribosomes from E.coli are 70S with a large subunit of 50S and a small one of 30S. The reference eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes (rat liver, say) are 80S, with large and small subunits of 60S and 40S respectively. The actually sizes (S-values) of the subunits in other eubacteria (say mycoplasma)  and different eukaryotes (say yeast) may differ, but the eubacterial ribosomes share an antibiotic sensitivity (e.g. to streptomycin, erythromycin) which differs from that of eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes (e.g. to cycloheximide) and so it is often convenient to refer to 70S-type ribosomes or 80S-type ribosomes, despite the size difference.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes share some of the antibiotic susceptibility of eubacterial ribosomes (e.g. sensitive to streptomycin, but not to erythromycin) and their rRNA is more closely related to the latter. So they have 70S-type ribosomes with 50S-type and 30S-type subunits. However they vary greatly in size. For example, pig mitochondrial ribosomes are smaller at 55S, with large and small subunits of 39S and 28S, respectively. In contrast, yeast mitochondrial ribosomes are larger at 74S, with large and small subunits of 54S and 37S, respectively. More important, they differ from eubacteria in their ratio of RNA to protein, unlike chloroplast ribosomes, which workers in the field have classified as bacteria-like. This is shown in the table:\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLWfK.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLWfK.png\" alt=\"Sizes of different classes of ribosomes\"><\/a> <em>[Adapted from Supplementary Table S1 in Science (2014) vol 343, 1485\u20131489]<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The striking thing about most mitochondrial ribosomes is, whether or not they have undergone a decrease in their rRNA, they have additional proteins with no analogues in bacterial ribosomes. Structural work on both mammalian and yeast mitochondrial large ribosomal subunits show that these additional proteins are associated with an altered exit tunnel for the growing polypeptides, which appears to be tailored to conduct the latter directly to the mitochondrial membrane.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Answers (depending on intent of question)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes have large and small subunits.<\/li>\n<li>No, their sizes are not 50S and 30S, but vary greatly.<\/li>\n<li>Yes, mitochondria and plastids have 70S-like ribosomes, rather than 80S-like ribosomes, but these have evolved considerably from their eubacterial precursors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sources<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Some of my assertions are based on recent papers and earlier work referenced in them.

The visual system works on a huge intensity scale. The only way to do that is by <strong>adapting to ambient lighting intensity<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The sensitivity of our eye can be measured by determining the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)\">absolute intensity threshold<\/a><\/strong>, i.e., the minimum <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance\">luminance<\/a> of a stimulus to produce a visual sensation. This can be measured by placing a subject in a dark room, and increasing the luminance of the test spot until the subject reports its presence. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dark adaptation<\/strong> refers to how the eye recovers its sensitivity in the dark following exposure to bright light. The sensitivity of the visual system increases approximately 35 times after dark adaptation.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Dark adaptation forms the basis of the <strong><a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/fi/academic/subjects/life-sciences/neuroscience/duplicity-theory-vision-newton-present\">Duplicity Theory<\/a><\/strong> which states that above a certain luminance level (about 0.03 cd/m2), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision, called photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing scotopic (night) vision. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism.<\/p>\n\n<p>The dark adaptation curve shown below (Fig. 1) depicts this duplex nature of our visual system. The sensitivity of the rod pathway improves considerably after <strong>5-10 minutes in the dark<\/strong>. Because after you switch off the light the rod system is still inactive, you are unable to perceive much. The reason why rods are inactive is because they are said to be photo bleached. <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_and_recycle\">Photo bleaching<\/a><\/strong> refers to the visual pigments in the rods and cones to become used up because of the high light intensities when the light was still on. The pigment needs to be regenerated and that takes time. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q7gIe.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q7gIe.jpg\" alt=\"adaptation\"><\/a><br>\n<sup>Fig. 1.

Once formed, the more stable will be able to cruise the membrane surface, unchanged. This tells you that certain complexes will, by their stability and membrane fluidity, be in constant motion, and thereby statistically well distributed on the cell surface, a very important feature for many infrastructures (look up \"lipids rafts\" as a topic for examples). \nNow, the notion of localization in biology may refer to absolute location (e.g. cell pole), or simply the relative positions of certain compounds. Such is the case for cell junctions, which need to co-localize with certain cytoplasmic compounds, belonging to the cytoskeleton. Relative localization therefore, in this case. Do understand though, that both these infrastructures and photoreceptors need to be well distributed on the cell surface, each for its own reasons (mechanical strength, and optimal photo-capture, respectively).\nThe example of synapses is different, as the exact site of synaptic attachement in between cells plays a role in neural messaging and its regulation. This is, therefore, a different topic, which may involve absolute positioning of infrastructures. However, at these sites, protein movement along membrane surface and ocmplex forming principles remain the same; this is an example of absolute localization.<\/p>\n","answer_id":44585,"question_id":44577,"up_vote_count":0}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/44577/are-intercellular-junctions-synapses-and-light-capturing-photosynthetic-complex","last_activity_date":1458820059,"creation_date":1458798104,"answer_count":2,"title":"Are intercellular junctions, synapses and light-capturing photosynthetic complexes mobile?","body":"<p>I was reading Cell Biology by Gerald Karp and came across a section which said-<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Membrane fluidity makes it possible for clusters of membrane proteins to assemble at particular sites within the membrane and for specialised structures, such as intercellular junctions, light-capturing photosynthetic complexes and synapses.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I would be obliged to know more about the topic.<\/p>\n","question_id":44577,"tags":["cell-biology","homework","plasma-membrane"],"score":-1,"down_vote_count":1,"closed_reason":"duplicate","is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"up_vote_count":0,"last_edit_date":1458820059},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef07743a8a849d44a56f4f0e80169e33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":22724,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22724/simon-nilsson-guldstrand","reputation":9,"display_name":"Simon Nilsson Guldstrand"},"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YczA.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":9943,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9943/christiaan","reputation":26721,"display_name":"Christiaan","accept_rate":93},"score":2,"post_id":44546,"edited":false,"creation_date":1458730181,"comment_id":77637,"body":"Questions should be specific and not lead to discussions.

It is a change in trait values of populations over time. It results from four mechanisms: mutation, migration, drift, and selection. The first three lead to random change from one generation to the next, which may increase or decrease fitness, while selection will generally lead to adaptation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we know evolution still occurs in modern humans?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Well human traits (characteristics like hair colour, height, eye colour ...) are often determined, to varying degrees, by genetic information. That information is passed from parent to offspring (inheritance) and that information can accumulate new variation (e.g. by mutation), while some variation can be lost from the population (by drift, migration, selection). These are the conditions required for evolution. <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therefore, from one generation to the next, population trait values can change.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How will humans evolve in the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Difficult to say, evolution is a quite random process and difficult to predict. However, the process of adaptation (the result of genetic variation and selection) is a little more predictable. Following from the above, if there is genetic variation in a trait then there is a good opportunity for it to evolve by selection (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1972.tb00764.x/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley%20Online%20Library%20will%20be%20unavailable%20on%20Saturday%2027th%20February%20from%2009%3A00-14%3A00%20GMT%20%2F%2004%3A00-09%3A00%20EST%20%2F%2017%3A00-22%3A00%20SGT%20for%20essential%20maintenance.%20%20Apologies%20for%20the%20inconvenience.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fisher's Fundamental Theorem<\/a>). For example, we now see more women choosing to have children later in life, this means selection will be stronger against genes which cause early-life mortality in women and selection will favour genes that slow reproductive ageing in women.  Conversely, modern medicine is reducing selection against genetic diseases as we are better able to combat them, so we will probably evolve to show genetic diseases more frequently - selection against genetic diseases is weaker, therefore disease causing mutations can persist more easily in the population, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation%E2%80%93selection_balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutation-selection balance<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are able to prove that a trait is subject to selection and that there is genetic variation then you should be able to say that, in the short term at least, evolution in that trait will proceed in a predictable manner.

A lot of things affect how quickly a population or species can adapt to a new environment, including population size, mutation rate, generation time, standing genetic diversity, and selective pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>The diversity of life encompasses practically all combinations of those variables. A bacterial population might very well contain enough diversity to allow a portion of the population to overcome a rapid change. In fact, applying antibiotics to a bacterial population and counting the survivors is a common measure of mutation rates.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, organisms with small populations and long generation times will be much less likely to overcome a rapid environmental change. This is why there is so much concern over anthropogenic changes to the environment, including climate change.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's hard to provide a definitive answer, since \"rapid change\" is a relative term, and the difficulty of adapting isn't known. Some striking adaptations can be caused by a single base pair mutation, such as in beetles and Monarch butterflies that are <a href=\"http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/218.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">insensitive<\/a> to toxic plant compounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's important to point out that natural selection is based on <em>relative<\/em> fitness. Therefore, an adaptive mutation will spread because it's likely that carriers will be more fit than all of their neighbors. This does not necessarily mean that individuals without the mutation will die or fail to reproduce, only that those with the mutation will do it better.<\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise, adaptation is not necessarily caused by the environment changing and wiping out all but a few lucky mutants like in the bacteria example. Instead, the environmental change might make things more difficult, but as long as the population can persist, then mutations will continue to enter the population which could confer a selective advantage against the change. So, no, a population does not (cannot) carry all possible adaptations. A population cannot adapt to an environment it hasn't encountered.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, it's worth pointing out that a species can expand its range through migration. A new, unsuitable environment can act as a migration sink (that is, migrants make it there but fail to establish) for a nearby population. If this happens for long enough, some of the migrants may have a mutation allowing them to establish in the new environment.<\/p>\n","answer_id":3077,"question_id":2944,"up_vote_count":4},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sIMq.jpg?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":4108,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4108/remi-b","reputation":22909,"display_name":"Remi.b","accept_rate":88},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1457809472,"creation_date":1457809472,"body":"<p>It is a good question.

There is one particular thing that has always bothered me for which I have not seen a good treatment, relating to adaptations to the environment with respect to genetic diversity.  If it is possible for a population to adapt to rapid environmental changes, and they don't have an adaptation for dealing with change directly (such as a complex brain), it seems to me that every generation must have present within them almost every possible environmental adaptation that the population is capable of expressing (including many irrelevant ones and a few relevant to the particular environmental challenge).  Otherwise, it may take too many generations to deal with a change, which may be disastrous for the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my question would be: how does an evolutionary biologist explain the mechanics behind the ability for a population to adapt quickly?  Are most environmental changes slow or gradual enough that the population has a few generations to happen upon the mutations that will allow it to survive, and have generally been successful in this regard for 3.5 billion years?  Or, are a large majority of possible adaptations present in almost every generation, and just serve no purpose or advantage for most of the population if the provided \"benefit\" is unneeded (i.e., are effectively neutral)?

You may remember talking about <a href=\"http://circuitsurfersdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/sickle-cell.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">sickle cell anemia in high school.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So is it wrong then to say that apes and humans share 99% of their DNA or is it equally correct to say \"genes\"?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Well the similarity between humans and chimps in terms of known DNA sequence is about 98.8%, there is fairly low sequence divergence, so in my opinion you are right to say that they share 99% of their DNA. This means that in 100 nucleotides there is roughly one difference e.g. (showing 90 bases, made using random sample of four letters in R):<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Human DNA strand:<\/strong> <\/p>\n  \n  <p>atgactgtagcccatga <strong>t<\/strong>\n  gtaaacgtaccaagcctcctcggctgtcccgaaatagatacgcctggtagacgtattaatagtgagtaa...cgt<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Chimpanzee:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n  \n  <p>atgactgtagcccatga <strong>c<\/strong> gtaaacgtaccaagcctcctcggctgtcccgaaatagatacgcctggtagacgtattaatagtgagtaa...cgt<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Having said that, given that there is <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/11006943\" rel=\"nofollow\">>3,000,000,000 base pairs in the human genome<\/a> (the sequence of 4 nucleotides that make up the DNA) that equates to ~36,000,000 different base pairs (bnetween humans and chimps) which likely equates to a large difference. Sometimes even a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced snip), a change in just one base pair, can bring about quantifiable changes:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a single base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is\n  associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer disease.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is a little <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps\" rel=\"nofollow\">reading on the humans vs chimp<\/a>.

Some work has suggested that the heterochromatin, previously labelled as Junk DNA, actually has some effect on traits. For example in <em>Drosophila<\/em> there has been studies which show <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18174442\" rel=\"nofollow\">effects of the Y chromosome<\/a> on traits despite the Y chromosome being mainly heterochromatic.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further: I think a common source of confusion comes from the use of the word gene. It is often used interchangeably to mean either <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele\" rel=\"nofollow\">Allele<\/a><\/strong> or <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_%28genetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genetic Locus<\/a><\/strong>. When someone says that humans and apes share 99% of their genes they mean they share 99% of their genetic loci. When someone says that a person shares 50% of their genes with a parent they mean that they share half of their alleles with that parent (it is only roughly half due to recombination and mutation). An individual has all (barring genetic defects <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18157829\" rel=\"nofollow\">such as deletions<\/a>) the same loci as their parent.<\/p>\n","answer_id":9173,"question_id":9172,"up_vote_count":5,"last_edit_date":1373369564},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":14,"is_accepted":true,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2d7180a729d97fe94725ae985f724d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":3970,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3970/fredsbend","reputation":390,"display_name":"fredsbend"},"score":0,"post_id":9174,"edited":false,"creation_date":1389371573,"comment_id":18978,"body":"For the simplicity you get the selection."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oh6VZ.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":6440,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6440/unor","reputation":105,"display_name":"unor"},"score":0,"post_id":9174,"edited":false,"creation_date":1406626475,"comment_id":29961,"body":"If I\u2019m not mistaken, <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3981/trigun99\">trigun99<\/a> <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/revisions/9174/3\">added<\/a> the links; <a href=\"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1757/androidpenguin\">androidpenguin<\/a> approved and formatted the edit."},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/476e67c92121154e7910301e56cdfc4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"registered","user_id":948,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/948/mattdmo","reputation":7591,"display_name":"MattDMo","accept_rate":50},"score":0,"post_id":9174,"reply_to_user":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ay2bH.gif?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":22057,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/22057/david","reputation":1825,"display_name":"David"},"edited":false,"creation_date":1458738290,"comment_id":77650,"body":"@david if you read my answer carefully, you&#39;ll see that I <i>meant<\/i> &quot;genetic code&quot; when I said it.

Proteins are encoded by <strong>genes<\/strong> - while the saying that one gene codes for one protein is now known to be pretty inaccurate (one gene can code for many different variations of the same basic protein), it's a good way to think about things in this context.

In fact, as terdon mentioned in your comment, only about 5% (or less) of those 4 billion letters are in the expressed region of genes - those sequences that directly code for protein. The rest is regulatory, structural, and ... we're not exactly sure. Some call it \"junk DNA\", but it's stuck around for millions of years, so it must have some purpose, we just haven't figured it out yet.

A gene's job is to \"code for\" a protein (first big simplification). However, not <em>all<\/em> of the gene codes for protein, only those parts of it called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon\">exons<\/a> (image modified slightly from <a href=\"http://err.bio.nyu.edu/courses/index.php/Griffin\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MZRny.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The take home message from the image above is that the red bits (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron\">introns<\/a>) are removed and do not affect the final protein product.

It is linearly sequence-dependent, and it is only singly redundant (there are two strands of DNA, so if one strand becomes damaged, it can be recopied from the other one).<\/li>\n<li>Our cells are under unrelenting barrage of oxidative stress, EM radiation, radioactive radiation and physiological stress--this is no exhaustive listing of the constant fight our bodies' cells put up all the time. There are repair mechanisms in place to automatically fix the damage done by high-energy radiation, and if it turns out that a particular cell has sustained too much damage--well, it commits suicide. This process is called apoptosis and its importance ranges from proper embryonic development to prevention of cancers.<\/li>\n<li>In short, there are two ways that excess radiation can cause an organism to die: a) DNA and cellular damage to an irreparable extent, and b) mutagenesis to cause cancers and other cell-cycle diseases.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>We don't quite know the full extent to which we can expose our bodies to long-term high-energy radiation, but the answer is sure very complex. Different tissues, cell lines, and regions of the body receive and cope with radiation in very different ways.<\/p>\n","answer_id":2289,"question_id":2286,"up_vote_count":4,"last_edit_date":1458697648}],"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2286/what-risk-to-dna-does-long-term-exposure-to-low-dose-radiation-pose","last_activity_date":1458697648,"creation_date":1337193048,"answer_count":2,"title":"What risk to DNA does long-term exposure to low-dose radiation pose?","body":"<p>A new study from MIT scientists <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120515181256.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggests that long-term exposure to low-radiation poses no risk of DNA damage<\/a> for mice (it is also important to note that mice are unusually susceptible to cancer).

This leads to a high number of viruses which are non-functional due to this mutations, but also to a few which are better adapted or look different due to this mutation. This can help in evading the immune system (when surface proteins of the virus change) or to adapt better to a host.\nSince the number of viruses in an infected individual is very high (billions of viruses) it doesn't matter and the the mutations which are beneficial for the virus are positively selected for. <\/p>\n\n<p>This can lead to difficulties in the production of vaccines when the proteins used in the vaccine mutate. Usually this is accounted for by using proteins for immunization which only mutate slowly or not (because their function is important and mutations disrupt it).

The currently-accepted theory of the evolution of mitochondria (and possibly other organelles) from free-living <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote\">prokaryotes<\/a> is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis\">symbiogenesis<\/a> and postulates that the mitochondrial progenitors began living symbiotically with the precursors to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote\">eukaryotes<\/a> some 1.5 billion years ago. Life originated on Earth about 3.5 billion years ago, so eukaryotic cells (carrying mitochondria) have been around for a little less than half of that time.<\/p>\n\n<p>In that incredibly large span of time (if you counted 1 number per second, you'd reach 1.5 billion in about 47.5 years), what used to be an independent organism (we assume) has become an organelle - an integral part of the eukaryotic cell. It absolutely could not survive outside the cell on its own, and relies on signals from the cell (mainly, the cell's energy needs as detected by \"sensor\" proteins to key molecules like glucose and ATP) to reproduce.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is most appropriate to think of mitochondria simply as another organelle, just like the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, or the nucleus. It doesn't make sense to think of those other structures as \"alive\" or \"dead\", just as it doesn't make sense to think of mitochondria in the same way. Yes, they <em>used<\/em> to be independent, but are no longer; instead they are a well-integrated part of the whole cell.<\/p>\n","answer_id":36551,"question_id":36546,"up_vote_count":34,"last_edit_date":1438539495},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0b9909cf62b41088184ed8a2e166cc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","user_type":"unregistered","user_id":17093,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/17093/gustav-clark","reputation":41,"display_name":"Gustav Clark"},"score":4,"is_accepted":false,"comments":[{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFUiX.png?s=128&g=1","user_type":"registered","user_id":16882,"link":"http://biology.stackexchange.com/users/16882/james-newton","reputation":276,"display_name":"James Newton","accept_rate":25},"score":1,"post_id":36566,"edited":false,"creation_date":1438534387,"comment_id":60876,"body":"Jeremy England&#39;s hypothesis that life arises naturally as a way to capture energy and dissipate it as heat: <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140122-a-new-physics-theory-of-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\">quantamagazine.org/20140122-a-new-physics-theory-of-life<\/a>"}],"down_vote_count":0,"last_activity_date":1438531199,"creation_date":1438531199,"body":"<p>What a brilliant question for promoting a discussion.
